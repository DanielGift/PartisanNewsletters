On August 25, 2018, we lost a great man, a great leader and a great voice for our home state of Arizona. Throughout his long and distinguished life, Senator McCain personified honorable service to one’s nation. There is no question that with his passing, Senator McCain will serve as a shining example to all who endeavor to a life of service to America. 
Today on the House Floor, I had the distinct honor of presenting the Bereavement Resolution to honor the life and legacy of Senator John McCain.  It was an honor to be included in this morning's ceremony. God bless Senator McCain and his family, may he Rest In Peace. 
Economic Update
Recently our economy has seen amazing growth and I wanted to provide an update on how the U.S. economy is benefiting Arizonans.  ￼￼  Chart to the left: shows the comparison of the U.S. unemployment rate and Arizona unemployment rate. The blue line shows Arizona's unemployment rate and the red line shows the United States.  Chart to the right: shows the increase in nonfarm payroll jobs created in June and July totaling to 2,000 in comparison to the 12 month average of 5,000 jobs. More jobs are being created! ￼
 This graph shows the GDP Growth. In CBO's forecast, real GDP growth spurred by fiscal stimulation is 3.1% this year and 2.4% next year.

WEEKLY MEETING REVIEW
￼
I had great meetings with the Arizona Department of Financial Institutions and the Arizona Department of Insurance. Each meeting involved policy discussion on what Congress is doing to serve these groups, as well as the importance of technology like blockchain that can positively transform policy.
 
￼

I met with Mrs. Carrino and Mrs. Wentzel to talk about the late Mr. Carrino and his service to our country. Mr. William Carrino received Congress’ highest honor, the Congressional Gold Medal for his work in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during World War II. Thank you for joining me to reflect on Mr. Carrino’s unforgettable work. 
 
￼

I also had several office appointments to meet with groups of constituents coming in to discuss issues affecting Arizona.

Dear Friend,   A woman named Mary came into my office recently with two truckers.  Their pensions were in danger.  Mary wanted to livestream the meeting so that truckers around the country could watch.  I said, “Mary, that’s not our policy.  What’s on your mind?”  We just talked.  Mary began to tear up as she explained the dire circumstances in which the two men found themselves.  
It was not the first time I had heard about this problem.  At several town halls a few years back, the multi-employer pension crisis came up.  I listened intently as a constituent named Bob walked me through the harsh realities of exactly how unfair this was.  And I quickly realized that he was exactly right. Many people are affected. 
Multi-employer pension plans are sponsored by employers in the same industry and maintained as part of a collective bargaining agreement.  Here is the problem.  Bad decisions by investment companies, corporations, and unions have left these people vulnerable.  Some of these plans have such insufficient plan assets that they may be unable to pay 100% of the benefits promised to plan participants.  A few very large multi-employer direct benefit pension plans are in such dire financial condition that they are expected to become insolvent within 10 or 20 years.    
Congress created a Joint Select Committee to solve the multi-employer pension crisis with bipartisan legislation by the end of December.  In the meanwhile, I have cosponsored the Rehabilitation for Multi-Employer Pensions Act, which establishes a Pension Rehabilitation Administration within the Department of the Treasury to make loans to multi-employer-defined benefit plans.  I am hopeful that the committee—whose 16 members are evenly split between Democrats and Republicans—can develop a workable legislative approach to address the current crisis and help ensure that we can avoid similar problems in the future for the pension plans of hardworking Americans.    We often hear in political circles that Social Security and Medicare are “entitlements.”  They are not entitlements.  Yes, there are future actuarial concerns, but people worked for the money they paid into those programs.  They deserve their own money, they deserve their own care, they deserve a reasonable retirement.  In the same way, pensions are not entitlements.  Hardworking Americans—plumbers, pipe-fitters, truckers, electricians, teachers—paid into their pension plans, with a reasonable expectation that when they retired that they would have a modest savings for retirement.   
As we head into Labor Day, we need to remind ourselves that some people work with their hands and shower at night; some people work behind a desk and shower in the morning.  At the same time, we all have the same aspirations—to raise a family, give as good a life to our children, and have enough to be secure later on.  Persons with pension plans worked hard, did their duty, and were given a promise.  No one should be told they face a massive cut after they have worked hard their whole life.    
While many of these workers will not get all their money back, the principles of fairness, dignity, and compassion mandates that Congress, in a bipartisan manner, lays down a mark for a constructive solution.  Therein lies the deeper meaning of Labor Day.       Sincerely, ￼  Congressman Jeff Fortenberry

Dear Friend, 
As the House and Senate move forward in negotiations on a final version of the 2018 Farm Bill, I wanted to send along my op-ed from Lubbock Lights that discusses the importance of this year's Farm Bill to the agriculture sector in West Texas and rural America. 
￼ 
West Texas has seats at the table when it comes time to finish crafting a Farm Bill to ensure a strong, viable ag sector for West Texas and rural America  By Representative Jodey Arrington  August 29, 2018  https://bit.ly/2wwNZcl 
Now that the House and Senate have passed their respective versions of the Farm Bill, a bipartisan “conference committee” made up of both House and Senate members has been established to work out the differences between the two and send a final version to the president’s desk.
I am honored to have been appointed by the Speaker to serve on the Committee and thrilled to work alongside my friend and fellow West Texan, Chairman Mike Conaway. Our mission is straightforward and clear: to establish policies that support a vibrant agriculture economy, strengthen rural communities, maintain food security in America and tighten up work requirements for food stamp recipients.
West Texas will get two voices for the price of one with Mike and me at the table. That is only appropriate since our region is one of the largest agriculture production centers in the world. The Farm Bill represents more than just economic development for rural communities or even the 20 million agriculture-related jobs in the United States. Getting U.S. agriculture policy right is about maintaining our ability to feed and clothe our own citizens independent of foreign sources of food and fiber – a national security issue for all Americans. When you combine food security with energy independence, there is not a more important region in the country than West Texas – the food, fuel and fiber capital of the world!
This Farm Bill comes at one of the most challenging economic times for the agriculture industry in our nation’s history. Since the last Farm Bill in 2014, net farm income has dropped more than 50 percent – the steepest decline since the Great Depression – and farm bankruptcies are up nearly 40 percent over the past two years.
The biggest brunt of this downturn was borne by our cotton producers who were completely exposed to the commodity market’s nosedive after being the only row crop removed from Title I of the Farm Bill’s safety net in 2014. Fortunately, we were able to restore cotton’s safety net status, and furthermore, improve it by covering the value of cotton as a seed as well as a lint. That is the most significant feature of this new Farm Bill for folks living in the largest cotton patch in the world, but we must also establish the right agriculture policies for all commodities in order to deal with the new market realities of 2018 and beyond.
Farm Bills come once every five years and not only set our nation’s agriculture policy, but also include funding for one of the largest welfare programs – the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps. SNAP accounts for more than 80 percent of the Farm Bill’s funding and costs taxpayers more than $70 billion a year. Keep this in mind: the total cost of U.S. agriculture policies (apart from the food stamp program) is less than half of one percent of the entire federal budget. That’s a small cost to taxpayers for the enormous benefit of a stable and affordable food supply.
With our economy growing at historic rates, unemployment at historic lows and nearly 7 million surplus jobs, I believe it would be a travesty not to reform the food stamp program so we end policies trapping people in a perpetual cycle of dependence on the government. Sadly, millions of able-bodied adults are using the welfare system in this country as a lifestyle with no intention of getting a job. Any responsible welfare program – whether it has to do with food, health care, or housing – must encourage work-capable people to maximize their God-given talents and seize workforce training and employment opportunities that will not only benefit them and their families, but our entire economy and future prosperity.
The House Farm Bill will be my benchmark going into these negotiations. However, given the 60-vote rule in the Senate, we will need the support of at least ten Democrats in order to pass it. Whatever compromise is reached, we must ensure our final legislation achieves three key objectives: first, a viable and responsible safety net for all commodities; second, an investment in broadband technology, water conservation, and other critical infrastructure for sustaining rural communities; and third, long-overdue reforms to the food stamp program to encourage able-bodied adults to work.
If we get this Farm Bill right, we will not only ensure a strong, viable ag sector for West Texas and rural America, but we can ensure our economy continues to grow and that all Americans have the opportunity for a better quality of life. 
Congressman Jodey Arrington is a member of the U.S. House of Representatives serving the Nineteenth Congressional District of Texas. He serves as a member of the Farm Bill Conference Committee, House Agriculture Committee, House Budget Committee, Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform, and Chairman of the House Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity.

ICYMI: CDC Director Visits Huntington
I was pleased to welcome the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director, Dr. Robert Redfield to Huntington on Monday.   Dr. Redfield discussed the opioid epidemic at the Cabell Huntington Hospital’s Regional Health Summit. Dr. Redfield and I also toured Lily’s Place, the nation’s first purpose-built neonatal abstinence syndrome treatment facility.   Dr. Redfield and I both believe the opioid epidemic is the public health crisis of our time and applaud the work that the Huntington community is doing in helping put an end to the opioid epidemic.

McDowell County PSD Receives $1.1 Million Grant
I am pleased to announce that the McDowell County PSD has received a $1.18 million grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Water and Waste Disposal Loans and Grants program.  This grant will be used to replace failing water systems in the towns of Kimball and Northfork and the city of Keystone.

CALLING ALL INTERNS
￼ 
My office is now accepting applications for interns in my Washington, D.C. office, as well as my district offices in Rogers, Fort Smith, and Harrison.
A congressional internship is a rewarding experience, and both Washington, D.C. and district office interns will work closely with my staff and constituents while learning the inner workings of the United States Congress and about issues affecting Arkansans. College students and recent graduates interested in political science, government, public policy, business, and social work are encouraged to apply.
Internship requirements and application materials are available on my website. For more information, please call my office at (202) 225-4301 and ask to speak with the internship coordinator. 
WEEK IN REVIEW
￼
To start off this week's From the Front... I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nation’s capital, including Thomas and Roxanne Benincosa from Springdale, the Wallace family from Dover, the Ruple family from Hector, and members of the University of Arkansas Fulbright Exchange Program. Safe travels back to the Natural State.
On Monday, I traveled to Fort Worth, Texas, with Congresswoman Kay Granger and Congressman John Carter to tour the F-35 Lightning II Plant. Developed by Lockheed Martin, the F-35 Lightning II is a fifth-generation combat aircraft. It is the world’s most advanced multi-role fighter – providing unmatched capabilities to military forces around the world, securing high-tech, high-skill jobs for hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, and elevating international security by allowing for more integrated coalition operations. Thank you, Congresswoman Granger, for hosting me— I enjoyed learning more about the F-35 Lightning II and the important role it has for securing our nation.
￼
During this final week of the August district work period, I had the opportunity to visit with a number of constituents all over the district. I began my Tuesday speaking at the Rogers Noon Rotary Club on recent legislation passed in the House and answering questions. I discussed my job as Chairman of the House Budget Committee, where we have passed through Committee our Budget for a Brighter American Future, and my role as co-chair of the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform. This Joint Select Committee has been tasked with reforming our flawed budget and appropriations process. Without question, the Joint Select Committee shares the common goal of having an effective budget and appropriations process, and as we determine fixes to the current process, it is my hope that we recommend a framework that works regardless of who holds the majority.
On Tuesday afternoon, I met with some of the athletes who represented the state of Arkansas at the 2018 USA Special Olympics Games, held earlier this summer in Oregon. With 75 athletes participating, Team Arkansas won 35 Gold Medals, 26 Silver Medals, and 54 Bronze Medals. Great job, Team Arkansas! Thank you for stopping by my office!
￼
On Wednesday morning, I headed to the northeastern part of the Third District to visit the new Vexus Boat facility in Flippin. They are a fishing boat manufacturer offering fiberglass and aluminum designed fishing boats. I had a great time touring the facility and learning more about the boat manufacturing industry. After visiting Vexus Boat, I stopped by the new Butterball Feed Mill in Yellville, which is currently under construction. The Yellville plant will produce about 12,000 tons of feed per week and costs about $50 million. 
That afternoon, I joined the Harrison Noon Lions Club for lunch and discussed recent legislation that has been passed in both the House and Senate, as well as current bills being considered in the House. I then spoke at the Industrial Alliance meeting. Industrial Alliance partners with area industries and schools to mediate the needs of area manufacturing facilities and the abilities of students seeking careers. Manufacturers around the area send two employees to discuss manufacturing issues, common challenges, economic development and support of the community. The manufacturing industry is quickly evolving, and there is a need for skilled workers. This meeting gives manufacturing officials and educators the opportunity to begin talking about the needs for an educated and qualified workforce.
￼
I wrapped up my Wednesday with a visit to Pace Industries in Harrison, where I toured their new robotics technology. Pace Industries is an integrated company that provides high quality die casting, manufacturing, and engineering solutions in Arkansas and across the world. The Harrison Division started as a small die caster in the mid-1960’s and since then has been known as a leader in the thin-wall die casting industry. Thank you to letting me stop by!
I began my Thursday morning in Fort Smith speaking with Future School students and faculty. The Future School of Fort Smith is a tuition-free, public charter high school centered on a personalized approach to learning via student-designed internships, personalized learning plans, and an advisor for each student. They serve 10-12th grade students, as well as the needs of their families and community. Their student-centered model engages students from all backgrounds. They sincerely believe in the potential for each student to identify interests, cultivate in-demand skills, and graduate ready for the world through partnerships with local K-12, higher education, business and community organizations.
￼
I attended the Fort Smith Noon Kiwanis Club on Thursday afternoon. I gave them an update on the happenings in Congress and legislation relevant to the Third District. I then toured the Arkansas Colleges of Health Education. The school opened its doors to its inaugural class of 150 students in August 2017. The Arkansas Colleges of Health Education recently broke ground on an $11 million, 6.6-acre development across from the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine. Many thanks to Kyle Parker and the faculty of ACHE for hosting me.
￼
I ended my Thursday touring the new Arkansas Game and Fish Commission Facility at Chaffee Crossing. The facility opened June 11, 2018, to office 14 employees in the office, as well as field staff. Arkansas Game and Fish Commission oversees the protection, conservation, and preservation of various species of fish and wildlife in Arkansas. Thank you to the staff and member of the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission for working to preserve the Natural State and all its wonders!
On Friday, I had the opportunity to visit two local farms in Lincoln – the Pharr Family Livestock and Poultry Farm and the Moore Family Farm. Agriculture is vital to the Arkansas economy – especially in the Third District. Did you know that the top-two farm income counties in Arkansas are in it? I was happy to take the opportunity to discuss how the upcoming Farm Bill will ensure our nation’s agricultural policies reflect what is best for Arkansas.
I ended my Friday meeting with the employees at Fossil Cove Brewing Company, where I received a tour of their facility. Fossil Cove Brewing Company is Northwest Arkansas’s fastest growing brewer. The company is named after the favorite fossil laden cove on the shores of Beaver Lake, which is also the brewery’s water source. Thanks for letting me stop by!
Next week, I will be heading back to Washington, D.C., to resume Congress’s legislative business. Remember to keep an eye on my website or check out my Twitter and Instagram pages to stay up-to-date with the latest news from the Third District and Washington. 
POLICY UPDATE: MAIN STREET BANKS
Traveling through the Third District this month, I am so proud to see how much Northwest Arkansas continues to grow. It seems like a new business is starting up every day, and the housing market is booming. To continue the incredible growth, we need to ensure our regional and community banks, along with our credit unions, are not unnecessarily overregulated. Banks should not be a hindrance to the growth; they should be a of a shepherd of it. 
On March 24, 2018, S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law. This Congress, I gladly voted in support of the bill for the relief it would give the Third District of Arkansas. A combination of previously passed bipartisan House of Representatives and Senate bills, this bill provided relief to the smaller guys, regional banks on down to community banks and credit unions that were crushed by regulations intended for big banks. In the wake of the banking crisis in 2008, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, along with other regulatory bills to address the lack of oversight in the major banks and mortgage market. While the intent was good, the new regulations were a one-size-fits-all approach that drowned our community banks. S. 2155 combines legislation Congress passed to roll back and amend some of these oppressive, Obama-era regulations so they are tailored to a financial institution’s size.   
Oversight can be good, but there is a responsibility that we have to ensure regulations are protecting consumers and banks, not bogging them down in compliance. The bipartisan legislation in S. 2155 includes the CHOICE Act, which among other things, provides relief to Main Street banks and their consumers by ensuring access to manufactured housing and enabling lenders to increase access to affordable credit. The bill also included provisions that extend safe harbor for loans held in smaller financial institutions, allowing our local banks to expand access to mortgage credit. Now, people in the Third District and across the nation are getting the help they need to buy that car for which they have been saving to get to their job or to make the dream of being a homeowner a reality because their local bank is able to better serve them.
Our work is not done. There is still more to do, and my time in the Third District has made me even more determined to support legislation that will help our Main Street bankers – so they can help our communities. Luckily, there are Members of Congress with the same resolve, and I look forward to returning to Washington D.C. to continue the momentum. 

From the front...

America mourns Sen. McCain. With this week’s passing of Senator John McCain, America has lost a public servant of deep patriotism, outstanding bravery and undaunted spirit. Compelled by his unshakeable faith and deep love of country, John McCain dedicated his life to defending America and the ideals on which she is built. He fought tirelessly to ensure that our nation always remains a land of justice, freedom and hope. In Congress, his willingness to bridge the partisan divide will be sorely missed. Andrea and I shall keep Senator McCain in our prayers. We will hold his wife, Cindy, and all his family in our thoughts during this difficult time. 
 
 

Food benefits grew. More Marianas families received help and benefits increased, as we worked successfully in Congress over the last 10 years, getting more money for food assistance in the Marianas. 
 

More families to get food aid

Another 829 households will be eligible for food stamps on October 1. The Commonwealth has decided to make use of $20 million still remaining from the SNAP pilot program that I included as Section 4031 of the Agricultural Act of 2014. Governor Torres made the announcement last Friday at his State of the Commonwealth Address. I have been urging this action since March, when House Agriculture Committee staff and the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported to me that the Commonwealth had $22.5 million in unspent food stamp money. Once we made that information public, the Commonwealth raised benefits significantly. Monthly benefits for a family of four on Saipan went from $686 to $944 dollars, on Tinian from $744 to $998, and on Rota from $897 to $1,150. Some 2,600 families benefited. But money remained unused. With more families becoming eligible on October 1, financial projections from the Commonwealth Department of Community and Cultural Affairs now show a surplus of only $2.4 million at the end of 2021, a substantial improvement over the $17.4 million projection for that year provided to me by the Food and Nutrition Service in May. 
 

Fix the Farm Bill

The Farm Bill that passed the House by 2 votes in June included highly-publicized, unnecessary and objectionable cuts and changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Less noticed, but just as important, was the bill’s rollbacks and cuts to a number of important environmental protection and conservation laws and programs that would badly impact public health. This week I joined with over 100 of my colleagues in a letter to the Farm Bill conference leaders outlining our objections to any conference report that would undermine investments in critical conservation programs or our nation’s bedrock environmental laws. The anti-environment and health provisions range from eliminating drinking water protections to forestry management changes to disincentivizing farmers' conservation efforts. They should not be included in the final bill. 
 

Protecting Net Neutrality

Net Neutrality rules put the power in the hands of the internet user and prevents internet providers from blocking, slowing or discriminating against content online. This is a position I've long taken on behalf of internet users of the Marianas. In Congress, I cosponsored a Congressional Review Act Resolution to overturn the Trump FCC decision to eliminate these pro-consumer rules. This week I joined 26 Senators and 75 of my House colleagues in an amicus brief supporting Net Neutrality in the case of Mozilla Corp. v FCC. Our brief joins with consumer advocates, tech companies, small businesses, and state Attorneys General who have all mobilized to win this fight. 
 

Court Ruling Protects Federal Workers

Federal workers won an important victory this past weekend when a federal judge ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority in his attempt to curtail collective bargaining rights by Executive Order. The 122-page opinion from the U.S. District Court struck down significant sections of three Executive Orders issued this past May ruling that Congress had established collective bargaining rights for federal employees through legislation. Federal employee unions sued the President arguing that he was unilaterally dictating new terms to labor contracts that had already been negotiated. Federal workers work hard and serve our nation. I will continue to support efforts, as a senior Member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, to ensure that the pay, benefits, and rights of federal workers are not unfairly cut.    

 
 

Let's Read, Kingfishers! William S. Reyes Elementary School received seven boxes of children’s books for their library when I visited on Wednesday. Thanks to WSR librarian Arthur Sondheim and the young kingfishers from Mrs. Divina Dela Cruz’s class for the very warm welcome. The book drop was part of your congressional office’s ongoing “Let’s Read!” initiative. Since my first term in office, we have collected 50,000 brand-new books from the Library of Congress’ Surplus Books Program for delivery to schools, libraries, and nonprofit organizations throughout the Marianas. We are counting down to delivery of book #50,000, which is now in the mail! 
 

No school funds for guns

On Tuesday, 172 of my House Democratic colleagues and I sent a letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos requesting she provide clear guidance prohibiting the use of federal education funding to purchase guns to arm teachers and staff. Our letter was necessitated by a report that exposed her Department’s consideration of proposals that would enable schools to divert education funds to pay for firearms and firearms training. Secretary DeVos is reportedly reviewing plans to permit schools to use Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants authorized under Title IV-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) to arm school personnel. When Congress worked on reauthorizing ESEA, which became law in 2015, we provided funding flexibility so that school districts could address local issues. In the Northern Marianas, Title IV-A funds pay for student participation in Advanced Placement classes, student competitions, and various technology programs. We never intended program flexibility be used to arm teachers. In fact, the law explicitly states that program activities support “a school environment free of weapons.” Our schools should provide a safe and welcoming environment conducive to learning for all students and school staff. 
 

Protecting college students

All Democratic Members on the Committee on Education and the Workforce also sent a letter to Education Secretary DeVos today opposing her Department’s proposed rule that will hurt college students defrauded by for-profit institutions. The proposed rule on borrower defense to repayment would essentially undo debt relief for defrauded students with federal student loans. The Obama Administration finalized regulations in 2016, following the closures of Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute, to create more efficient methods to help defrauded students. After multiple delays, the Trump Administration proposed changes that would strip protections for students taken advantage of by predatory for-profit colleges and make it much harder to get their federal student loans discharged. Borrower defense – a legal right created by Congress – is an important consumer protection rule in higher education. Secretary DeVos must abandon her proposed changes to the borrower defense rule. Instead, we should be working to protect students and taxpayers while holding predatory institutions accountable. 
 

$579K to CNMI Homeland Security

The CNMI Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management has been awarded $579,981 under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program. The grant, administered by the National Weather Service, will be used to purchase tsunami sirens for Saipan, provide outreach and education, replace signage, obtain and distribute tsunami awareness materials, and conduct tsunami exercises with key staff and stakeholders. Congratulations to HSEM!
 
 

Marianas quarter unveiled. The U.S. Mint unveiled the 2019 quarter designs in their ""America the Beautiful"" series which includes our new Marianas quarter. Each of the America the Beautiful quarters features a national park or site, and ours features a Chamolinian girl at American Memorial Park. These five designs will go into circulation next year.

The Nation Is In Tears


￼
An American Hero 
The nation is in tears.  With the passing of John McCain, Congress and America have lost a leader and public servant of deep patriotism, outstanding bravery and undaunted spirit.  Compelled by his unshakeable faith and deep love of country, he dedicated his life to defending both America and the American idea – fighting tirelessly to ensure that our nation always remains a land of justice, freedom and hope.  
Over the course of John McCain’s years of distinguished service, whether as a naval officer, Member of Congress, U.S. Senator or presidential candidate, we all saw firsthand his integrity, humility, courage and grace.  He never forgot the great duty he felt to care for our nation’s heroes, dedicating his spirit and energy to ensuring that no man or woman in uniform was left behind on the battlefield or once they returned home.
Paul and I join with all Americans in mourning the loss of this extraordinary national hero.  May it be a comfort to his wife, Cindy, and his beloved children, Douglas, Andrew, Sidney, Meghan, John, James and Bridget, and his beautiful mother, Roberta, that so many people in America and around with the world mourn with them and pray for them during this sad time.

Dear  , 
There has been a lot of talk in recent weeks on how important our ports and maritime commerce are to the economy of our region and state. According to one estimate, the maritime economy in our region supports nearly 30,000 jobs and over $14 billion in economic output in the eastern Long Island Sound. Earlier this month, the Connecticut Port Authority recently unveiled its five-year plan for tapping into the energy that exists today in our maritime economy and taking full advantage of the potential for growth.
It was good timing then that Admiral Mark Buzby (retired), Administrator of the federal Maritime Administration (MARAD), took me up on my offer to visit eastern Connecticut. As ranking member of the House Seapower Subcommittee, my panel has oversight over many of the important functions of MARAD. Earlier this year, I asked Admiral Buzby to come to the district to see how our state and region is focused on boosting maritime activity, and how we have put federal MARAD funding to good use.
￼

Preserving our region's maritime heritage  
Our first stop was the crown jewel of maritime heritage museums, Mystic Seaport, where we met with state and regional maritime stakeholders. We discussed important issues like workforce development, commercial fisheries, and dredging. Admiral Buzby updated Connecticut stakeholders on the work MARAD does to ensure the safety and viability of the merchant marine. The Seaport is America’s largest maritime heritage museum, and has been the recipient of several MARAD Federal Maritime Heritage Grants, totaling to more than $220,000 since 2014. These grants, which I have worked to restart after years of dormancy, help institutions like the Seaport preserve and restore important elements of our nation's maritime heritage. As Admiral Buzby said during his visit, seeing the results of the grants “renews my understanding of how important those grants are going forward and how we need to keep that program healthy in the future.”  
￼

Supporting the Marine Highway 
Admiral Buzby and I then took a high-speed ferry with Cross Sound Ferry in New London to visit Thames Shipyard. Earlier this month, Cross Sound Ferry received a $500,000 federal “marine highway” grant from MARAD. This funding is used to support improvements that help take cargo and people off our highways by transporting them on our waterways. As part of the M-295 Marine Highway, Cross Sound Ferry’s fleet provides over 12,000 one-way vessel trips, helping eliminate road congestion between Connecticut and New York. The funding they have received from MARAD will help replace pilings, upgrade ferry platforms, restore a high-speed ferry slip and dredge the terminal.
￼
Congressman Courtney and Admiral Buzby riding the high-speed ferry with Cross Sound Ferry in New London
Growth and Potential in New London 
Next, we joined officials from the Connecticut Port Authority for a tour of the New London State Pier. Expanding the utilization of the pier is a major piece of the Connecticut Port Authority’s five-year maritime strategy. With a protected deep-water port, a great location between New York and Boston, and a thriving maritime industry, there is ample opportunity for growth and development. As Admiral Buzby discussed with New London Day, ports like New London are poised for new business as more goods and products are shipped on the water. 
This visit was also an opportunity to highlight the importance of an interconnected, intermodal approach to expanding our ports. I updated Admiral Buzby on the New England Central Rail (NECR) rail line expansion that received $8 million in federal funds. That project will increase freight rail capacity to and from New London, up to Canada, and ensure that the port can move more goods and products. 
￼

Appreciating the importance of small shipyards 
We ended the day with a visit to Essex Boat Works (EBW). Founded in 1812, EBW is a full-service yacht yard and marina. They are currently expanding and will soon have a waterfront restaurant and a new marina building. MARAD’s responsibility covers shipyards big and small, and our visit was a good chance for the administrator to see firsthand the important role of shipyards like EBW.
￼

I am always excited to host officials like Admiral Buzby on the ground in our region because it puts a face on the work that we are doing in eastern Connecticut, and the impact of the work agencies like his are doing in Washington. Thank you for taking the time to read this update. As always, please do not hesitate to contact my office at (860) 886-0139 with any questions or concerns.  
Have a great weekend,

Dear Friend,
Throughout August, we celebrated the anniversary of Medicare and Social Security, two important programs that are critical to ensuring that seniors can live their lives with dignity and independence. Despite the success of these programs, congressional Republicans and President Trump remain intent on making deep cuts to their budgets to pay for tax breaks for the super-wealthy and big corporations.
Jeopardizing the health care and livelihoods of millions of seniors to subsidize the lifestyles of the wealthy is wrong. Instead of cutting these programs, I’m dedicated to expanding and improving upon them. Throughout my time in Congress, I’ve led the way in protecting Social Security and ensuring that beneficiaries receive the full compensation they have earned.
For far too long, our seniors have helplessly watched as their already meager benefits fail to keep pace with inflation. Thanks to a 1996 law, some seniors face garnished benefits to satisfy the payment of old debts—including Veterans Administration Home Loans, food stamp overpayments, and student loan debt. That’s why I introduced the Protection of Social Security Benefits Restoration Act (H.R. 4500) to put the prohibition on garnishing Social Security benefits back in place, so that seniors can once again count on their benefits—no matter what. I’m also leading the fight to oppose every effort by Republicans to make cuts to Social Security or attempt to privatize it.
According to a recent budget proposal from the GOP and numerous pledges from congressional Republicans to make cuts to the safety net, Medicare is also on the chopping block. In Arizona alone, more than 1.1 million residents depend on Medicare for insurance coverage. It is cruel and unfair to rip coverage away from some of our most vulnerable populations to simply pay down a debt substantially enlarged by a wasteful Republican tax plan.
Medicare is popular, provides great coverage, and ensures that our seniors and those with disabilities won’t be bankrupted by their medical needs. I support improving Medicare so that it can cover more services like hearing, dental and vision and expanding it to more people through the Medicare for All Act. No one—no matter their income level, age, or preexisting condition—should be denied the care they need or have to worry about a huge medical bill when they are on hard times.
In light of the constant attacks on Medicare and Social Security by President Trump and congressional Republicans, I remain even more dedicated to protecting and expanding them so that their benefits can be enjoyed for generations to come. As we celebrate each of their anniversaries this month, let’s remember their storied legacy and the critical role they have played in ensuring that our seniors are well taken care of in their later years. These are the landmark American programs we must protect.
Peace,
￼

Remembering the Maverick
By Sen. John Thune
 
Until John McCain’s passing, I had the distinct honor of serving alongside him for the entirety of my Senate career. And while John loved the Senate and a good, fiery debate (I know firsthand, having been on the receiving end of a few of them myself), he loved nothing more than his friends, family, and the country for which he fought and served for the better part of his life.
 
There aren’t enough words to truly describe John and what he meant to everyone who knew him – even those who didn’t, but who, having known John’s story, always felt like they did. He was smart, thoughtful, witty, courageous, and he was always humble enough to admit when he was wrong or had made a mistake. He was true to himself, and he embodied the American spirit. (to read the rest of this column, click here)

Dear Friend, 
This week, I paid tribute to the heroism and dignified public service that the late Arizona Senator John McCain rendered to our country. I also commemorated the 55th anniversary of the historic March on Washington at which Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have A Dream” speech; attended the swearing-in ceremony for new Shelby County Major Lee Harris, the county commission and other elected county officials; thanked two U.S. Senators for their efforts to prevent injury to Tennessee Walking Horses; announced a major investment in affordable housing; praised California for being the first state to end money bail as a condition of pretrial release in criminal cases; talked with our troops at a base in Honduras; remembered Aretha Franklin; planned to host a Military Service Academy Day next month and offered a health tip. Keep reading to learn more about my week and follow me on Twitter and Facebook to see more updates as they happen.

Honoring the Memory of Senator John McCain 
￼  
Since the announcement of his death last Saturday night, the country has been in mourning while at the same time celebrating the amazing life of Senator John McCain, a true military hero, a Senator who stood up to our current President who he felt, as I do, is a threat to democracy, and a larger-than-life figure in our country’s history. His example of decorous respect for our traditions, and his insistence that there is more that unites us than divides us, will remain his never ending tribute to our country. I was pleased to hear former Vice President Joe Biden extol his old friend’s virtues at the memorial service in Arizona Thursday and to watch the moving ceremony from the U.S. Capitol Rotunda on Friday. I look forward to the eulogies to be offered Saturday at the National Cathedral in Washington by McCain’s former rivals for the presidency, Barack Obama and George W. Bush. McCain’s service to our country, as a Naval aviator, prisoner of war, Congressman, Senator and noble citizen won’t be forgotten. I agree with Senator Chuck Schumer that the Russell Senate Office Building should be named in his honor. I extend my deepest condolences to McCain’s family, his colleagues and his many friends, including Fred Smith, who will be a pallbearer. 
Commemorating the 55th Anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington 
￼  
On Tuesday, I noted the 55th anniversary of the historic March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom that brought a quarter of a million people to the National Mall to hear Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his “I Have a Dream” speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial while millions more watched on television. On that hot day in 1963, the March on Washington brought together the nation’s greatest civil rights and labor leaders to demand an end to racial discrimination. Many tens of thousands heard labor leader A. Phillip Randolph, Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) leader and future Georgia Congressman John Lewis, Roy Wilkins of the NAACP and others address the need for federal legislation guaranteeing civil and voting rights. The day’s triumphant and dramatic climax was Dr. King’s unforgettable “dream” of one day living in a land where his children would “not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.” It’s a message as relevant now as it was then as we continue working to achieve that dream and remember this important anniversary.
Attending the Swearing-In of New Shelby County Officials 
￼ 
On Thursday, I went to the Cannon Center for the Performing Arts after receiving personal invitations from County Mayor-elect Lee Harris and Commissioner-elect Tami Sawyer to witness the swearing-in of Mayor Harris, the county commissioners and newly elected Circuit Court Clerk Temiika Gipson, County Trustee Regina Morrison Newman, County Assessor Melvin Burgess, County Clerk Wanda Halbert, Register of Deeds Shelandra Ford, Criminal Court Clerk Heidi Kuhn, Juvenile Court Clerk Janis Fullilove and Probate Court Clerk Bill Morrison. My office works closely with county government at all levels and I was there to assure the newly elected representatives that that seamless cooperation will continue. 
Working to Prevent Injury to Horses 
 ￼ 
Also on Tuesday, I commended Senators Mike Crapo of Idaho and Mark Warner of Virginia for their recent letter to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue requesting the department vigorously enforce the Horse Protection Act and prevent the intentional injury to horses participating in the ongoing Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration in Shelbyville. The Senators’ letter interceding on behalf of horses and horse lovers asked Perdue for a vigilant inspection regimen at this year’s Tennessee Walking Horse Celebration to assure the cruel practice of horse soring does not occur. Unfortunately, some participants in the past have used various painful techniques, including acid, to make the gait of Tennessee’s iconic Walking Horses more dramatic in an effort to win prize money. USDA inspectors are critical to the prevention of these practices, and I join the Senators in calling for their active review. I am the lead sponsor of the Prevent All Soring Tactics (PAST) Act (H.R. 1847) introduced in March 2017 and have been a leader on legislation to prevent horse soring since I arrived in Congress. The primary opposition to the humane treatment of horses has come from Congressman Marsha Blackburn, who has long favored those inflicting these horrific cruelties over the suffering of the horses. 
Announcing $14.2 million Federal Investment to Support Affordable Housing 
On Thursday, I announced that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is investing $14,254,835 in federal funds to combat homelessness and support affordable housing programs and facilities for vulnerable populations throughout Memphis. The funding comes through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) HOME Investment Partnership program, Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS program, Community Development Block Grant program, and Emergency Solutions Grants program. Access to affordable, quality housing is a staple of health, happiness, safety and success. These federal funds are needed in Memphis and Shelby County, and they will help to further develop and maintain affordable housing throughout the Ninth Congressional District. 

Praising California State Lawmakers for Ending Cash-Bail System 
￼ 
On Wednesday, California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law a bill that will eliminate the cash-bail system for pretrial detainees, leaving pretrial release of defendants up to state trial judges. The bill reforms the pretrial release system so rich and poor people are treated the same and it is expected to reduce the pretrial jail population for those who have not been convicted of a crime. The No Money Bail Act (H.R. 1437) I have cosponsored would create incentives for states to make similar reforms. California has taken a step the rest of the nation should follow, and I commend its lawmakers for this thoughtful move. 
Talking with Our Troops in Honduras 
￼  
I have just returned from a trip to visit our troops in the Southern Command at Soto Cano Air Base in Honduras. There I talked with service members, including several from Tennessee, and thanked them for their sacrifice. I especially appreciated my opportunity to meet with U.S. Army Sergeant Aaron Wright of Memphis, a Craigmont High School graduate, about his unit’s mission in Central America. We also talked about Penny and the football season and his football coach father. It was a good visit. 
Remembering the Queen of Soul 
￼ 
On Friday, the nation turned its eyes on Detroit for the final sendoff of Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul. From her humble origins – she was born at 406 Lucy Street in South Memphis -- to her consistent place atop the Billboard charts, Aretha Franklin was one of a kind. It was nice to see the star-studded assembly swaying to the Gospel songs she sang from earliest childhood in her own inimitable style and to feel the deep R-E-S-P-E-C-T she was shown by the people of our country and music lovers the world over. Rest in Peace, Aretha Franklin. 
Hosting Military Service Academy-Senior ROTC Day  
￼ 
On Saturday, September 29, I will host the annual Military Service Academy-Senior Reserve Officer Training Day at Crosstown High School, 1365 Tower Avenue, from 9 a.m. to noon. Appointments to one of the five military service academies – for the Navy, Air Force, Army, Merchant Marines or Coast Guard -- are life-changing events and lead to preparation of future military officers while chosen students get an excellent education and a ticket to a bright future. I look forward to seeing some aspiring applicants at the Crosstown Concourse. The high school is on the fourth floor. For more information, contact Jeremy Jordan in my Memphis office at (901) 544-4131 or Jeremy.Jordan@mail.house.gov 
Signing Up for “Congress On Your Corner” and this e-Newsletter 
￼ 
I enjoy meeting regularly with constituents in the district and helping get answers for them to questions about dealing with federal agencies. If you are interested in attending one of my “Congress on Your Corner” events, you can sign up here to receive notification as soon as the next event is scheduled. 
For those who haven’t participated in a telephone town hall, it’s easy to sign up for them by using this form.   
If you would like to receive this weekly e-Newsletter, or share it with others, you can do that with this form. 
Weekly Health Tip 
￼ 
Each week, I share a health tip in the hope of promoting a healthy lifestyle for residents of the 9th Congressional District. As always, it is best to check with your doctor before making any changes to your diet, exercise routine or lifestyle.
Pancreatic cancer, the disease that claimed the life of Aretha Franklin, is one of the deadliest cancers with the lowest survival rate at just 9 percent and its incidence has been rising each year. Unfortunately, it has only vague symptoms that can be confused with other abdominal or gastrointestinal issues and the cause of pancreatic cancer remains unknown. Tobacco use is considered a likely risk factor and African Americans are at a slightly higher risk for the disease. The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCan.org) acts as a support system for those who need it. More information on pancreatic cancer from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can be found here. 
Quote of the Week  
￼ 
“We weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe. We weaken it when we hide behind walls rather than tear them down, when we doubt the power of our ideals rather than trust them to be the great force for change they have always been.” -- John McCain’s Final Statement, released Monday. 
Have a safe and happy Labor Day. I’ll be at the AFL-CIO Labor Day Picnic on Monday. 
As always,  I remain 
Most sincerely,

Dear Friend, 

I can't help but be excited about our future!  I've traveled over 2,000 miles in August, meeting with hardworking people in every corner of the First District.  They love this nation as much as I do.  Thanks to all of you who have invited me into your homes and businesses to share your thoughts and concerns with a focus on making America great again.  Your encouragement and advice energized me.  I'm focused on making sure your voice is heard on Capitol Hill.

Stark Aerospace in Columbus celebrated a milestone this week.  The company delivered their first ""Made in Mississippi"" Arrow-3 Anti-Missile canister to its parent company Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI).  It was an honor to join Governor Phil Bryant, members of the Mississippi Congressional Delegation, and senior officials of the Israeli Ministry of Defense (IMOD) for the ribbon cutting ceremony.

￼
                                            
This was also a celebration of the strong relationship our state and nation have with Israel, America's most trusted ally in the Middle East.  Because of the expertise of the Stark workforce, Israel will be better able to defend themselves against longer range, higher altitude ballistic missiles.  I look forward to more partnerships between Israel and Mississippi's defense manufacturers in the future.  
                                            

MUELLER INDUSTRIES

Congratulations to Mueller Industries in Fulton.  The company, a manufacturer of plumbing, HVAC, refrigeration and industrial products, has expanded with new warehousing and distribution operations, an investment of $3.83 million.  The addition of 60 jobs brings their total employment to 615 team members.

￼

The company has relied on hardworking Mississippians to achieve their production goals since the late 60's.  I am grateful for Mueller Industries' faith in our workforce and for their investment in our great state.


SAFER COMMUNITIES


￼
ATF Special Agent Joe Frank, First Judicial 
District District Attorney John Weddle and 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Clay Joyner

I applaud our law enforcement officers in the First District and across Mississippi who risk their lives every day to protect ours.  These men and women strive to make our communities safer - usually on a tight budget.  It is encouraging to see the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms assist them with technology that is helping them to identify, locate, arrest, and prosecute violent offenders.

Recently, Oxford-based ATF special agents came to Tupelo with a National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) mobile lab, which allows NIBIN technicians to examine and compare test-fired shell casings from crime guns as well as shell casings collected as crime scene evidence.  Technicians examine and classify the unique ""fingerprint"" each firearm imparts on a shell casing.  Each shell casing's ""fingerprint"" is entered into the NIBIN database and compared for the purpose of producing NIBIN leads.

""As an ATF agent working in north Mississippi, I'm encouraged by the cooperative efforts of state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies in this area,"" Special Agent David Erhart said.  ""Since Mississippi started using the NIBIN system in 1998, law enforcement agencies have received a total of 237 NIBIN leads - eight of which were generated during the last two weeks.""
                                            

HARVEST SEASON

Harvest season has begun in the district.  Cecil Ferrell, a West Point native, is hopeful for good corn and soybean yields.  Like other farmers, Cecil is concerned about tariffs and any potential impact they may have on his bottom line.  He and I share in the belief that President Trump's trade negotiations with other countries is the best way to achieve fairness for all involved.  

￼

While these important discussions take place, we will continue our work on the next Farm Bill.  Input from our farmers has been a critical part of crafting legislation that will support them.  Through my role on the House Agriculture Committee, I will advocate for policies that will help meet the needs of our farmers and encourage future generations to follow in their footsteps.

August 31, 2018 
Dear friend,  This week, our nation is laying to rest a hero. Senator John S. McCain, family man, war hero, and friend, passed away after a long life dedicated to serving the American people. It was the honor of a lifetime to have the opportunity to work side-by-side with the Senator during our time together in the nation’s capital. My wife, Sonia, and I send our heartfelt prayers to the McCain family in their time of loss.  McCain’s uncanny courage extended beyond his military service and into the halls of Congress. He was willing to take great risks to fix our broken immigration system. I was fortunate enough to work with him to draft the Uniting and Securing America (USA) Act, an effort to provide a permanent legislative solution for DACA recipients while securing our border. We wanted to ensure that children who were brought here through no fault of their own, who graduated our high schools and live as part of our communities, have the chance to make a life for themselves in this great country.  John McCain believed in America. He had a vision for this country – an America defined by optimism and hope, looking forward to a brighter tomorrow. He fought hard to fulfill that vision, and I am eternally grateful that I was able to play a small part in his incredible journey. His passionate belief in the American ideal will continue to serve as an inspiration for generations. 
￼ 
Fighting back against the opioid epidemic Today is International Drug Overdose Awareness Day and, tragically, the national opioid crisis continues to make bigger inroads in the Central Valley. Nationwide, an estimated 49,068 Americans died from opioid overdoses last year, and an estimated 4,654 Californians died of an opioid overdose in 2016. Congress needs to act quickly to stop this epidemic in its tracks, which is why Congress has dedicated more than $89 million to support prevention, treatment and recovery services in California alone. Over the past few months, I have supported more than 50 pieces of legislation to fight the rapid growth of this crisis, including the Stop the Importation and Trafficking of Synthetic Analogues (SITSA) Act. In the past, drug traffickers have worked around anti-narcotics laws by taking drugs that are already banned and slightly modifying their molecular structure, then selling them on the open market. SITSA closes that loophole, and gets dangerous synthetic opioids off the streets. By taking proactive steps like these to protect our communities from dangerous, addictive drugs, we can make a real difference in the lives of thousands. I will continue to work with my peers in Congress to do everything in our power to put an end to this epidemic.

8/31/18 17:12,Rep. Grothman Newsletter- Weather Conditions in the District,"￼ 
  

Storms in the District
Severe weather conditions including flooding, storms and tornadoes have swept across Southern Wisconsin causing damage to a number of communities in the 6th district. Several tornadoes hit Fond du Lac county, along with other counties in the district such as Marquette, Green Lake and Sheboygan. 

These storms have caused significant damage and have posed a challenge to a large portion of residents in the district and throughout many areas of the state. In order to address the burdensome impact of the storms and provide relief to Wisconsinites, I along with Senator Baldwin and Representative Kind have sent a letter to the President urging him to approve federal assistance for the affected communities. 

Many people throughout Wisconsin are suffering because of these severe weather conditions. I will continue to stand by the communities that have been impacted and offer my full support.   

Great news for Lakeshore Tech
Last month, I had the pleasure of hosting Dr. Paul Carlsen, President of Lakeshore Technical School, in Washington D.C. to testify before the Education and Workforce Committee as part of the Innovation Forum and Showcase.

This week, Washington Monthly released their 2018 College Guide and Rankings and ranked Lakeshore Technical College 3rd out of two year schools for adult learners in the country, up from 11th the previous year. This is an incredible accomplishment for Lakeshore Tech and I am very proud to have such an innovative and renowned institution in the 6th district. 

Lakeshore Tech is a great example of a school that promotes Career and Technical Education and creates pathways for adults to employment. I look forward to continuing to hear about the positive impact institutions such as Lakeshore Tech have.

August 31, 2018
Labor Day
You may be familiar with the union bumper-sticker:  American Labor, the People who brought you the Weekend. It’s a good time to remember this historic truth and the many accomplishments of organized labor in the United States as well as in other democratic countries. It’s important too that we renew our commitment to the unfinished business of social and economic equality.  The forty-hour week, workers’ compensation, overtime wages, paid vacation and sick-time, occupational health and safety standards, all these we owe to unions.  
And these victories came at great cost: strikers were beaten and sometimes killed. There were assassination attempts on union leaders.  Before the passage, in 1935 of the “Wagner Act” named for its sponsor, the great Sen Robert Wagner of New York,  organizers could be fired with no recourse.  In the United States, unions introduced generations of immigrants to civic life and promoted solidarity among newcomers. In mines and in factories, immigrants from all over the world recognized all they had in common and worked in solidarity.  Unions brought dignity, too. Young women who had been persecuted in Tsarist Russia, created the ILGWU, the International Ladies Garment Workers’ Union.  A. Philip Randolph organized the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters in 1925, the first predominantly African-American union. Randolph influenced President Roosevelt to issue an Executive Order in 1941, banning discrimination in defense industries, and convinced President Truman to end segregation in the armed forces.  Both the ILGWU and the Pullman Porters resisted fears that immigrants would take American jobs and joined Eleanor Roosevelt in urging generous refugee policies after World War II.
Recent years have seen a decline in industrial unions even though much remains to be done:   the $15/hour national minimum wage, paid family leave, affordable child care, and, during this Administration, defending the right to organize, OSHA inspections, and protecting all the other progress made in the last century.  We should celebrate Labor Day, conscious of both our history and our future.
Ukrainian Independence Day
￼
Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union on August 24, 1991.  It was my privilege to join Ukrainian Consul Denys Semenovych, local officials, and a group of proud Ukrainian-Americans for a flag raising on City Hall Plaza.  Consul Semenovych, who is based in New York, spoke of his love for Boston and our revolutionary past. I spoke of my trip to Ukraine and my admiration for the people whom I met there.  The newly independent state faces serious problems.   Russia has occupied the Crimean Peninsula and still controls lands within Ukraine’s eastern border.  Despite these challenges and provocations, the country is relatively stable and, according to U.S. Department of State Human Rights reports, both international and domestic observers judged the 2014 presidential and legislative elections free and fair.   I thought, as I often do, about the two oceans that protected our democracy in its formative years.
Massachusetts Alliance of HUD Tenants
I spent some time recently at the annual Massachusetts Alliance of HUD Tenants summer cookout, talking with MAHT members. They all expressed worry about the future of affordable housing and federal funding for community organizing, a concern that I share deeply. It is no secret that this Administration neither understands nor appreciates the importance of housing or the essential role organizers play.  Despite our shared concerns related to the current Administration, I appreciated their invitation and look forward to my continued work with them.
Upham’s Corner Adult Day Care  
I visited an Adult Day Care facility, part of the Upham’s Corner Community Health Center.  CHCs provide essential medical services to both urban and rural neighborhoods.  Upham’s Corner provides services under the Program for All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE).  I met clients and staff, including two physicians who told me how much they had learned about the practice of medicine by making home visits.  PACE serves not just the medical needs of the elderly but also the needs of their family caregivers.  Programs like adult day care offer companionship, activities, and healthy meals to elders and precious respite time for those caring for them at home.  I engaged in a lively exchange with program participants and staff.  As are so many others, they were very concerned about the future of Medicaid and Medicare, as well as that of affordable housing.    
Remembering Ambassador Princeton Lyman 
￼
Ambassador Princeton Lyman, a distinguished career diplomat died last week.  He devoted his life to defending democracy and promoting peace.  He was our Ambassador to South Africa and a friend of Nelson Mandela when apartheid ended and majority rule was achieved.   He convinced U.S. policy makers that the transition could be peaceful and helped direct American influence as well as economic and political assistance to help avert civil war. He knew sub-Saharan Africa better, perhaps, than any other American diplomat:  he had served as director of the U.S. Agency for International Development (US AID) in Ethiopia and as Ambassador to Nigeria
I was privileged to work with him when he served as Special Envoy for Sudan and South Sudan from 2011-2013, appointed by President Obama.  The Darfur genocide and frequent Northern incursions into the South convinced many of us that the government in Khartoum ought not to control all of Sudan.   A referendum confirmed the wish of the people of South Sudan to become an independent nation and the new state was proclaimed in July 2011.   All did not go smoothly.  Ambassador Lyman read all the factions shrewdly, and he was not afraid to deliver tough messages to warring parties, urging them to find non-violent solutions to the issues that divided them.  He and I were profoundly saddened that South Sudan has not been able, in its early years, to achieve stable democracy.   I was always grateful for his insight, his candor, and his intellectual and moral courage.  
Behind the Curtain – More House and Trump Administration Actions You Don’t Want to Miss
Here are this week’s additions. If you need to catch up or share with friends, you can find the full list here.
349:     According to an August 2018 NY Times report, the CFPB will no longer supervise compliance with the Military Lending Act, other than to respond to complaints if and when they come in.  Active service military members are some of those most preyed upon by unscrupulous lenders. They deserve better than lax enforcement and weak oversight. This new policy is a drastic change from the previous Administration’s attitude towards consumers and renders hollow this Administration’s professed support for the military.  
350:     According to an August 2018 Washington Post report, ICE is arresting unsuspecting immigrants who attend meetings in government offices on their path towards legal permanent residency.  We should be encouraging, not discouraging, those who are trying to obtain legal residency.  I joined all 9 members of the Massachusetts Congressional delegation in urging the Department of Homeland Security to immediately halt the practice.
351:     According to an August 27, 2018 report from Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Washington, the Trump administration is on pace to increase its promotion of the President’s business compared to the first year of Trump in office.  They documented 54 public references to Trump brands, including references inserted in the middle of completely unrelated remarks.  Trump refused to divest his companies and is now using his public office to promote them.
352:     The Washington Post reported in early August on a lawsuit filed against the Trump Administration on behalf of children separated at the border. The judge in the case ordered the Administration to stop drugging the captive children with psychotropic medications without the knowledge and consent of their parents or without a court order. The federal district court judge, Dolly Gee, cited testimony from the children explaining how they were required to take medication every morning and night, including in some cases being forcibly injected, or threatened with indefinite detention.

Remembering John McCain
John McCain was an American patriot, dedicated to our constitution and the ideals it represents. His courage as a POW in the Hanoi Hilton will be long remembered. America has lost a dedicated and loyal son. May he rest in peace.
Before his passing, John McCain penned a farewell statement to the nation. His final sentiments to the American public highlight some of the most pressing issues facing our country. Chief among them is our society's increasingly polarized political discourse that is causing dangerous and visceral divides to form. By focusing on achieving shared goals and serving causes greater than ourselves, we can heal this divisiveness and improve our future.
Read John McCain’s farewell statement here: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/27/us/politics/john-mccain-farewell-statement.html?emc=edit_nn_20180828&nl=morning-briefing&nlid=6629672920180828&te=1

Honoring the Life and Service of Columbia Co. Veteran
Our Upstate New York communities are home to many brave men and women who have risked life and limb to protect our freedoms. On Monday, I attended the Columbia County Honor-A-Vet ceremony, remembering the life and honoring the dedicated service of Murray Winn Rathbun. 
Born in Troy, Murray attended the Berlin Central School District and later served in the United States Marine Corps. Through his honorable and courageous service in Vietnam, he was awarded the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry, the Vietnam Service Medal, the Vietnam Campaign Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Good Conduct Medal and the Rifle Expert Badge.  
It was a pleasure to meet his family and honor his legacy.

International Trade Commission Blocks Newsprint Tariffs
I applaud the International Trade Commission’s (ITC) decision to block tariffs on newsprint. The reversal of these harmful tariffs is good for the people of Upstate New York and the hardworking employees of local newspapers.
From the Daily Freeman in the Hudson Valley to the Daily Star in Oneonta, Upstate New Yorkers depend on local newspapers to know what is going on in their communities. The tariffs on newsprint threatened to cause irreversible damage to local newspapers, which already operate under thin margins.
In response to the administration’s proposed tariffs on newsprint, I joined four other members in sending a bipartisan letter to the Department of Commerce and the ITC to express our concerns about the tariffs. Additionally, I became a cosponsor of H.R. 6031 - the PRINT Act. This legislation would require the Department of Commerce to study how possible tariffs would impact the vitality of the newsprint industry and the local newspaper publishing industry before any tariffs could be implemented. 
Read the letter my colleagues and I sent here: https://faso.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Newsprint-Letter-002.pdf
And, read more about the ITC’s decision here: http://www.dailyfreeman.com/general-news/20180829/newsprint-tariffs-killed-by-us-international-trade-commission-schumer-faso-cheer-decision

Schoharie County’s LEAD Approach to Crime
“If we can get somebody when they’re still committing a low-level offense, get them the help they need and solve the problem, then it will never get to the point of being violent.” This is Schoharie County’s new approach to dealing with low-level crimes that are often the result of a larger problem, such as drug abuse or mental illness.
Schoharie County has adopted Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD), a community-based diversion program to help law enforcement address crime while also assisting our community’s most vulnerable members. The LEAD program diverts these low-level, non-violent offenders to a case manager and social services system, as opposed to simply arresting them. It's great to see Schoharie County taking the lead and becoming the 2nd community in New York to adopt this approach.
Read more about the LEAD program in Schoharie County here:  https://cbs6albany.com/news/local/schoharie-county-to-implement-lead-approach

Meeting with Representatives from the Alzheimer’s Association
The Alzheimer’s Association is the nation’s leading voluntary health organization whose mission is to eradicate Alzheimer’s through the advancement of research, reduce the risk of dementia, and provide care and support to the many battling this life-altering disease. 
It was a pleasure to meet with Ian Magerkuth and Bill Hinrichs of the Alzheimer’s Association this week at my Kinderhook District Office. We discussed federal funding for research into Alzheimer’s, as well as the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer’s Act, legislation that I have cosponsored. With more than 5 million Americans currently living with Alzheimer’s, I fully support robust medical research funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other Alzheimer’s-related initiatives.

Working to Improve Rural Broadband
There is a critical lack of broadband infrastructure throughout Upstate New York. We all know too well the inconsistent cell service and the slow internet connection that plagues many of our rural Upstate communities. In the 21st Century, reliable broadband is essential to stimulate local economies, increase educational opportunities, and raise the overall quality of life for New Yorkers. 
On Wednesday, I hosted a meeting at SUNY Cobleskill with leaders and representatives of local broadband providers to discuss the Rural Utilities Services’ (RUS) e-Connectivity Pilot Program. This initiative, which was included in the March budget legislation, is a $600 million federal grant program specifically targeted to expand rural broadband infrastructure.
The RUS is asking for feedback from a wide range of stakeholders as they develop this pilot program. I intend on submitting a comment on the program’s development with input from members of our district’s telecommunication industry. 
Read more about my meeting here: http://www.thedailystar.com/news/local_news/faso-telecom-leaders-talk-broadband-expansion/article_a6e69b3d-ace8-59f7-ab9f-6d252f0af784.html

Visit to FastSigns in Kingston
On Wednesday, I visited FastSigns in Kingston to meet with local business owners and employees. It was great to visit the facility and discuss a wide range of issues, including H.R. 3441, the Save Local Businesses Act, a bill I supported when it came to the House floor for a vote.  
New York State has one of the worst business climates in the country. High taxes, combined with a murky regulatory environment, are causing businesses and families to flee our state at alarming rates. I remain committed to alleviating these burdens our job creators face while also supporting our dedicated Upstate New York employees.

Needed Reforms to our Agricultural Guestworker System
From dairy farms to apple orchards, agriculture is the engine of our local economies in Upstate New York. Unfortunately, our agricultural guestworker program is overly complex and places a burden on local farmers who rely heavily on it to harvest their crops.  
To address this issue, I joined with colleagues from both sides of the aisle to introduce H.R. 6417, the AG and Legal Workforce Act. This bipartisan legislation would replace the current H-2A program with a new, more efficient program called H-2C to provide a steady supply of labor and make significant reforms to the current agricultural guestworker program to ensure we have a safe and legal workforce. 
Read more about this legislation and the importance of agricultural guestworkers to our Upstate farming operations here: http://www.dailyfreeman.com/article/DF/20180824/NEWS/180829851

Generic EpiPen Could Reduce Risk of Life-Threatening Shortages
EpiPen shortages are still popping up across the country. Unfortunately, these shortages coincide with the beginning of the school year when demand for this medication is the highest. The limited availability of EpiPens leaves many children who suffer from severe allergies vulnerable, and for some, it may present a life or death situation.  
In May, I wrote to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking input on how we can bring an end to the current shortage and help prevent future ones: https://bit.ly/2wfyCVA. I am glad to see the FDA approve of a generic version of the EpiPen. 
Read more about the dangerous shortage of EpiPens throughout the country in the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/health/epipen-generic-drug-prices.html

The Dangers of Synthetic Opioids 
“The increased risk of death related to fentanyl is what’s driving this epidemic.”
The synthetic drug fentanyl has emerged as a more common evil in our communities and is now increasingly being cut into other drugs such as cocaine. It's indistinguishable from heroin in appearance but can be over fifty times as potent.
We need to continue to intensify our fight against fentanyl and other drugs that are bringing pain to our communities. The best way is to stop it in its tracks before it even gets here. The STOP Act, which has passed the House and awaits action in the Senate, would utilize advanced tracking data to identify packages shipped through the U.S. Postal service that may contain synthetic drugs.
Read more about these deadly synthetic drugs in the Boston Globe: https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/08/24/with-fentanyl-flooding-illicit-market-all-drug-users-now-danger/GCYjSAKx0Q6m4hOL3T3eGJ/story.html?p1=BGHeader_SmartBar_Breaking?p1=BGHeader_SmartBar_Breaking?s_campaign=breakingnews:newsletter

Dear Jenni,  
On Monday, I led a bipartisan call demanding a hearing and action to resolve the Department of Veterans Affairs’ apparent inability to properly review the cases of veterans who sought help for Military Sexual Trauma. In an environment where survivors often refuse to report sexual assaults for fear of retaliation, the VA’s failure to fairly treat these claims risks revictimizing survivors. I implore the VA to instill confidence for survivors by immediately working to resolve these issues.
The proposed changes to Title IX reported in the New York Times this week are deeply concerning. The ability to feel safe from sexual violence and sexual harassment on campus is an integral part of the pursuit of an education. Sadly, these changes reportedly being considered by the Trump Administration take us in the wrong direction and will undermine protections for students. These reported proposals would not only make it harder for survivors to pursue justice and accountability but also undermine efforts to stop sexual violence and harassment at colleges across the country. Our students deserve better and I will continue to stand against efforts by Secretary DeVos and the Trump Administration to weaken protections for students.

Meeting with hospital leadership at Monadnock Community Hospital 
Expanding Access to Healthcare and Substance Misuse Treatment   
On Wednesday, I met with hospital leadership at Monadnock Community Hospital to hear about their efforts to increase access to healthcare and substance misuse treatment in New Hampshire’s rural communities. We had a candid conversation about the challenges facing the Monadnock region including the opioid epidemic, behavioral health issues, and efforts to bolster our healthcare workforce. If we can foster partnerships with healthcare providers and education centers to help train the healthcare workforce of the future, it will support the local economy and strengthen our efforts to combat the opioid crisis.
Pursuing Smart Trade Policies  
I’m encouraged by the unanimous decision of the International Trade Commission 5-0 to overturn tariffs on Canadian groundwood paper, which has strained industries that rely on paper products such as newspapers and publishing. We need to support industries that are central to our democracy, including the free press and publishers. On Wednesday in Dublin, I heard about the burden these tariffs have placed on Yankee Publishing and I urge President Trump to consider the impact on small businesses and workers before charging into trade disputes.
New Hampshire’s New U.S. Marshal  
I want to congratulate former Manchester Police Chief Nick Willard on his confirmation as U.S. Marshal for our great state. Chief Willard’s experience as the Police Chief in Manchester and his dedicated work to tackle the opioid epidemic make him the right person for this job. I look forward to supporting his work to protect Granite State families and communities.
Serving You  
As your Representative, my most important job is supporting Granite Staters when they need help with federal agencies. I was recently contacted by Raymond Castonguay of Antrim, who had an issue of concern with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). My staff worked with the DOT and helped resolve Raymond’s concern. If my office may be of assistance with a problem you are experiencing, please don’t hesitate to reach out to my staff at 603-226-1002 so we can learn how we may help. 
Thank you as always for everything you do to make our state such a wonderful place to live. I hope you have a great long weekend!

This Week in the Office of Senator Marco Rubio 
John McCain’s sacrifices to his country are immeasurable. With his passing , America has lost more than a leader and more than a senator. We have lost a true American hero. As a colleague in the Senate and a friend, I drew personal inspiration from his leadership, intellect and moral courage. He set the standard for what we should expect from our soldiers and from our public servants of all levels. In this time of grief, I hope John’s family finds comfort in knowing that this extraordinary man touched countless lives, and his memory will continue to set the standard of leadership and moral resolve for future generations.

In Case You Missed It...
“A recurring memory has stayed with me throughout my life. It is the late-night sound of my father limping tiredly up the steps to our house after working another wedding or bar mitzvah, keys jingling until he could find the right one to unlock the front door. The memory is a reminder of the sacrifices he made for our family and a source of motivation for me to follow his example for my own family today. My father worked as a bartender, and my mother was a maid. And yet the jobs my parents worked provided for a family. Stable employment, even in my father’s service-sector work, paid well enough for my mother to consider staying at home by the time my younger sister was born. They had enough to own a home, raise three kids, and even help send me to college.” (Home Economics: Building an Economy to Strengthen Families, American Greatness, 8/31/2018)

Dear Friends, 

I hope you are all enjoying the end of summer. I have had a productive District Work period back in Kentucky. Though I spent some time doing my civic duty and serving on a grand jury this month, I was also glad to meet with many different Second District residents about issues that are facing the Commonwealth and the nation. 

As vice chair of the Health Subcommittee and chairman of the Higher Education and Workforce Development Subcommittee, I have worked with my colleagues to address the opioid epidemic. My bill to help those suffering from opioid use disorder recover and reenter the workforce, the Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers Act, passed the House in June along with dozens of other bills to combat the opioid crisis. 

This month I had the opportunity to meet with many Kentuckians who have been affected by the opioid crisis and with organizations devoted to helping people with opioid use disorder. As Congress continues to address this important issue, I will be taking the feedback I received this month back to my committees so that we can do more to help the Commonwealth recover from the opioid epidemic. 

￼
I met with advocates from Addiction Policy Forum to hear from them about what more Congress can do to support people with opioid use disorder. 

I also visited with different companies and organizations in the Second District that are trying to help Kentuckians get jobs. As our economy continues to grow, one of my top priorities is helping people learn the skills they need for the jobs that are available. Next week, I will be chairing a hearing on how Congress can support apprenticeships as a way for people to learn skills while earning a living. Earlier this summer I introduced the APPRENTICE Act, which will expand apprenticeship opportunities. 


￼
I enjoyed visiting the new Industry Innovation Center at Owensboro Community and Technical College to see what they're doing to help students learn valuable skills. 

Below are some more photos of this District Work period. I hope you all enjoy Labor Day weekend. 


Sincerely,

This Week: Honoring the Life of Senator John McCain

Last Saturday, the nation lost a man who embodied what it means to be an American patriot. From his service in the Navy to his years in Congress, John always fought for our country with honor and distinction. As a colleague, I deeply appreciated his willingness to look for common ground -- and the determination and humor always sparkling in John’s eyes.  
￼

Through his campaigns, New Hampshire had a special chance to get to know John. He was respected across the political spectrum, and we were proud to consider him an honorary Granite Stater.  
I still remember a Veterans Day ceremony at the New Hampshire State Veterans Cemetery about ten years ago. John was a guest, and as he was saying hello to people, I told him that Veterans Day has always been special and emotional to me because my dad was a WWII Veteran.   
And he just stopped everything right there to talk to me about my father. In that moment, you saw what made John McCain truly so special – his deep understanding about what binds us all together as Americans. 
He served our country with such great bravery and distinction, in horrible conditions, and then came home and showed us what it means to put country first. To love each other as Americans, even though we may disagree. I am going to miss him terribly, his was an example that we should all strive to follow. 
The Trump Administration's junk insurance plans won't have to cover people with pre-existing conditions such as cancer, diabetes, or asthma. That isn't right. I'm joining my colleagues in forcing a vote to stop this attempt to sabotage people’s health care. 
￼ 
Watch my video here to learn more about this attempt at health care sabotage. 
I am also proud that the full Senate has confirmed Nick Willard to serve as the next U.S. Marshal for New Hampshire this week. 
He has dedicated his career to keeping our communities safe and I am confident that he will serve the people of New Hampshire with the same distinction that he showed as Manchester Police Chief. I look forward to continuing to work with him to address the challenges that our state faces, including the devastating opioid crisis, and to ensure that our state and country are safe, secure, and free. 
This week, I continued to highlight the stories of Granite Staters who have told their personal health care stories. 
You can watch Dennis’s and Lynnette’s stories on my Instagram here. I won’t stop fighting for protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

8/31/18 16:03,Mourning a beloved patriot.,"￼
Today in the Capitol rotunda we paid tribute to an American hero, a powerful leader, and a dear friend: Senator John McCain. After decades of dedicated service to this nation, John was taken from us over the weekend. The good senator from Arizona fought his battle with brain cancer as he did every battle in his life — with toughness and tenacity, with grit and grace.
￼ 
I consider myself incredibly lucky to have known John, and even luckier to have called him a friend. 
A lifetime of selfless service, John came to embody the very pinnacle of American virtue. Courage, commitment, integrity, and sacrifice: these are the precepts he lived by and by which he will always be remembered. No one is more worthy of the word hero than John McCain. The Senate—indeed, the nation—will miss the steady, guiding presence of a singular statesman.
John constantly put others before himself as a prisoner of war, and he did the same as a Senator. He was the kind of friend you could count on for help when you needed it most. Nearly 20 years ago, Governor Mitt Romney—who at the time, had been tasked with salvaging the Salt Lake Winter Olympic Games—came to me with a pressing problem: with only months to go before the opening ceremony, Utah lacked the federal funding it desperately needed to pull off the Olympic Games. 
In our moment of need, we turned to Senator McCain. The two of us marched up to Senator McCain’s office in the Russell Building. Even though we came unannounced, Senator McCain gladly received us, and together, Mitt and I made the case for emergency funding. Within days, we had secured the resources we needed to move forward with the Games—all thanks to Senator McCain. Were it not for John’s quick action, I can honestly say that the 2002 Winter Olympics would not have been a success.
We will remember John for many things: for his courage as a sailor, for his dedication as a Senator, and for his principle as a statesman. We will also remember how he embodied the best in us. John McCain was a man for all seasons—a voice of temperance in intemperate times, and a model of civility and reason. The tragedy of his passing is that we need men like John McCain now more than ever before.
I consider myself incredibly lucky to have known John, and even luckier to have called him a friend. Here in the Senate and across the nation, we will miss him dearly. My prayers are with the people of Arizona and the McCain family. 
Sincerely,
  ￼ 
Orrin

Long’s Short Report – It’s time for Turkey to start acting like an ally
By Rep. Billy Long
On July 15, 2016, the Turkish military devised a plan to overthrow the Turkish government in order to protest what it thought was an abuse of power by President Erdogan. As it unfolded worldwide, in real time, in front of millions on television, it lasted but a few hours before the coup was defeated. 241 people died and more than 2,000 were injured. Shortly after the failed coup, President Erdogan began arresting countless individuals who either took part in the coup or were suspected of helping those who did, with one of those people being American pastor, Andrew Brunson.  
In October of 2016, Pastor Brunson and his wife were arrested by Turkish officials. At the time, they were given no reason for their arrest. After 13 days, Pastor Brunson’s wife was released, but he was not. According to Turkish officials, Pastor Brunson stood accused of helping those who attempted to overthrow the government as well as of having ties to terrorist organizations. What evidence did the Turkish government have to prove these accusations? None.
While imprisoned, members of Pastor Brunson’s congregation attempted to bring him food and clothing, but were denied. An attorney came to visit Pastor Brunson, but was also denied. U.S. consulate officials requested to meet with Pastor Brunson, but were denied. These actions, some of which violate international treaties, are unacceptable and something the U.S. should not tolerate from a NATO ally.
President Trump, a strong advocate for religious freedom, has been working diligently to free Pastor Brunson. Earlier in August, he imposed financial sanctions on high-level government officials and raised tariffs on metal. This response came after months of Turkey’s continued refusal to release Pastor Brunson.
In July, bipartisan legislation was introduced in the Senate that would restrict international loans to financial institutions in Turkey until the Turkish government releases Pastor Brunson. If passed by both the House of Representatives and Senate, and signed into law by the president, this bill would have major economic impacts on Turkey, given Turkey’s reliance on international loans from both the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation.
It’s time Turkey acts like an ally and releases this good Christian man. His wife and children have gone almost two years without their husband and father.

￼ 
Dear Friend,
If you are a Vietnam War era veteran who served from 1955 through 1975 or if you lost your Vietnam Veteran spouse, I invite you to sign up to be honored at my Vietnam War Veterans Commemoration on:   Tuesday, September 11 at 10:00 AM  MacDill Air Force Base - Davis Conference Center  You can find more information at castor.house.gov or by calling 813-871-2817.  I am proud to serve as a Commemorative Partner to thank and honor the brave men and women in Florida’s 14th Congressional District for their service and sacrifice. Many veterans who served during the Vietnam era were not welcomed home with open arms or given the respect they earned for their service because of the political division over the Vietnam war. No matter one’s beliefs about the war, we should honor those who answered the call of service to their country. At my ceremony at MacDill Air Force Base, each veteran or those who have lost their Vietnam Veteran spouse will receive a commemorative pin and personal thanks – tokens of our country’s appreciation and gratitude for their service and sacrifice.  There is still time to register for this very special ceremony. If you are a Vietnam War era veteran served from 1955 through 1975 or if you have lost your Vietnam Veteran spouse, please find more details at castor.house.gov or call 813-871-2817 – I would love to honor you.

8/31/18 15:58,Revitalizing the Space Coast,"￼ 
Dear Friends, 
Last year the United States once again led the world in space launches - and two-thirds of those launches came from Florida's Space Coast.  
I've been working hard to bring these jobs to Florida and I'm continuing to fight to make sure we have the resources and infrastructure in place to keep the space business growing and flourishing for decades to come.
Our work is paying off - rockets are taking off and landing every few weeks and huge, new industrial complexes are being built to manufacture commercial rockets and satellites just outside of Kennedy Space Center. 
And none of this is by accident.  
I authored the NASA Authorization of 2010 with Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) that set our space program on its current path.  
I joined with Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) to write the follow-on NASA Transition Authorization of 2017 along with the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act of 2015, which enabled continued commercial growth in Florida.  
And I've brought together top leaders at the Air Force, NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to streamline the approval process for commercial launches. Each year, I work with my colleagues on the Armed Services committee to invest in our critical national space launch infrastructure in Florida.  
Just last month, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for 2019. That bill included several amendments I fought for, including: 
	•	Funding to repair the Indian River Bridge, used by the Air Force and NASA to transport space vehicles to the launch-pad. This bridge is in desperate need of replacement to ensure future viability of launch operations.
	•	Directing the Air Force to allow reusable commercial rockets to compete alongside traditional expendable rockets for launch contracts.
	•	Eliminating overlapping Air Force and FAA approval processes for commercial space companies.
All of these reforms will help us get to the goal of two rocket launches in a single day. Supporting NASA and commercial space ensures America's continued leadership in space and also good, high-paying jobs right here in Florida. That's why I will always fight for Florida's Space Coast.  
Sincerely, ￼

Remembering Senator John McCain
As the country continues to mourn the loss of Senator John McCain, a particular Bible verse comes to mind when reflecting upon the honorable legacy he left behind. 
2 Timothy 4:7-8 - I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing. 
Rest In Peace, Senator McCain. You are a hero that served your country faithfully. I hope each of you will join in me in praying for his family and loved ones during this difficult time. 
Update to Second Quarter GDP Growth!
This week, the Commerce Department announced that our economy grew by 4.2 percent in Quarter 2 of this year. 
This is a revision that shows improvement from the first estimate. It goes to show this is still the strongest quarter of growth in FOUR years. Business investments are stronger. Our economy is booming and only getting better. 
The April to June measure represents the first full quarter since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed thanks to President Trump & Congress.

As we wrap up the last week before Congress is back in session, I had the opportunity to visit more businesses and meet with constituents across the district. Here are a few photos from the week:

Fifth District Family Values Watch

Congressman Latta's monthly newsletter tracking life and family news from the Nation’s Capital
Friday, August 31, 2018
For the House of Representatives, the month of August was a district work period which means I was able to be home in Northwest and West Central Ohio to meet in-person with hundreds of constituents.  Although it was a very busy month, I really enjoyed my time seeing businesses, speaking with law enforcement and veterans, and joining all of you at local events, parades, and county fairs.  I had valuable meetings and learned much that I will bring with me to Washington, D.C. to help shape policy that reflect the views and needs of my constituents. 
Please feel free to forward this e-newsletter to share pro-life and pro-family news in your community.  It is my great honor to serve as your Member of Congress and it is my number one priority to represent you and the best interests of the Fifth Congressional District.  Please do not hesitate to call, write, or e-mail me in the future with any of your concerns or questions.  For federal-related issues, you may reach my Washington, D.C. office by phone at (202) 225-6405, or my District office at (800) 541-6446 for constituent services.  I encourage you to visit my website at http://latta.house.gov where you can sign up for my e-newsletter.  Also, feel free to follow me online at www.facebook.com/boblatta/ or on Twitter at @boblatta, which helps bring my work in Washington, D.C. home to you.

Stop Subsidizing Elective Abortion
On August 6th, I joined a letter led by Representative Chris Smith (R-NJ) to Secretary Alex Azar of the Department of Health and Humans Services (HHS) asking for new regulations to enforce the abortion transparency provisions found in section 1303 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or also known as “Obamacare.”  
The Hyde amendment, which prohibits federal funding for abortion or insurance plans that include abortion, does not apply to Obamacare.  Instead, the ACA directly permits government subsidies to fund insurance plans that cover abortion.  Section 1303 set up a payment scheme requiring insurers to collect a separate payment from each enrollee in any plan containing abortion. The separate payment was to be deposited into a separate account and serve as the funding mechanism for elective abortions.  However, section 1303 has never been enforced. 
The U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, in 2017 to statutorily address Obamacare’s abortion funding.  However, until H.R. 7 is enacted into law, the Administration can issue new regulations that enforce Section 1303.  Therefore, the letter sent to HHS Secretary Azar asks the agency to issue new regulations that align with the clear meaning of Section 1303 and its requirement for a separate payment and provide ample mechanisms for enforcement.
I have never supported and will never support the use of taxpayer dollars for abortion.  This letter is another effort by pro-life conservatives to keep federal subsidies out of elective abortion coverage in health insurance plans on the Obamacare exchanges.  I hope this letter encourages the Administration to act on properly enforcing the law and keep taxpayer dollars from funding elective abortion.  
Amicus Brief Supporting America’s Heroes 
In late July, I joined an amicus brief led by Representative Steve Scalise (R-LA) in defense of the Bladensburg World War I Memorial honoring our fallen soldiers.  The American Humanist Association filed suit alleging that the 93-year-old cross-shaped memorial in Prince George’s County, Maryland was unconstitutional.  The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the memorial due to the inherent meaning of the cross as religious symbol.  The amicus brief, which is in support of the American Legion’s petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS), argues: (1) the circuit court decision ignores court rulings allowing prominent displays of religious symbols and the long history of the Establishment Clause promoting neutrality not hostility towards religion; and (2) the circuit court decision imperils countless monuments, historic places, and national traditions, including those at Arlington National Cemetery and the U.S. Capitol Building. 
Our country has a longstanding tradition to remember and celebrate our fallen soldiers by erecting memorials and monuments, which often incorporate religious symbols.  I believe it is important to uphold religious freedom and honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation by protecting memorials like the Bladensburg World War I Memorial.  
 Family Planning Grantees Include Planned Parenthood
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently announced the names of 96 Title X family planning grantees for fiscal year 2018, which include several Planned Parenthood affiliates.  There are three grantees in Ohio – the Ohio Department of Health, Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, and Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region. 
The Title X program serves more than 4 million family planning clients, most of whom are low-income women.  The program provides care for family planning and related preventative health services, such as contraception, pregnancy testing and counseling, sexually transmitted disease screening and treatment, and breast and cervical cancer screening.  However, Title X prohibits funds from being used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning. 
The current Title X regulations, put into place during the Clinton Administration, require grantees to refer for abortion and permit colocation of abortion clinics and Title X clinics within the same facility.  However, the current Administration proposed a rule to amend the Clinton-era regulations in June of this year.  The proposed rule would separate abortion from family planning.  I, along with over 140 other Members of Congress, submitted a letter to HHS in support of the modifications made by the proposed rule.  The comment period has ended, and HHS is reviewing over 200,000 submitted comments before the rule can be finalized and put into effect.  If the proposed rule is finalized as is, existing grantees (including Planned Parenthood) would have 60 days to come into compliance with the prohibition on abortion referral and requirement to financially separate from abortion activities, and one year to comply with the requirement for physical separation from abortion activities.

Dear Friend, 
The decisions that the next Supreme Court Justice will help shape will impact the lives of all Americans in countless ways. As your Senator, and in particular, as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, it is my job to thoroughly evaluate President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, and fully understand how his confirmation could impact Delawareans.
Since he was nominated for this important position on July 9th,  I have been working hard to study his record and learn more about his judicial philosophy.  A couple of weeks ago, we had a private meeting in my office, and next week, in the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will have the opportunity to question Judge Kavanaugh in public hearings. I will also have an opportunity to send Judge Kavanaugh questions to answer in writing.
I have several concerns about Judge Kavanaugh’s record and his interpretation of the Constitution, but I also want to hear your thoughts, your concerns, and your input.  Please visit www.coons.senate.gov/kavanaugh to tell me what you think of Judge Kavanaugh and what you want me to consider as I evaluate his nomination.
Thanks for subscribing to my newsletter – and please keep in touch to let me know how I can help your family and your community. I’d love to hear from you. I hope you’ll send me an email or give my office a call.
Sincerely,
￼

News from Representative Bustos 
￼

Dear Lindsey, 
￼
Congresswoman Bustos’ “Cheri on Shift” at Gold Star in Aledo, Illinois 
During the month of August, I held my annual 21st Century Heartland Tour in which I traveled around Northwest and Central Illinois focusing on the unique challenges facing rural communities and ways to grow our local economy. From visiting local libraries to touring family farms, I traveled over 2,400 miles and held more than 20 events. I hosted multiple roundtable discussions with farmers from across the region and met with Illinois’ major commodity groups to hear how they have been impacted by President Trump’s trade war. I also worked alongside the men and women of the district by hosting “Cheri on Shifts” at Gold Star, Pacific Ethanol and Consolidated Grain and Barge amongst other local companies in Illinois’ agricultural economy.
These events allowed me to hear directly from those involved in the agricultural economy as I prepare to help negotiate the 2018 Farm Bill, a critical piece of legislation to the small towns and rural communities across our region. When I return to Washington, I’ll be sitting down with my colleagues in both the House and Senate to continue our work on the final version of the 2018 Farm Bill. As a member of the Conference Committee, it is my goal to ensure a Farm Bill that strengthens rural communities and puts food on the tables of families across the region and nation. After hearing directly from so many of you in the agricultural economy, I’m excited to bring your concerns back to Washington, giving you a seat at the table with me. Click here to read more about the Farm Bill. 
As I traveled the region and asked folks what was on their mind, there was one consistent concern outside of the Farm Bill; tariffs. President Trump’s trade war has had a very real impact on family farmers across Illinois as our markets shrink and commodity prices continue to plunge. That’s why I am proud to announce new legislation that directs funds the government is collecting from tariffs on imported goods toward trade promotion assistance to help open new markets for farmers hurt by the trade war. Read more about this bill here. 
To keep up on the work that I am doing to fight for the hardworking families of Illinois, make sure to stay connected with me @RepCheri!

The Hill Report   A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions Week of August 27 - August 31, 2018
Today, I join a grateful nation in honoring the life of U.S. Senator John McCain, a true American hero. His service to our country will never be forgotten. Please join me in taking a moment to pause and reflect on this patriot.   As the August state work period comes to a close, I am thankful for the opportunity I had to hear from folks across our community and sit down with them face-to-face to learn more about the issues most important to North Texans. From manufacturing facilities to small businesses to community groups, I have appreciated the chance to participate in almost 80 official events just this month. I look forward to bringing each of your thoughts and ideas back with me and translating them into action in Washington.   Monday, we recognize the diligent American workforce and all your contributions to our nation. From main street to the manufacturing line, each and every worker makes an incredible impact on the prosperity of our country. Thank you, for all that you do and have a happy and safe Labor Day. 
Meetings in the District 
Meeting with Secretary Perry This week, Secretary Perry and I were able to sit down with local leaders to have a productive and free-flowing discussion on regulations impacting the energy industry and how emerging markets, like China and India, will impact the U.S. As America’s leading energy producer, Texas sets the pace for our nation’s efforts to become energy independent. I look forward to continuing to work closely with the Secretary and our energy producers to support our oil, gas, and alternative energy fields and advance efforts to ensure our continued leadership and economic security. Read more on this productive discussion here.

Mothers Advocating Medical Marijuana for Autism (MAMMA)  Over the past few months, I have had the distinct honor to work with three remarkable mothers who work tirelessly every day to advocate for their children as a part of the national organization, Mothers Advocating Medical Marijuana for Autism (MAMMA). As parents of children with disabilities, our conversations have centered around how we can best work together to find solutions for our children to help improve their quality of life when nothing seems to help.   I was pleased to get to continue our conversations together in my Dallas office on Monday because I believe that by working together, real progress can be made. I look forward to continuing my journey with parents like Amy, Thalia and Mayra as we look to find the best solutions for our children.

 Faith Community Roundtable on Mental Health   This week I led an important roundtable discussion about mental illness and suicide prevention with various faith leaders from across North Texas.  Experts from the Veterans Resource Center as well as counselors from Highland Park High School joined us to discuss practices that work within their communities.  Mental illness and suicide are national issues that impact everyone and I am pleased we could bring together important community figures to address this critical issue and save lives.

PepsiCo.  On Tuesday, I had the privilege of joining my friends at PepsiCo. headquarters. During our tour of the facility, I was able to see firsthand how Frito-Lay products come to life.  Following the tour I participated in a productive roundtable discussion with community leaders and business members hosted by the National Association of Manufacturers.  They informed me how the reinvestments in their companies made possible by the Tax Cut and Jobs Act are impacting their business operations.  I am proud that Republicans in Congress were able to come together to pass such vital legislation that allows American businesses to not just succeed, but thrive.

 State Farm   This week, I was delighted to visit the Richardson offices of State Farm, an insurance company with over 65,000 employees, many of whom live in our congressional district. As a leading-edge company with a variety of product offerings, the company shared their views on federal policies related to automated vehicle technology, the National Flood Insurance Program, and insurance generally. In addition to discussions with leadership, I had the pleasure of meeting with employees to hear their concerns. I look forward to visiting their offices again in the future.

 Birth Choice of Dallas  This week I was delighted to meet with leaders of the pro-life community in North Texas to ensure we as a nation cultivate a culture that values all life. As a father, I believe life is precious at all stages and should never be undermined because it is considered inconvenient or unwanted. Throughout my time in Congress, I have actively engaged in efforts to protect the unborn as Chairman of the House Rules Committee, in speeches on the House Floor, and through my support for legislation to advance the pro-life cause. As your Congressman, I will always support the sanctity of life and believe that every effort should be made to protect and honor life.

Op-ed: Tax Reform Works for Michigan

Jack Bergman joined Mike Bishop, Bill Huizenga, Fred Upton, Tim Walberg, Dave Trott, Paul Mitchell and John Moolenaar to discuss the benefits to Michigan from recent tax reform and workforce development legislation.  Click HERE for Link to Article.  Next week, our country honors the men and women who work hard every day to provide for their families and get the job done. Also, across the state, families are sending students back to school to pursue another year of education that will help them develop the knowledge and skills needed to secure a job following graduation. That’s why we have supported legislation that lets hardworking Michiganders keep more of their own money and empowered new learning opportunities for students.
Right now, unemployment is near historic lows; the economy is strong and providing opportunities for all. Here in Michigan, we know a good comeback and we also know that a booming economy doesn’t just happen on its own - it comes as a result of implementing sound policies that benefit families.
With the overhaul of our outdated tax code, employers have announced raises, made new investments, and expanded employee benefits. Employees have kept more of their own money, benefiting from the lower tax rates that were implemented in February. All of this means more money in the pockets of hardworking Michigan residents and that is always a good thing.
The new tax law also established Opportunity Zones, to spur redevelopment and bring jobs into underserved areas. It has been more than 10 years since the start of the Great Recession, but many communities are still on the road to recovery. This new community development program will encourage long-term investment in low-income and rural communities by providing a tax incentive for investors. The IRS designated 288 qualifying Opportunity Zones in Michigan, and they have a unique and exciting potential to attract investment and grow existing industry sectors across our state.
For parents, there will be even more benefits from tax reform, when they claim the new, doubled Child Tax Credit. This $2,000 per child credit will help families save more on their taxes and the extra money will go a long way. When we hear from families they tell us the extra money will help them pay for clothing, bills, and diapers. We also know a lot of families are living paycheck-to-paycheck and this extra money will help them with unexpected expenses like an emergency car repair.
Despite all of these positive outcomes and optimism, our work is not done. We now have a situation in our country where there are more open jobs than there are job seekers. While this may seem like a good problem to have, it’s critical to close the skills gap and ensure students are connected with the training they need to enter our workforce.
That’s why we joined to pass bipartisan legislation, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act that invests over $7.5 billion in career and technical education.  President Trump signed this legislation into law last month, marking a strong step in the right direction to help individuals achieve the American dream and find fulfilling work.
We believe that tomorrow’s good-paying jobs will come from the freedom to innovate from the ground up – from our local communities and small businesses, not Washington. And we are committed to building on our progress to make sure families across our nation have confidence in the future and every opportunity to succeed. 
Jack Bergman, Mike Bishop, Bill Huizenga, Fred Upton, Tim Walberg, Dave Trott, Paul Mitchell and John Moolenaar are Republican U.S. congressmen from Michigan.

August 31, 2018 
Dear Friend,  
It continues to be a great honor to serve and represent you in the U.S. Senate. Last week was a busy week and the following is a brief update on just some of the issues I’ve been working on.  
￼ 
A True American Hero 
  
￼
I’m heartbroken by the passing of my friend and colleague, Senator John McCain. John faced his battle with cancer the same way he faced all challenges in his life – with profound strength and determination. Senator McCain was a titan in the Senate who understood the indispensable role this institution plays in leading the nation. While we didn't always agree, John believed in spirited and principled debates, and the importance of putting country ahead of party. He was a patriot in the best sense of the word, whose contributions as a naval officer and public servant made us a better country and people. In New Hampshire, his ‘second favorite state,’ John will always be remembered and beloved. Billy and I join with all Granite Staters in keeping the McCain family in our thoughts and prayers. 
One of his most memorable moments in New Hampshire was during a campaign stop in Wolfeboro in 2008, when a mother stood up and asked John to wear a bracelet with her son’s name on it. Her son, Matthew Stanley, was only 22 years old when he died serving in Iraq. She wanted to make sure that her son’s sacrifice wasn’t forgotten. John said he’d be honored to wear the bracelet. In his final days, John continued to wear the bracelet of Matthew Stanley on his wrist. John was true to his word and true to his convictions until the end. You can watch that incredible moment here. 
Demanding Action for Survivors of Military Sexual Trauma 
I am deeply disturbed by the conclusions of the report that the VA denied 1,300 claims of PTSD for survivors of military sexual trauma. It documents a complete systemic failure by the VA for many victims of sexual abuse. Sexual assault is a life-altering traumatic experience that often dramatically impacts the physical and mental health of service members. I am demanding that the VA ensure that PTSD claims related to MST are managed appropriately and without delay. 
Stopping the Sabotage of Our Health Care 
The Trump administration continues to sabotage our health care system and has expanded short-term health insurance plans – so-called junk plans – that would further destabilize health insurance markets. Junk plans hurt Americans by luring away younger and healthier individuals from comprehensive coverage and then raising the premium costs of older individuals and patients with pre-existing conditions like cancer, diabetes, and pregnancy. 
I'm supporting legislation to overturn the administration’s efforts to sabotage our health care system. We need to stabilize the health care marketplace and ensure access to quality health care for all Americans.  
Guns Don't Belong in Schools 
Last week, Education Secretary DeVos announced she was considering using federal funds to arm teachers in schools. This dangerous policy proposal is mind-boggling. Just two months ago I questioned Betsy DeVos on the high rate of school shootings in the U.S. She refused to discuss the role that guns play in school safety. Now, she’s proposing MORE guns in schools paid for by U.S. taxpayers. This couldn’t be more wrongheaded. Schools should be gun free zones. I wrote to Secretary DeVos opposing this proposal and I’ll do all I can to stop it in its tracks. 
Around New Hampshire  
￼
I joined the Solidarity Walk for Immigrant Justice in Epping, where I thanked advocates for speaking out on behalf of immigrants, including members of New Hampshire’s Indonesian community who are being threatened with deportation. 
￼ 
It was great to be in Milford to visit Hitchiner Manufacturing Company to discuss their recently announced expansion and their workforce development efforts. Everywhere I go in New Hampshire, companies are having trouble hiring enough employees to meet business demand. Companies like Hitchiner are making crucial investments in workforce training and development to overcome these challenges and fill good jobs. 
￼ 
I appreciated the chance to tour the Audobon Wildlife Sanctuary and speak with the New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association (NHTOA), the Audubon Society, and the Forest Society about the forest economy.
Announcing the New U.S. Marshal for NH 
￼  
I was thrilled to announce that former Manchester Police Chief Nick Willard was unanimously confirmed by the Senate to serve as United States Marshal for New Hampshire. Willard’s experience as Chief of Police of New Hampshire’s largest city makes him uniquely qualified for this role, particularly his efforts to combat the opioid epidemic and support children who have been exposed to violence. Through his service, he has demonstrated a commitment to building a safer New Hampshire for all of us. I was proud to support his nomination and I look forward to working with him on public safety issues affecting our state.

ISSUES 
Dear Friend, 
I want to express my sadness for John McCain’s passing. Senator McCain sacrificed his life to defend America and our ideals, touching the lives of many Americans and the United States Congress will never be the same without his efforts. May his life of service be remembered by generations of Americans and that his loved ones find comfort in the days ahead. 
District Update 
I had a productive meeting this week with American Diabetes Association representatives to discuss concerns about insulin affordability, type 2 diabetes in children, and ongoing research and prevention efforts. 
￼ 
It was great to meet with Zapatos, Inc. this week to discuss their mission to provide shoes to children in need in San Antonio so they can have good footwear to get to and from school and participate in recess, athletics and other activities.
￼   ￼
Great meeting this week with leadership of Microsoft’s data centers in TX-20 to learn more about their facilities, discuss their engagement with the local community, and hear their perspective on expanding the talent pipeline in San Antonio for the tech industry.
￼   ￼
Great joining the 2018 Bexar County 4-H Awards Program to recognize high students and scholarship recipients for 2017-2018. Congrats to all the 4-H participants, and thanks to Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service and Bexar County 4-H for their continued cultivation of students interest in STEM education. 
￼   ￼ 
Team Castro attended the San Antonio ISD Public Meeting last week where school district officials discussed proposed changes to the Fox Tech Campus and the addition of a new central administration facility; joined San Antonio Chamber of Commerce’s #CSSAtx to hear updates on how San Antonio’s leaders in this industry are continuing to advance their field and build the reputation of San Antonio as a leader in cybersecurity; joined the Alamo Area Metropolitan Planning Organization for a presentation from Southwest Research Institute on the state of automated and connected vehicles, plans for Loop 1604, and addressing air quality concerns; attended the Family Tapestry News Conference and Community Report this week at the Witte Museum; hosted Senior office hours at Bethel Senior Center to discuss ways our office can assist; and joined the Coalition of West Side Neighborhood Presidents to discuss those issues they have to in common with some elected officials. Having a voice in neighborhood plans and SA Tomorrow is critical to the West side. 
￼   ￼   ￼
￼   ￼   ￼ 
Holding the Administration Accountable for Family Reunification 
In July, I wrote Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services inquiring about the well-being of children in their care. Secretary Nielsen told me flat out at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus meeting that “to [her] knowledge” no child had died or been seriously injured. Yet VICE News reported that a toddler, Mariee, died because of an infection contracted in a family detention center. This Administration has provided inaccurate or false answers to Congress on this issue and I will continue to hold them accountable.

As Congress continues to address issues that directly affect San Antonians’ daily lives, I want to hear from you. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or questions for me by calling my office at 210-348-8216 or reaching out online through my website, Castro.House.gov.

8/31/18 14:27,News from Nita: College Affordability & Accessibility — Federal Terrorism Funding for Local Orgs — Service Medals for WWII Veteran — $ to Fight Youth Substance Abuse,"￼
ABOUT NITA           CONSTITUENT SERVICES           NEWSROOM           LEGISLATIVE ISSUES           17th DISTRICT           CONTACT ME 
Dear Friend:
Here are some of the ways in which I'm fighting hard this week to keep Lower Hudson Valley communities safe, healthy, and secure: 
	•	Fighting to Increase College Affordability and Accessibility
	•	Announcing $400K in Federal Terrorism Funding for Local Nonprofits 
	•	Securing Overdue Service Medals for Family of Local WWII Veteran
	•	Announcing $1,625,000 in Federal Funding to Fight Local Youth Substance Abuse
Fighting to Increase College Affordability and Accessibility 
￼ 
Congresswoman Lowey and Pace University President Marvin Krislov convene a roundtable discussion on college affordability and accessibility.  
This week, Pace University President Marvin Krislov and I were joined by college and graduate school students and administrators at a roundtable discussion on college affordability and accessibility, including the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform (PROSPER) Act, dangerous Republican legislation to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. 
	•	As colleges open for the fall semester, it's as important as ever that we redouble our efforts to tackle the rising costs of higher education and the crushing burdens of student debt.
	•	Making college affordable so that every young person can have the training to pursue their dreams used to be a bipartisan belief in Washington, and yet, House Republicans are currently pushing a partisan, mean-spirited bill that would cut $15 billion from federal student aid while increasing the cost of a college education. This bill is, quite simply, an assault on the financing of higher education as we know it.  
Announcing $400K in Federal Terrorism Funding for Local Nonprofits 
I was pleased to announce a total of $400,000 in federal funding to protect nonprofits in Rockland and Westchester Counties. The awards are: $100,000 for JCC Rockland in West Nyack, $150,000 for JCC on the Hudson in Tarrytown, and $150,000 for JCC of Mid-Westchester in Scarsdale.   
	•	The funding for JCC Rockland was awarded as part of a new homeland security grant program I secured in the Fiscal Year 2018 spending bill. As the senior Democrat in the House Appropriations Committee, I fought tooth and nail to create this new investment in critical homeland security funding so that nonprofit organizations have the resources to protect against acts of hate and terror
	•	This new funding for Rockland, in addition to continued investments in Westchester County, will improve the safety of our community.  
	•	Together, these grants are a major victory to protect residents and community organizations in Rockland and Westchester. 
Securing Overdue Service Medals for Family of Local WWII Veteran 
￼ 
Congresswoman Lowey presents services medals to the family of a local WWII veteran  
I presented three overdue service medals to the family of Anthony Giaccio, a deceased Navy veteran of World War II, at a ceremony in White Plains. 
	•	These medals are a testament to Mr. Giaccio's distinguished service to our country, and I was deeply honored to be able to secure and present them to the Giaccio family and to pay tribute to Mr. Giaccio.
	•	Even after his passing, Mr. Giaccio's legacy lives on, and I know his family will be enormously proud and inspired every time they look at these medals and think about his service and sacrifice.
	•	Our nation owes brave veterans like Mr. Giaccio and their families an enormous debt of gratitude. Veterans or family members who believe they or a loved one are eligible for service medals should contact my White Plains District Office (914-428-1707) or New City District Office (845-639-3485). 
Announcing $1,625,000 in Federal Funding to Fight Local Youth Substance Abuse 
This week, I announced that 13 local organizations will receive a total of $1,625,000 in new and continuation federal grants for youth anti-substance abuse initiatives through the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Drug-Free Communities (DFC) Program.
	•	Our children deserve the opportunity to grow, learn, and thrive in communities free of harmful substances.
	•	These Drug Free Communities grants will help prevent youth alcohol and drug abuse, which is particularly important at a time when the opioid crisis is impacting communities across the nation. 
	•	As Ranking Member on the House Appropriations Committee, I will continue fighting to ensure this important program receives the federal funding it deserves. 
Staying in Touch  It is an honor to represent the Lower Hudson Valley in the United States Congress. To stay in touch and get the latest updates, please connect with me on Facebook and on Twitter.  If you have questions or need assistance, please contact my office in Westchester County at (914) 428-1707, Rockland County at (845) 639-3485, or Washington, D.C., at (202) 225-6506, and we will do all we can to help.

Record Number of Judges, Nominees Confirmed
 
Although August is usually a slow time in Washington, the Senate has been hard at work this year to carry out the work the American people sent us here to do - despite historic obstruction from our friends across the aisle. Just this month, the Senate confirmed fifteen lifetime appointments to the Judiciary and several dozen executive branch nominees. Some of these positions include appointments to the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Treasury’s Intelligence department. Not bad for a month when the Senate is usually not in session.
 
To date, the Senate has confirmed sixty-eight judicial nominees – forty-two district court judges and twenty-six circuit court judges – in addition to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. And next week, the Senate Judiciary Committee will begin hearings for the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the Supreme Court. Although I do not sit on the Judiciary Committee, I look forward to following the hearings closely and hearing Judge Kavanaugh’s rationale and points of view.
 
Even though obstructionists have fought tooth and nail to slow down and stall consideration of many of these highly qualified nominees, the Senate has carried on the work of making sure our courts and critical executive branch positions are filled with the best possible individuals. The work we’ve done this August will impact the U.S. judiciary for decades to come, which is why it was so crucial to stay in Washington until it was finished. Under the Constitution, part of the Senate’s duties are to provide ‘advice and consent’ for such nominees, and we will continue doing our job.

Mourning the Loss of An American Hero  
Country First. John McCain lived by those words. I was deeply saddened to hear of his passing last weekend after a courageous year-long fight against brain cancer. A colleague and friend of mine for many years, John McCain was a true American hero who served his country with the utmost honor and integrity as a Navy Captain, POW in the Vietnam War, and a highly distinguished U.S. Senator for over three decades. During the 2008 Presidential race, I served Senator McCain as one of his campaign surrogates and I was honored to be a part of his team.  I offer my heartfelt condolences to Cindy McCain, the McCain family, and all those whose lives were touched by this patriot.

￼

Many of you may be following the services and ceremonies taking place around the country in his honor. Today, that the late Senator John S. McCain Lies in State at the United States Capitol Rotunda. A full list of events, as well as a tribute to McCain can be found HERE. 
Oak Ridge National Laboratory 
On Monday, I visited Tennessee’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Y‑12 National Security Complex with my good friends and colleagues, Senator Lamar Alexander and Rep. Chuck Fleischmann. Established in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project, Oak Ridge is the largest U.S. Department of Energy science and energy laboratory, conducting basic and applied research to deliver transformative solutions to compelling problems in energy and security. 

￼

￼

With every visit I make to these facilities, I come away so impressed with the work being done. From advanced nuclear innovation, to artificial intelligence, to the world’s fastest supercomputer, Oak Ridge is leading our nation when it comes to solving some of the world's most ambitious challenges. It is important that we continue to support Oak Ridge at the federal level and provide needed resources so that they can maintain our nation’s role as a global leader in energy and technology innovation. Thank you, Director Zacharia, and the entire ORNL team for such an inspiring visit.


Always Looking for Good Women and Men  

One of my greatest honors of representing Tennessee’s 7th district is having the privilege of nominating some of our state's finest young men and women to our prestigious United States Service Academies. This past weekend, our Congressional office held an Academy Day Program at Franklin High School for the students from the 7th district who were interested in applying to the U.S. Air Force, Coast Guard, Merchant Marine, Military, and Naval Academies. We also had the Collegiate ROTC Programs participate. 
￼
It is a tremendous honor to be chosen for these elite academies, and those who apply, make a profound commitment to serve our nation. We’re incredibly proud of these bright young Tennesseans and wish them all the best in the next chapter of their lives.

Continuing to Close the Digital Divide in Tennessee   

This Wednesday, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced winners of the Connect America Fund Phase II auction, who were selected to help expand broadband in rural areas of the country. It is wonderful to see the FCC continue their work to help us close the digital divide. Several Tennessee providers won grants from this auction such as Ben Lomand Communications LLC, Holston Connect LLC, and Meriwether Lewis Connect LLC – congratulations and thank you for your commitment to help ensure every Tennessean can participate in the 21st century economy no matter where they live.
It is unacceptable that 30 percent of Americans AND 20 Percent of Tennesseans, in rural areas still lack access to high-speed internet. And while the percentage of rural Tennesseans without access to high-speed internet has decreased from 34% to 23%, we must continue to push. I have been working for years to expand broadband to unserved areas of Tennessee. As Chair of the Communications and Technology Subcommittee in Congress, I’ve led the efforts on removing federal barriers to broadband deployment, increasing the amount of spectrum available for wireless broadband, and funding key initiatives through appropriate federal agencies. For the past year, we drafted and held hearings on 25 broadband infrastructure solutions, many of which were signed into law this past spring as part of RAY BAUM’S Act. 
I applaud the FCC for taking action to close the digital divide. I will continue to work in Congress to make sure all Tennesseans and Americans have access to a 21st Century Internet for a 21st Century economy.

Supporting Tennessee Farmers   

Many of you heard last week that a District Court Judge in South Carolina reinstated the Obama administration’s 2015 Waters of the U.S. rule, otherwise known as “WOTUS” in 26 states, including Tennessee. This harmful rule seeks to regulate bodies of water such as drainage ditches and mud puddles on farmland that have no business being regulated by the federal government. Moreover, the rule reaches far beyond the federal government’s constitutional authority and would create a regulatory nightmare and cause widespread uncertainty and confusion for farmers, ranchers, and landowners of all kinds in Tennessee, and across the nation. 
￼
This week, I led the effort in urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to appeal this district court’s ruling, and work towards a permanent solution to reduce regulatory uncertainty and get WOTUS off the books. I want to thank all of my Tennessee Republican colleagues for joining me in this effort, as well as the Tennessee Farm Bureau for supporting us. The Trump administration has taken an aggressive approach to remove unnecessary, job-killing regulations. We need to continue to push to reign in the previous administration’s “one-size-fits-all” agenda so that Tennesseans can work and live without the undue burdens of big government.

A Step in the Right Direction on Trade   

This week, President Trump announced a trade agreement with Mexico. While I remain very concerned about the administration’s imposition of tariffs, it is encouraging that we have reached a bilateral understanding that will benefit American workers and businesses. Farmers, manufacturers, and producers across Tennessee want free and fair trade, and it’s wonderful to see our President stand up for our country and renegotiate trade deals that previously helped other countries far more than they did us. We need modernized trade deals that expand market access and opportunities for American industries, and I am glad that the President and United States Trade Representative have taken this initial step in the right direction. 

Have a Safe & Blessed Labor Day Weekend  

This weekend, we commemorate the tremendous social and economic achievements of American workers everywhere, and pay tribute to the contributions they have made to the strength, prosperity, and well-being of our country. But this Labor Day we have something extra special to celebrate. With a soaring economy, millions of American workers are seeing the benefits of tax reform and this administration’s pro-growth economic policies. Unemployment is at record lows, incomes are rising, and businesses are investing in their communities and employees. Tennessee families and small businesses are seeing real results. As your Representative, I will continue to advocate for pro-growth policies like Tax Reform 2.0 that get government out of the way and put more money in your pocket. Thank you to all Tennessee workers who serve as the engine of our economy, and who sacrifice to make our state such a great place to live and work!

Yours in Service,

Meeting Deputy Jordan Sherrill 
I want to begin our newsletter with an update on some great news. Many of you may have read about or been praying for Deputy Jordan Sherrill--one of our Caldwell County Deputies who was shot during a traffic stop in July. 
This week, I was honored to meet Deputy Sherrill and personally tell him 'thank you.' He’s an outstanding young man and deputy. Most importantly, I’m extremely grateful to tell you he is recovering well! 
Please continue praying for him and his family in the coming days and weeks as he continues his recovery.

Honoring Susan Belcher and Chancellor David Belcher 
I was grateful to present Western Carolina University's Susan Belcher with an official U.S. Flag, flown over the U.S. Capitol building in honor of her late husband, Chancellor David Belcher, who passed away this past summer.
We are so thankful for the Belchers and everything they've done for the WNC community. Meredith Whitfield from Western Carolina tweeted about our presentation with the photo here.

Investigation Update – Interviewing Bruce Ohr 
On Tuesday this week, the House Judiciary and House Oversight Committees in Congress paused recess to reconvene and privately interview Bruce Ohr, a DOJ official who was at the center of the issue with the infamous, uncorroborated dossier and investigating the Trump campaign.
Here are some key facts you need to know about Bruce Ohr to understand why he is important to our investigation: 
	•	Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie Ohr, worked for Fusion GPS – which was the firm hired by the Clinton campaign to write the dossier.
	•	Bruce Ohr gave the dossier to the FBI.
	•	The FBI then used the same dossier to spy on the Trump campaign.
In other words, from what we know, it looks like Bruce Ohr was the Department of Justice’s middle man between the Clinton campaign and the FBI. We also have records showing at least 60+ contacts between Bruce Ohr and Chris Steele who, as you know, was the author of the dossier. We even have records of Ohr and Steele communicating after the FBI had told the American public they had ‘terminated’ Steele as a source!
This is very important. The Department of Justice is not supposed to be involved in partisan political campaigns. If we know Bruce Ohr was communicating with someone like Chris Steele, hired to write a partisan democrat opposition research project, that is a problem. We need to know what they discussed, when they met, and more.
While we aren’t permitted to share everything from the interview publicly, the interview was productive, and we learned some important information that we can use to continue. We will keep you updated as we receive more. 
Ultimately, remember this: this is not about challenging the integrity of institutions like the FBI and DOJ. On the contrary, this investigation is about PROTECTING the integrity of those institutions. The vast majority of men and women at the FBI and DOJ are outstanding, integral, hard-working people who desire to keep you and me safe every day. They deserve our thanks. On the other hand, the evidence we’ve seen clearly shows there were a few rogue actors at the top, from the previous administration, who broke the rules for political purposes. That cannot be allowed to stand.  
This investigation is about bringing accountability to those people – and we will keep working until we do so.  
I interviewed with Fox News’ Sandra Smith before the Bruce Ohr interview to explain more about the situation and why he matters to the topic. You can watch the clip here.

Baudette in 1909 – Lake of the Woods County
 
Dear Friends,
 
Our rural economy relies on trade to get Minnesota’s products to consumers around the world. This week, I headed back out to Washington, D.C. to continue work on the Farm Bill Conference Report. When I got back home, I had a number of opportunities to meet with farmers, producers, and businesses from the Seventh District regarding the Trump Administration’s recently announced Tariff Mitigation Plan, tariff product exclusions, and development on the farm bill conference report. I will continue to fight for trade policies that help our communities succeed and keep Minnesota businesses strong. 
 
Sincerely,
￼ Congressman Collin C. Peterson
Minnesota 7th District
 
Farm Bill Timeline
￼
(Left to right) Senator Debbie Stabenow, Senator Pat Roberts and Representative Mike Conaway
 
I was in Washington this week for a meeting of the “Four Corners” of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees. Chairman Roberts, Ranking Member Stabenow, Chairman Conaway, and I compared notes regarding staff progress on pulling together the farm bill conference report. We discussed how to fund the priorities House Members and Senators want to see in a final package as well as the timeline needed to get a bill done by October 1st. 
 
I discussed this timeline on Agri-Pulse Open Mic – click here to hear the interview.
 
Trade
Minnesota is a major exporting state that depends on the global marketplace to sell a portion of its products. Our state ranks fourth in agricultural exports with the biggest customers in Canada, Mexico, China, and the EU. 
 
The escalating trade war is significantly impacting Minnesota businesses and agriculture producers across a wide-range of sectors. I’ve heard from boat manufacturers, soybean growers, motorcycle makers, biofuel producers, electronics providers, and many more. In some cases, U.S. businesses that regularly purchase imported goods subject to tariffs can apply for exceptions if the increase in price is causing substantial financial difficulties.
 
The U.S. Trade Representative recently announced a process for businesses to request a product exclusion from U.S. Section 301 tariffs on Chinese products. The deadline to apply is October 9th, 2018. If your company is facing hardship due to these particular tariffs and would like to weigh in with my office, please contact my staff aide Zach Martin at Zach.Martin@mail.house.gov.
 
Roseau County Farm Bureau
￼
 
I attended a Farm Bureau meeting in Roseau County on Wednesday. I enjoyed meeting with producers as they discussed issues in agriculture and the state of the industry in Roseau County. Folks continue to share their concerns about trade with me. For more information regarding the USDA’s Tariff Mitigation Plan, see my “Newsstand” section below. 
 
Former USDA Secretary Bergland
￼
Bob and I had the opportunity to play guitar together at an event near Plummer in 2012
 
On Wednesday I had the opportunity to have a short visit with former USDA Secretary Bob Bergland while I was in Roseau. Bob is 90 years old and says he’s “feeling pretty good for being old”. Bob has been a mentor to me over the years and I’m proud to represent the district he held in Congress before being appointed to President Carter’s cabinet. Bob’s legacy is so important to agriculture across our country as he was the first farmer to become the Secretary of Agriculture, and he worked to make sure that crop insurance, rural development, conservation and research worked better for farmers and ranchers across the country. Bob and his wife Helen have been married for 68 years and have spent their retirement enjoying their children and grandchildren in Roseau.
 
Pennington and Red Lake County Farmers Union Conventions
￼
 
The Farmer’s Union chapters of Pennington and Red Lake Counties held their annual convention at the Plummer American Legion and I was honored to be their guest speaker. There was lots of interest and questions on the outcome of the Ag Conference Committee and the supplemental aid to help farmers.
 
News and Views on KFGO
On Tuesday morning I was a guest on News and Views which is hosted by Joel Heitkamp on KFGO. We discussed the effects of the recent aid package being given to farmers across America. We also talked about proposed trade tariffs implemented on certain foreign countries and how they affect our agriculture markets. While I agree we need to renegotiate our trade agreements, we need to make sure they can work for our farmers and ranchers.
 
Listen to our conversation here.
 
Chickadee Check-off
Congratulations to Carrol Henderson on his upcoming retirement from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources after 44 years of public service. During my time in the State Senate I worked with Carrol to help introduce a state-wide conservation program commonly known as the “chickadee check-off.” This is a voluntary check-off box on Minnesota State tax forms that supports non-game conservation efforts. Since its implementation, over $35 million dollars have been directed towards the preservation of habitats for non-game wildlife which include songbirds, frogs, turtles, and pollinators. Minnesota Public Radio interviewed Carrol this week and he talked about our work together in the 1970s to implement this check-off program.
 
You can read about Carrol’s work and listen to the full story here.
 
￼Legislative Update
 
Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act
This week, I introduced the Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act with Representative David Young (R-IA-3) to require all group and individual health plans to cover medically necessary services, including dental procedures, related to congenital anomalies and birth defects. Although many states require insurers to provide this type of coverage, health plans routinely and systematically deny claims under the pretense that they are cosmetic in nature. This bipartisan legislation will help ensure that customers can afford costly reconstructive treatments, particularly when the healthy development of a child is at stake.

USDA announces Tariff Mitigation Plan to offset losses from Administration’s trade war
 
On Monday, USDA Secretary Perdue announced details of their response to the impact from retaliatory tariffs imposed on U.S. agricultural commodity exports.
 
The majority of the funds will come in the form of payments to the producers of crops impacted by the trade war. Soybean farmers will receive $1.65 a bushel, corn growers will receive $0.01 a bushel, dairy producers will receive $0.12 per hundredweight, pork producers will receive $8 per head, and wheat growers will receive $0.14 per bushel. Payments will be made on 2018 actual production.
 
Additional support will come in the form of purchases of a broad range of commodities including milk, pork and others for donation to feeding programs, as well as funding for overseas marketing activities to regain markets harmed by the trade war and expand new markets to offset what we’ve lost. 
 
Full detail on the program can be found from USDA here. 
 
I joined KFGO’s Joel Heitkamp this week to discuss USDA’s plan. That audio is available here.

On August 30, 1813, Martin McLeod was born in Montreal. Arriving at Fort Snelling in 1837, he would trade furs in the Minnesota Valley for twenty years, be instrumental in persuading the Dakota to sign the treaties of Mendota and Traverse des Sioux, and, as a member of the legislature, write the law that created the Minnesota Public School Fund. McLeod County was named after him at its inception in 1856. Martin died in 1860.
 
What’s the Story?

Created in 2001 from the merging of Jennie-O Foods, Inc. and the Turkey Store Company, the Jennie-O Turkey Store has become one of the world’s largest processors and marketers of turkey products. Jennie-O Turkey Store is based in Willmar and employs nearly 7,000 people in its facilities. Jennie-O Foods and The Turkey Store Company were the source of many innovations in the turkey industry. Jennie-O Foods, Inc was among the first to develop the turkey hot dog, while The Turkey Store operated the first federally inspected, cooked-turkey processing plant. Jennie-O Turkey Store is a subsidiary of Hormel Foods Corporation, another Minnesota based company. I have this book of Jennie-O Turkey Store history in my Washington, D.C. office.

Steven “Punky” Clark
June 17, 1953 – August 27, 2018
 
Former White Earth Tribal Council District 1 Representative Steven “Punky” Clark passed away this week on Monday, August 27. Clark was a lifelong resident of the White Earth Reservation, a father of five, and a person with a demonstrated commitment to serving his community. Throughout his life he was involved in various boards and committees, he served as president of the Title VII Indian Education Committee, as a board member on the White Earth Reservation Boys & Girls club, as president of the Bagley Youth Hockey Association, and as a foster parent. 
 
White Earth Tribal Council Chairman Terrence Tibbetts ordered all flags at the White Earth Reservation Business Committee, Tribal Programs and entities to be flown at half-staff in Steven’s honor. My sympathies go out to the Clark family, and to the White Earth Nation, as they mourn Punky’s passing.

Remembering My Friend, U.S. Senator John McCain
￼
Alongside his wife, Cindy, Senator McCain was passionate about fighting the scourge of human trafficking and seeking justice for victims. Here we are with U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Claire McCaskill (D-MO) at a screening of the film ""I Am Jane Doe,"" which chronicles the stories of several underage girls who have been illegally trafficked for sex through online classified advertisements.  
Senator. POW. Veteran. Public servant. Patriot. Truth teller. Maverick. Advocate. Statesman. Grateful son. Devoted husband. Loving father. Friend. Hero. 
It’s difficult to describe U.S. Senator John McCain in a few words. He was a force of nature. Both in life and death, his legacy looms very large in the U.S. Senate, around our country, and across the world.
There are so many who have told – and will continue to tell – the story of John’s life, accolades, and legacy – a story that should be told over and over. I’ll leave it to others to do it justice. For me, John was a friend. And for that reason alone, I’m heartbroken to have lost him. 
Our friendship started first with his wife, Cindy, who I have become very close with over the past few years because of our work together to combat human trafficking. She’s a force in her own right and has the same values and courage that John did. Through her, I got to know John better and learn who he was beyond a public figure.
John had two loves: his family and his country. He was devoted to his mother, wife, and children. He provided them with an uncompromising love, and he instilled in them a wisdom borrowed from his own life of hard-fought battles, triumphs, and innumerable lives touched. 
When I first arrived in the Senate, I knew well John’s reputation as a public servant. But in serving beside him and getting to know him and his family, I got to see up close someone who dedicated his life to standing up for his fellow servicemembers and veterans. He fought for what he believed was right no matter the cost to him. He could be brutal in his disagreements, and lavishing in his praise. What made him a great statesmen though was his ability to admit and learn from his mistakes and failings – a quality that all great men possess that is unfortunately in such short supply these days. He deeply respected those who worked hard, especially those who served beside him in the military, the Senate, and across Arizona.
We also formed a bond working together to stand up for Indian Country through our work in the U.S. Senate. One of the last bills of his that became law was legislation he and I worked on together to create Amber Alerts in Indian Country to protect Native American children. John’s commitment and dedication to improving lives in Indian Country will be greatly missed. 
John was a needed and important voice in the U.S. Senate during his decades of service – whether you agreed with him or not. He had the courage to stand up against anyone or anything and always speak his mind because of what he had endured in his lifetime. He didn’t hesitate to hold anyone accountable, including himself. 
At the same time, he brought people together. John understood that to get results and for the Senate to function as it’s supposed to, you have to be able to work together. He was willing to work with anyone – Republican, Democrat, or anyone in between – to do what he believed was just. He also understood that he could disagree with you on an issue and still be your friend. We need more men and women like John McCain in the Senate.
So many of us have stories about John. 
Adrienne Linde, a Gold Star wife from Bismarck, posted on Facebook about John several days ago. She wrote about how she attended the State of the Union in 2013 as my guest, and at the congressional dinner before the address, she noticed John from across the room.
She said, “He walked up to me and asked why I was wearing a fallen soldier bracelet. I told him it was for my husband who had been killed in Afghanistan just two months prior. John McCain showed me his bracelet and said a mother of a fallen soldier in Arizona gave him her son’s bracelet. He said he’d never taken it off. John McCain then kissed my forehead and said bless you and your family and walked away. His genuine kindness really touched me. A few months ago it seemed apparent his battle with brain cancer would not be beaten. I sent John McCain Darren’s bracelet and wished him continued strength. Our country has lost another incredible hero.”
This is who John McCain was and what he means to so many Americans – especially to those who served and those who lost loved ones who served. He will be missed by so many. And I will miss my friend.

￼
SERVING YOU  |  MEDIA CENTER  |  LEGISLATIVE WORK  |  OUR DISTRICT
 
August 31, 2018
 
 
 Dear Friend,   John McCain dedicated his entire life to our country. His commitment to public service and the founding values of our country were unparalleled and, like all Rhode Islanders, I was very sad to learn of his passing.  As the son and grandson of four-star admirals, Senator McCain learned early in his life the responsibility that all Americans have to put our country before ourselves.  America first learned his name during the five and a half years he spent as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. He was beaten and tortured for days on end, leaving him with scars and permanent physical injuries. Still, he maintained his resolve and refused to accept an offer of early release so he wouldn’t give his captors a propaganda victory.  In Congress, Senator McCain remained true to his convictions. He led the fight for campaign finance reform, brought Republicans and Democrats together to try and fix our broken immigration system, and never hesitated to stand up to bullies and demagogues on either side of the aisle. In an era defined by partisanship, Senator McCain broke ranks with his own party to oppose the use of torture by the Bush administration, to expose the corrupt activities of Jack Abramoff, and to cast the deciding vote that preserved the Affordable Care Act last year.  He is an American hero and a man of incredible, unbreakable courage. And he is an example to all of what it means to be a statesman, not a politician, because he always put our country first.  Last Sunday, I joined CNN’s State of the Union panel with Jake Tapper to reflect on the life and legacy of Senator John McCain. You can watch the segment on my Facebook page by clicking here.  RENEGOTIATING NAFTA   On Monday, President Trump announced that the United States and Mexico had reached an agreement to revise portions of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). While waiting for Canada to jump on board, he also suggested the trade pact would be finalized within days.  Bad trade deals and Republican tax cuts for the wealthy have shipped jobs overseas and held down American wages for decades. As President Trump works on a new trade deal with our neighboring countries, it is critical that he fix these problems.  Any new agreement needs to give working Americans a raise, eliminate incentives that ship American jobs to other countries, and put working men and women first, ahead of corporate special interests.  I look forward to reviewing this agreement in full once the administration submits it to Congress.  ENHANCING PUBLIC SAFETY   As your Representative, bringing federal funding back to Rhode Island is one of my top priorities in Congress. That is why I am so excited to share with you that more than $3.8 million in federal funding has been awarded to our state to enhance local fire departments’ abilities to meet recommended staffing, response, equipment, and operational standards.  The Cumberland, Saylesville, Smithfield, and Woonsocket Fire Departments will use these grants to hire and train new firefighters. These federal funds are being awarded through the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Staffing for Adequate Fire & Emergency Response (SAFER) Grant Program to help local fire departments comply with the standards established by the National Fire Protection Association.  These critical resources will help Rhode Island firefighters effectively respond to emergencies and allow the brave men and women in these departments to help keep our communities safe.  PROTECT STUDENTS, NOT FOR-PROFIT SCHOOLS   Once again, we’re seeing the Trump administration put special interests ahead of hardworking Rhode Islanders. Since 1993, students who have been misled by their institution of higher education have had a legal right, legislated by Congress, to relief from their federal student loans.  Last month, however, the U.S. Department of Education proposed a new rule to reduce loan relief for defrauded students by $12.7 billion over 10 years and make it nearly impossible for students to have their loans discharged. No one who’s been a victim of fraud should be told to fend for themselves.  Student loan debt is a bigger problem today than either credit card or auto debt. According to recent reports, Rhode Island is the 7th-worst state to live in for folks paying off student debt. Seven in ten American college graduates have student loan debt today and one out of every five owes more than $100,000 on the loans they took out to earn their degree.  This is also not the first time Secretary DeVos has taken the side of fraudulent universities over students. It’s ridiculous that she wants to make it even more difficult for students to recover money that’s been stolen from them by shady for-profit institutions. I wrote to Secretary DeVos strongly opposing these measures and urging her to revise the proposal and provide all students the relief to which they are entitled.  You can read that letter on my website by clicking here.  REPUBLICAN SABOTAGE OF THE ACA   I joined representatives from HealthSourceRI and members of my Congressional Women’s Advisory Council on Monday to discuss how Republicans are sabotaging the Affordable Care Act by driving up the cost of health care and threatening care for some of our most vulnerable Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions. During our panel, I also laid out the House Democrats' plan to protect affordable health care and lower costs for more Americans.

 Honoring Senator John McCain 
￼  
This week our nation lost a true giant. Senator John McCain was the embodiment of service and sacrifice above self. His indomitable spirit taught his fellow Americans to never waver in their commitment to our country. I had the honor of attending a service as he was brought to lie in state at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda -- an honor reserved for the most distinguished Americans. My thoughts and prayers — and those of the Nation — are with the McCain family at this very difficult time. 
Victory for NY-21 Newspapers 
The U.S. International Trade Commission has voted to nullify tariffs on Canadian paper imports, which is tremendous news for our local press corps. These tariffs would unfairly burden those that rely on Canadian paper, including our community newspapers and the families across our district that rely on them. I was pleased to lead the effort in Congress to push back against these tariffs and will continue to support our local press corps. Read more here.  
 Drug Policy Office Awards for Our District 
￼ 
This week the White House Drug Policy Office announced $625,000 in grants to organizations across our district to prevent youth substance abuse, including prescription drugs, marijuana, tobacco, and alcohol abuse. This needed funding will help make our communities healthier. As a Member of the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force, I applaud the White House for making this funding in our district a priority. I will continue to work in Congress to combat addiction and ensure that our communities have the resources they need in this fight. Read details about these awards here.  
Federal Employee Pay Raises 
Yesterday, the White House announced it was cancelling pay raises for federal employees that were scheduled for this January. I oppose this decision by the White House. Our district is home to many dedicated and hardworking federal employees, such as Customs and Border Patrol agents, federal firefighters, and Department of Defense civilian employees working alongside our men and women in uniform. These families work hard to serve our district and to protect our communities, and they should receive the pay raise as scheduled. I will be working with my colleagues on the House Appropriations Committee to see the pay raise included in our funding process, as ultimately Congress controls the power of the purse.
Labor Day 2018 
￼ 
The North Country is home to hundreds of thousands of men and women who rise each day to run our small businesses, manufacture top of the line products, grow our crops, teach our children, protect our communities, and much, much more. I have been honored to meet so many of you across our district and remain committed to working on your behalf to ensure you have the jobs you need to support your families and to support our North Country way of life. I wish each of you - and Americans across our nation - a safe and enjoyable Labor Day weekend. 
As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates! 
Sincerely,

8/31/18 12:41,Blaine’s Bulletin: Honoring Jeffrey L. White Jr.,"￼ 
August 31, 2018

BLAINE'S BULLETIN

March 16, 2018 was just another Friday for many Americans.  We woke up, went to work and looked forward to the weekend ahead. For the White family in Catawissa, Missouri, however, it was the day that the President of the United States signed into law a bill to honor their son’s bravery and heroism in service to our country. 
Army Specialist Jeffrey L. White, Jr. grew up in Catawissa with his parents, Jeff and Paula White and his brothers Michael and Kyle. Jeffrey graduated from Pacific High School in 2008 and joined the U.S. Army the following year. After completing basic and advanced training at Fort Benning, Georgia, he was stationed at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska before being deployed to Afghanistan in 2011. During his time in the Army, Jeffrey’s bravery and selflessness earned him numerous awards and recognitions including the Bronze Star and Purple Heart.
Only a week before he was scheduled to come home on leave, Jeffrey tragically lost his life on April 3, 2012. He passed away from injuries sustained by an improvised explosive device (IED) that detonated near his unit in the Khost province of Afghanistan.
In November of 2016, I introduced legislation to dedicate the Post Office in Pacific as the “Specialist Jeffrey L. White, Jr. Post Office,” in honor of one of Missouri’s own. With the support of my Missouri Congressional colleagues, the House and Senate passed the legislation to honor Jeffrey and on March 16, 2018 President Trump officially signed the bill into law. Last week, it was my honor to join Jeffrey’s family and local officials for the official dedication of the Pacific Post Office in his memory. It was truly humbling to be among the many people there to pay tribute to our local hero.  In the face of great sadness, the White family has taught us all a lesson in strength and grace. We sometimes forget that the families of our soldiers also must live their lives knowing their entire world can be turned upside down in a moment and without notice.  Their bravery and service, just like Jeffrey’s, is something for which we are all eternally grateful. 
Last week’s ceremony was another reminder that freedom is not free, a reality the White family knows far too well. Next time you drive by the Specialist Jeffrey L. White Jr. United States Post Office, please take a second to remember the bravery and sacrifice of those who protect our great nation, especially the third district’s own Jeffrey L. White Jr.

Dear Lindsey,
  I wanted to remind you about an upcoming event on September 8th! I am pleased to invite middle school and high school-aged students who live or attend school in the Fourth District to participate in my annual Congressional App Challenge. Please feel free to share this information with any students you know who may be interested in participating, or with teachers, administrators, or others with an interest in computer science or technology development.  The Congressional App Challenge asks students to create an original application, or “app”, for a mobile device, tablet, or computer. To inspire and assist students in the creation and design process, I am hosting a Student Hackathon on Saturday, September 8 from 9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. at Fidelity Investments in Research Triangle Park. The event will feature workshops on “design thinking” and public speaking. The event is free, and lunch will be provided to participants. Students are asked to bring a laptop, but those in need of a laptop can reserve one by contacting my office at 202-225-1784. To attend the Hackathon, students should RSVP at  http://bit.ly/2018Hackathon no later than Wednesday, September 5.
App Challenge participants may work individually or in groups of up to four to design an app on a topic of their choosing. Entrants are not required to submit the source of code for the app – only a brief video that explains the app’s purpose. To sign up for the App Challenge, students should visit CongressionalAppChallenge.us. Apps are due by noon on October 15.
App Challenge submissions will be judged by a panel of local science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) leaders from industry and academia, and finalists will have the opportunity to pitch their app to a panel of judges at an event in November. All App Challenge participants, parents, teachers, and administrators will be invited to join me at this event, the details of which will be provided to participants upon submission of their app. The winners will also have their work displayed in the Capitol building and will be invited to a reception in Washington, D.C.!
Please feel free to share this exciting opportunity with others. If you have any questions regarding the Congressional App Challenge, please contact my Washington D.C. Office at 202-225-1784.  
Sincerely, 
￼

Recess??? 
August is the month that the national media likes to say that Congress is on ""recess."" I don't know about you, but when I think about recess, I think about tether balls, jungle gyms, four-square, and swing sets. My days in August are anything but that. Typically, I'm out the door early in the morning and don't get back home until late in the evening. But, this time is important, because this month gives me the opportunity to get away from Washington and back home to meet with all of you. 
As is typical, I visited and made stops in each of the 18 counties I represent during the month. Below, you'll find highlights of just a few of my August visits, tours, and meetings. 
￼ 
Big News for Belmont County 
￼ 
At the Belmont County Courthouse in St. Clairsville on August 17 for a major announcement by the USDA. 
I joined the Assistant Director of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Belmont County Commissioners, and other local officials for a major announcement on August 17...the county was awarded a low-interest loan and grant combining for over $60 million. This Rural Development investment will be used to finance much needed comprehensive improvements to the county's water system, including construction of a 6 million gallon-per-day water treatment plant, replacing an outdated facility that lacks capacity and fails to meet current water standards. The Belmont County Water System encompasses more than 500 miles of water lines, serves 9,700 rural residents directly, and provides water to an additional 23,300 county residents through wholesale agreements. This is a very big deal.
This is a great example of federal, state, and local agencies and officials working together in the best interest of those we serve…no one cared about partisan politics or anything else except improving the lives of people in Belmont County. Early in the grant application process,I hosted a conference call that brought all the involved parties together to aid in the effort to secure this funding. 
The positive economic developments in Belmont County over the last few years have been incredible. It’s another good sign for the potential ethane cracker plant, as this investment will serve as the platform for the county to absorb demands for future economic development. The Belmont County Commissioners should be commended for creating a positive environment and for being proactive in going after this funding. And, thank you to Anne Hazlette of the USDA for making the trip out for the announcement ceremony. With so many positive things going on here, I’m confident this won’t be her last trip to our area.    
News coverage of this announcement can be viewed here and here. 
American Axle & Manufacturing  
￼ 
On August 22, I toured American Axle & Manufacturing in Minerva. 
Reforming our nation’s outdated tax code through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has energized our economy, resulting in the lowest unemployment rate since 2000, record job creation, rising wages, and high levels of consumer and business optimism. It is absolutely vital that manufacturers in Eastern and Southeastern Ohio and across the country are supported, and I appreciated the opportunity to tour the American Axle & Manufacturing facility in Minerva last week and speak directly with employees there. I look forward to continuing my work to promote sensible policies that put American businesses back in high gear, make them more competitive in the global marketplace, and put hardworking taxpayers back in charge of their own destiny – policies that ensure all Americans win.
Flood Insurance Issues 
At the start of the month, I met with Marietta Area Chamber of Commerce members, small business owners, and local residents of Marietta regarding the issue of flood insurance. 
It was a productive discussion, and I’ll be taking some of what I heard back to Washington to share with my colleagues. I’ve supported legislation passed in the House to reform the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), to make it more effective, affordable, and to bring insurance premiums down. At the end of July, I supported a measure in the House to extend the NFIP for four months (it was set to expire at the end of July) as the Senate continues to debate the House’s long-term reauthorization with much-needed reforms.
National Shooting Sports Month 
Last Friday, I visited Come Shoot Indoors in Martins Ferry as part of National Shooting Sports Month. I met with employees, learned more about the business, toured their facilities, and then headed to their range to do some practice shooting. Come Shoot Indoors is a locally-owned, family-owned, licensed firearms company that offers Concealed Carry permits (I am a holder of one myself). All of their employees have a background in either law enforcement or the military.
I think my practice went well...you can judge for yourself by looking at the target I shot at below. 
￼ 
I know our Second Amendment rights are fundamental, and they must be protected. As your representative, I've led on this issue. I have co-sponsored several bills to protect our right to keep and bear arms, including: H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act; H.R. 2620, the Lawful Purpose and Self Defense Act; H.R. 1045, the Recreational Lands Self-Defense Act of 2017; and H.R. 788, the Target Practice and Marksmanship Training Support Act. I will continue working hard to protect your Second Amendment rights.
Veterans Resource Fair 
On August 16, at the Kent State Tuscarawas Performing Arts Center in New Philadelphia, I co-hosted a Veterans Resource Fair with my colleague Rep. Bob Gibbs. It was an excellent opportunity for area veterans to access resources, connect with VA officials, get information on issues specific to them, learn about educational opportunities, and much more. Many organizations participated, including: the Tuscarawas County Veterans Service Commission; Concerned Veterans of America; Ohio Means Jobs; Kent State University-Stark; representatives from the Department of Veterans Affairs; Honor Flight, and many other groups. Thank you to all the groups who were represented at this important event.
As a 26-year veteran of the United States Air Force, I am grateful to all of America's heroes - the men and women who willingly risk their lives to protect and defend our freedoms. One of my top priorities as your representative has been - and will continue to be - ensuring that our veterans and their families receive the benefits, care, and services they have earned through their selfless services and sacrifices. 
Throughout August, I also continued to meet with various veteran-related groups and organizations, including Veterans Service Officers from Lawrence and Jackson Counties, where we discussed issues VSOs face while helping veterans navigate the system for benefits they earned through their service.

Legislative Update 
Tax Reform is Working 
A new piece I wrote on the recent tax reform bill - the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act - ran this week in some local newspapers. It's appropriately titled ""Tax cut misinformation campaign continues."" 
As is often the case, the mainstream, liberal media talking points are flying in the face of reality. The tax cuts are undoubtedly helping Americans across the spectrum. Unemployment is down to its lowest levels in decades. In each of the 18 counties I represent, unemployed rates have decreased by at least 30% (and most more than that) since January of 2017. More than half of small businesses have plans to expand, boost hiring, or increase employee benefits. And, consumer confidence is at an 18-year high. 
I encourage you to read the whole thing here. 
￼
Community Health Centers Funded 
Last week, I was pleased to learn that many Community Health Centers in Eastern and Southeastern Ohio were awarded grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: Hopewell Health Centers (Belpre, Jackson, Pomeroy), Ironton-Lawrence Community Action, Muskingum Valley Health Centers (Cambridge), Ohio Hills Health Services (Barnesville), and Southeast, INC (St. Clairsville and Carrollton). It was fitting these grants were awarded during National Health Centers Week. 
I supported continued funding for Community Health Centers earlier this year in the U.S. House, and I will continue to advocate for funding to make sure these facilities can continue providing high quality, affordable health care to people in Eastern and Southeastern Ohio.

Friends,  
  
This week I joined my colleagues and America in mourning Senator John McCain. Sen. McCain was one of the fiercest warriors this nation has ever seen. He was a true patriot, he moved the ball and was willing to work across the aisle, he was a fearless leader and will be greatly missed.  
  
On a trade front, I was encouraged to see the President make a bilateral agreement with Mexico, but I am hopeful that through these negotiations we will see Canada come back to the table and restore a modernized and fair NAFTA agreement.    Back in the district, it’s been another very busy week travel. We held Community Coffee’s in Washington and Emporia and met with several great organizations to talk about how our work in Washington D.C. impacts their business. We continue to hear from people who are optimistic about our country’s future and seeing the impacts of a growing economy and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   But it’s wasn’t all boardrooms and coffee chats, we took some time to enjoy God’s work and the beauty of the Kansas Flint Hills with members of The Kansas Nature Conservancy and Kansas Livestock Association. We have unique and beautiful resources in Kansas, and I want to guarantee it is around for the next generation to enjoy.    I’m in Salina today and will have the opportunity to spend time with the staff and faculty of Kansas State Polytechnic to learn more about the great work they are doing with UAVs. Kansas is leading the nation in UAV technology, and research and I am eager to see what the future holds for the industry.    TOMORROW I have my FINAL Community Coffee in Lincoln at 9:30 a.m. at the Lincoln Senior Center. I hope you’ll join me.

Bilateral trade deal with Mexico
The days of taking advantage of our American businesses and producers are over. I want to commend USTR and their work to reach an agreement with Mexico. My hope is that our agreement with Mexico will put pressure on Canada to come to the negotiating table today and restore a full and true modernized NAFTA agreement.
From day one President Trump promised that he would negotiate free and fair trade deals that would put America first. I am thrilled to see him make good on that promise by modernizing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and striking a bilateral agreement with Mexico.
The deal updates the NAFTA agreement so that it meets the demands of the 21st-century global economy.  
By TODAY, we expect the Administration to send their intent to sign to Congress. That notice will be followed shortly by the full text being made public.
I look forward to fully reviewing the agreement and swift approval by Congress. I’ve said it over and over again, our farmers need certainty, and solidifying this deal with our Mexican markets is a crucial piece to the puzzle. 
With this agreement, Kansas producers will be treated more fairly as it explicitly reduces trade-distorting policies on agricultural goods and promotes complete transparency between the US and Mexico. 
This weeks announcement of this bilateral trade deal continued the good news for the economy, with the stock market hitting all-time highs once the US and Mexico reached the trade deal. 
Defeating the Democrats and their 
socialist poster candidates
This week Rep. Marshall released an op-ed discussing the upcoming midterm elections. 
The Department of Commerce announced this week that the U.S. economy grew by 4.2 percent in this year's second quarter, the strongest quarter of growth since 2014. Consumer confidence is at an 18-year high and jobless claims are hovering at near 49- year- low. Our economy is booming, yet Bernie Sanders disciples continue to advocate for reckless economic policies like free college and Medicare for all. 
Rep. Marshall welcomes the increase in socialist candidates and encourages the Republican Party to take advantage of failed and recycled socialist ideas. 
""I was a physician in rural Kansas for almost 30 years before I was elected to Congress in 2016,"" Marshall said. ""So personally, I believe the most practical way we can crush the rise of democratic socialists is to tear apart their most popular proposal: Medicare for all.""

Kansas conservation practices 
￼
I spent Wednesday afternoon at the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve with staff from The Kansas Nature Conservancy, Kansas Livestock Association and NRCS enjoying the beautiful Flint Hills and discussing conservation practices. 
Kansas is home to the only ecologically functioning tall grass prairie in North America and it’s important we do all we can to preserve those acres and other grasslands across the state and country. 
Kansas has great leaders on conservation issues and I’m proud of the conservation programs and funding included in the House Farm Bill. 
UPS ride along
￼ 
On Tuesday, I traded in my business attire for a UPS uniform to celebrate the company's 111 birthday. 
I joined the staff in my hometown of Great Bend for a ride along. In my iconic brow UPS uniform, we hit the road and delivered our daily shipments. On our trip, I learned a lot about the company and how it serves our communities. 
￼ 
In addition to celebrating the company on its anniversary, we also recognized local employees for their years of commitment and service. UPS is the world's largest package delivery service.  
Cow sale chats
￼ 
Thank you to Frank Seidel and folks at LaCrosse Livestock Market for the warm welcome and the opportunity to be part of their cow sale. At the sale this week, we were able to talk with their customers about Ag needs and the urgency to pass our 2018 Farm Bill.
BIG NEWS: For Reno Co. Care Center
This week the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced that our own Reno County Communities That Care, operating out of Hutchinson, Kansas, will receive a Mental Health & Substance Abuse Service Grant. 
It is wonderful to see that one of our own Kansas care clinics, received this large grant that allows them to continue their great work and do even more to prevent underage drinking, and drug addiction in Southeast Kansas. I am continually impressed and proud of the work being done by Reno County Communities that Care staff, and thank them for taking excellent care of our folks back home.

News from Representative Lee Zeldin
￼
Dear Lindsey, 
￼
￼
￼
August is always the busiest month of the year for Members of Congress to meet with constituents. This month certainly wasn't any exception. Here's an update:     
Our economy is strong and growing stronger with an economic environment spurring considerable job growth and desperately needed opportunities for American workers. With a 4.2% revised GDP growth rate for Q2 announced, we have the fastest growing economy now in 4 years. When it comes to our economy, Long Island has much to be optimistic about. As of June, our economy had grown by roughly 15,600 jobs in just a year and unemployment rates are reaching record lows, with the unemployment rate in Suffolk County dropping to under 4%; it’s lowest level in over a decade. Read more here.  
My wife, Diana, and I had the pleasure of joining other local officials this past weekend at the Cutchogue Fire Department Annual Chicken Barbecue, the proceeds of which will benefit the fire department. Learn more here.  
￼

This past weekend, the pipe that will run from the Moriches Inlet dredge site to the Smith Point County Park Beach sand deposit location started arriving on site. Last Friday, I was joined by Brookhaven Supervisor Ed Romaine and Councilman Dan Panico to survey the conditions of Moriches Inlet as the emergency dredge begins and visit possible sites for depositing the dredged sand of the upcoming LI Intracoastal Waterway dredge project, including Webby and Great Gun Beaches. Learn more about my efforts to secure an emergency dredge of Moriches Inlet and the Long Island Intracoastal Waterway here.  
￼
 Dredging pipe arrives at Moriches Inlet for emergency dredge.
Along with Brookhaven Supervisor Ed Romaine and other local officials and civic leaders, I announced the dredging of Lower Yaphank Lake to remove sediment and invasive aquatic plant life. Lower Yaphank Lake has long been overrun by invasive species plant life that has undermined the health and vitality of the lake and hindered local residents' ability to spend time fishing and enjoying the water. The Town of Brookhaven and all those who represent this community have been hard at work to get Lower Yaphank Lake cleaned up, restoring wildlife to a vibrant natural habitat through the construction of a fish ladder and now the dredging of decades of sediment and invasive species. I would especially like to thank Brookhaven Town for its leadership running point in the effort to restore Lower Yaphank Lake to its former beauty - clean and clear water, vibrant wildlife and native species, and a place local residents can finally enjoy again. Read more here.

 Rep. Zeldin, along with other local officials, announce dredging of Lower Yaphank Lake. 
It was an honor to be awarded the Peconic River Sportsman’s Club Senator Owen Johnson Man of the Year Award to recognize my leadership in environmental conservation and wildlife preservation. This has included leading the efforts in the House to fully fund the National Sea Grant Program and National Estuary Program, doubling funding for the Long Island Sound Program, getting my legislation passed in the House to preserve Plum Island, leading the charge to save the Land and Water Conservation Fund and making permanent the Conservation Easement Tax Credit. Learn more here.

Nazi war criminal Jakiw Palij, who was residing in Queens, New York, was deported back to Germany. Palij is a convicted war criminal who served as a guard at the Nazi Trawniki camp in Poland. I have long called for the deportation of Jakiw Palij, including in a August 2017 letter to then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Allowing a murderer, who facilitated the deaths of countless innocent people, to live freely, enjoying the liberties that make this country the greatest in the world, was a slap in the face to all the families of those who perished, their memory and the brave American servicemen and women who sacrificed everything for their freedom. Learn more here.  
I toured the Sorenson Video Relay Service Interpreting Center in Hauppauge, the leading provider of video relay services for the deaf. During my visit, I was briefed on the interpreting profession and witnessed a live video demonstration of how the center assists Americans in need of their services.

I held Mobile Office Hours at Rose Caracappa Senior Center in Mount Sinai. During Mobile Office Hours, I met with constituents to discuss issues most important to them, including Medicare, SNAP and many other topics of interest. This Congress, I’ve hosted hundreds of meetings and forums, including Town Halls, Coffee with your Congressman, Pizza and Policy, Mobile Office Hours and one-on-one meetings with constituents.

Over 400,000 students in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem are using United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) textbooks that are brainwashing students in a very negative way about history, Israel and Judaism. In 2016, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) performed an investigation of these textbooks but the findings were classified. That is why I, along with Rep. Scott Perry, just requested a mandatory declassification review of the report to expose the truth and address it. Learn more here.

 **E-NEWS ALERT**  Murphy to Host Event Honoring Vietnam Veterans as Part of the Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War
Vietnam Veterans Invited to Attend Ceremony Honoring their Service
U.S. Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy is hosting a ceremony on Sept. 11, 2018, in Longwood, Fla., to honor Vietnam veterans as part of the Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War -- a 13-year coordinated, nationwide campaign led by the U. S. Department of Defense. At the ceremony, Murphy will present each veteran with a Vietnam veteran lapel pin in recognition of their service and to honor their sacrifice.   All veterans who served between 1955 and 1975 are eligible to participate. Veterans interested in participating should register at murphy.house.gov/Vietnam50.  “The U.S. Navy rescued my family as we fled Communist Vietnam and gave us a shot at the American dream, so I am personally and forever grateful to Vietnam veterans who fought to defend liberty and answered the call of duty,” said Murphy. “I’m incredibly honored to recognize Vietnam veterans in our community as part of the Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War and to thank them for their service. We owe all those who serve and have served our deepest gratitude and respect. If you or someone you know is a veteran, please register at murphy.house.gov/Vietnam50 so that we may honor as many veterans as possible.”  The event will be held on Tuesday, Sept. 11, at 10 a.m. at the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Post 8207, 1520 N. Ronald Regan Boulevard, Longwood, Fla. The event is open to the public, but prior registration is required at murphy.house.gov/Vietnam50. Veterans and families of veterans will be given priority admittance.   The Commemoration honors all United States veterans who served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces at any time between Nov. 1, 1955, to May 15, 1975, regardless of where they served. The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that there are 7 million living Vietnam veterans and 9 million families of those who served in this time frame.  Congress authorized the national commemoration in 2007 in the National Defense Authorization Act, which President George W. Bush signed into law on Jan. 28, 2008. The commemoration officially began with an event at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., on Memorial Day, May 28, 2012, and concludes on Veterans Day, Nov. 11, 2025. The goal, as stated by presidential proclamation, is to commemorate the 50th anniversary over a long period of time since many Americans served and sacrificed over a long period of time.

￼ 




Honoring the Life of John McCain
￼ 
Click HERE to watch the video. 
America has lost John McCain – a true titan of the Senate who was one of our nation’s greatest war heroes and public servants. He will be long remembered for his principled leadership, courage, grit, and always putting country first. It was an honor to call John McCain a friend and serve alongside him in the Senate. 
I believe you really judge an elected official by how they act when they're not in front of a television camera. One of the most memorable experiences I had with Senator McCain was the first time I met him in North Carolina in 2014. With no cameras around, I had the chance to see him interacting with veterans and men and women in uniform. What I saw was a man with a heart of gold who possessed an unwavering commitment to America’s finest. I would go on to serve alongside Senator McCain as a member of the Armed Services Committee, where he was a mentor to myself and other senators. 
Susan and I are deeply saddened by John’s passing, and we send our condolences to Cindy and the McCain family, who have demonstrated incredible grace and strength during this difficult time. Our hearts are with them, and we thank them for allowing him to share some of his life with us here in the Senate.

Providing Funding for America's Men and Women in Uniform
 ￼
In honor of Senator McCain, Congress passed the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019 earlier this month. This legislation reaffirms our nation’s commitment to supporting the brave men and women in uniform and reestablishes America’s commitment to a strong national defense and protecting its interests abroad. I am proud it included several of my provisions to improve the lives of our servicemembers and military families, provide $240 million to upgrade North Carolina’s military installations, and gives servicemembers the largest pay raise in nine years.  


Contact My Office
Thank you for reading my e-newsletter, I will continue to work hard to represent all North Carolinians in the Senate and deliver results. If you or someone you know is having trouble with the VA or any federal agency, please don't hesitate to contact my office. My office has helped thousands of North Carolinians over the past three years dealing with the VA, Social Security Administration, expediting a passport, and much more.

8.30.18 Protecting Health Care for Virginians
Dear Friend, 
I'm thrilled that we recently passed legislation in the Senate that supports health care priorities that are critical to Virginia. From funding cancer research, to protecting the Affordable Care Act, to helping states administer substance abuse treatment, to combatting Alzheimer's, the bill includes key wins that will help make Virginians healthier.   Specifically, the legislation fully funds the Gabriella Miller Kid's First Pediatric Research Program to work towards a cure for childhood diseases. In 2014, Congress passed bipartisan legislation I championed to create this program, named for 10-year-old Gabriella Miller of Loudoun County who passed away from cancer in October of 2013. We've now allocated $63 million for this important research that will help save lives. I'm grateful that my colleagues joined together again this year to honor Gabriella and her inspiring work as an advocate for pediatric disease research through passage of this legislation.  I'm also relieved that we were able to stop language from being included that could have further damaged the Affordable Care Act. Instead, the bill helps protect Medicare, Medicaid, and the ACA. These vital programs have been a lifeline for so many Virginians, and I'll keep doing everything I can to preserve them.   You can read more about the bill here >> 
Health care is a right, and I remain committed to improving the health care system for all Virginians.

Sincerely,
￼
Senator Tim Kaine

Donna Bridge and Veterans Bridge Groundbreaking Ceremonies

This month, I participated in kick-off ceremonies for new construction projects at Donna Rio-Bravo International Bridge and Veterans International Bridge. The Donna Rio-Bravo Bridge project is a critical step toward full commercialization of the bridge, the culmination of years of work by federal, state, and local officials. The current construction will allow empty south-bound commercial trucks to cross the bridge. In the future, infrastructure for empty north-bound trucks will be added as well. Eventually, the bridge will be able to process both full and empty commercial vehicles as they head north and south.
At Veterans Bridge, construction has begun to expand the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) lane which will allow Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to begin testing different types of non-intrusive inspection technologies. This equipment will allow all north-bound trucks to be inspected more thoroughly and quickly.  Upon completion of this project at Veterans Bridge, CBP will install $7 million in X-ray technology to examine trucks as they pass through. This project will help commercial traffic cross the bridge more efficiently and securely, encouraging increased trade in South Texas.  
  
DHS Constructing Wall Without Key Information
As the senior ranking Democratic Member on the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security, I have been working to ensure that the Trump Administration is held accountable for wasteful spending on an unnecessary wall. Last year, ranking Democratic Member of the Homeland Security Committee Bennie Thompson and I directed the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review the Department of Homeland Security’s plans for the southwest border wall.  
The GAO released their report this month. They determined that the cost of the border wall greatly exceeds initial estimates by the President. Furthermore, the calculations were rooted in severely inadequate research about the cost and impact of expanding border fencing. In response, I released a joint statement, warning the public of the careless actions of the Trump Administration in spending taxpayer dollars on an ill-conceived and unwarranted border wall.  
Federal Funds for South Texas Airports
Brownsville South Padre Island International Airport (BRO) and Valley International Airport of Harlingen (HRL) have been awarded grant funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) for upgrades and improvements. BRO was allocated $2 million for the construction of a new terminal and HRL has secured over $6.4 million to upgrade its tarmac and construct additional aircraft parking areas. These projects will improve travel for passengers, create more efficient airport systems for airlines, and make South Texas a more convenient and attractive destination. I am excited about the expansion of both airports and will continue to fully support these important infrastructure projects.

September 4th, 2018 Deadline to Register for FEMA Disaster Assistance
The deadline to apply for FEMA Disaster Assistance is quickly approaching. 
If you were affected by the severe storms and flooding from June to July, 2018, I strongly encourage you to register for FEMA disaster assistance.  
Cameron, Hidalgo, and Jim Wells Counties have received federal disaster declarations and residents of these counties are now eligible to apply for federal assistance. You can register with FEMA online, on the FEMA Mobile App, by calling FEMA at 800-621-3362, or by visiting a disaster recovery center. For a list of disaster recovery centers in South Texas, please click here.  
Resources on how to prepare and respond to this and future natural disasters can be found on my website here.

Dear Friends, 
It was with heavy hearts that we returned to work on Monday mourning the loss of our friend and colleague, Senator John McCain, who passed away on Aug. 25, 2018. 
John and I had served together in the U.S. Senate since 2005. As chairmen of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Veterans’ Affairs Committee, respectively, we had worked closely together to improve care for veterans and ensure a seamless transition for service members from the U.S. Department of Defense to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. 
John’s passing is a loss not only for America, but for all mankind who love freedom and liberty. He sacrificed for the country he loved in every way one could. As a solider, a senator, and a citizen, John represented the best of America. His life and work have left their indelible mark on history, and we all owe John a lot. 
We spent the week paying tribute to this American patriot and selfless public servant. On Monday, I spoke on the Senate floor to pay tribute to my good friend and colleague, and our Senate leadership put together a moving tribute video to honor Senator John McCain and his service. I encourage you to take a couple of minutes to watch. It is available to view online here.

Newspaper Tariffs Reversed
Last month, I testified before the International Trade Commission in a formal hearing to argue against harmful tariffs on Georgia’s newspapers and printing industry. Good news and welcome relief came this week with the commission’s announcement that it would reverse these tariffs.
This news is a victory for the First Amendment, for Georgians, and for all Americans. Georgia’s community newspapers were already feeling the squeeze from technology, but the manipulation of trade remedies was an unnecessary hardship thrust upon our local papers, the commercial printing industry, and the overall U.S. paper manufacturing industry. This action will help keep people informed about relevant news in their communities and end the threat to hundreds of thousands of jobs in the industry.
Trade Negotiations with Mexico
On Monday, President Trump announced that the United States and Mexico have reached a bilateral agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). I’m pleased to see that we’re making progress in modernizing our trade agreements for today’s economy, particularly in the areas of intellectual property and financial services, which are vital for many Georgia job creators.   After Monday’s announcement with Mexico, it is crucial that we now bring Canada into our negotiations to finalize a trilateral agreement. Georgia exports more than $9 billion in goods and services annually to Mexico and Canada combined, and trade supports hundreds of thousands of jobs in our state. Trade is beneficial to America’s long-term economic success, and I hope the administration will move quickly toward a final agreement between our three countries that benefits Georgia farmers, manufacturers, and service providers.

In Other News
	•	On Monday, President Trump nominated Judge J.P. Boulee of Decatur, Ga., to fill a vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in Atlanta. In addition to his service on the Superior Court, Judge Boulee has served our country in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General’s Corps and as an attorney. He has earned his reputation as a fair judge who is hardworking, and he is respected on both sides of the political aisle. I look forward to working with Judge Boulee as his nomination proceeds in the Senate. 
	•	On Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Judge R. Stan Baker, of St. Simons Island, Ga., to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia. Judge Baker is a great and talented Georgian who is well-qualified for this position. His work as a litigator and his service on the bench have provided him with a deep grasp of legal procedure, and his record of distinguished service to our state gives me confidence that he will continue to serve us well. 
	•	On Tuesday, I enjoyed meeting with James Gfrerer who is the nominee to be assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for Information and Technology (IT) and Tamara Bonzanto, the nominee to be assistant secretary of the VA’s Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection. I look forward to chairing their confirmation hearing next Wednesday, Sept. 5.
	•	On Tuesday, It was my honor to administer the oath of commissioning to Major Wes Riddle of Augusta, Ga. Wes earned his master’s degree from the University of Georgia, is a former Kennesaw State University professor and serves in our Georgia National Guard. Wes and his family have my utmost respect and thanks.

￼
	•	While August is typically spent in our home states, this month, we’ve spent much of our time in Washington. We have passed six necessary bills to fund the government and direct our spending in important areas such as defense, health care, education and labor. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act was signed into law to help further modernize America’s military. We’ve confirmed 15 judges and taken the necessary steps to vote on eight more judges and confirmed dozens of other nominations for our government. Additionally, we’re working now to finalize the 2019 Farm Bill passed by the Senate and the House earlier this year to strengthen our agricultural economy in Georgia and the United States.
What’s on Tap?
When the Senate returns next week on Tuesday, Sept. 4, we’re expected to continue work on confirming the president’s nominees. I hope you will all have a safe, enjoyable and happy Labor Day. 
Sincerely, ￼

￼ 
Dear Friend,
It has been great visiting my neighbors around the district this past month. Thank you for your hospitality and informed insight on the issues that matter to you.  It is so important to ensure the highest quality care for America’s heroes at James A. Haley VA Hospital and breaking ground on a new hospital bed tower is another step in the modernization of care for our vets. I was impressed by the compassionate, family-centered and collaborative care environment at Tampa Shriners Hospital for Children also. I received an update from the Hillsborough County State Attorney’s Office, where dedicated professionals are focused on the safety of our families every day. Bay Area Legal Services is an important organization in our community – legal aid is provided to our neighbors, community groups, domestic violence victims, seniors, veterans and children in foster care who do not have the income to hire a private attorney. It was also great sitting down with many of my neighbors in East Tampa and hearing directly from them on the ways we can continue to grow our region’s mobility options and lift everyone up together.
￼
I met with small business owners on the 65th anniversary of the Small Business Association, which funded startups, ideas and growth with more than 300 loans totaling nearly a $160 million investment in small businesses in Hillsborough County last year, leading to the creation of over 1900 jobs. Small businesses should know about the resources offered by the Florida Small Business Development Corporation at USF’s Muma College of Business.
￼
MacDill Air Force Base is central to America’s national security and our local economy, with MacDill-related missions poised to grow and boost Tampa Bay businesses as well. I saw this first hand when I visited CAE USA in Tampa, which houses a KC-135 aircraft simulator that will soon go to MacDill AFB to train pilots at MacDill and across the force.
￼
In August, I honored a great student and community activist: N’Jhari Jackson! I awarded him the Congressional Award – the highest award a member of Congress can bestow upon a youth civilian – for his extraordinary volunteerism and community work!
￼
Almost a year after Hurricane Maria, my Puerto Rico Recovery and Assistance Task Force met to gauge the untiring efforts of so many in our community to assist Puerto Rican families displaced by Hurricane Maria.

8/30/18 14:14,ICYMI: Culberson Op-ed in Houston Business Journal,"￼
     In Case You Missed It...                                                                                                     August 30, 2018 
Culberson Op-ed in Houston Business Journal
 


Dear Neighbor,   This weekend, Congressman Gene Green (TX-29) and I wrote an op-ed featured in the Houston Business Journal on the federal money we secured in the year after Hurricane Harvey, as well as our continued work with state, regional and local officials to find solutions that will strengthen our region’s flood-control network.
You can read the entire op-ed here and below:  
Op-Ed: Federal money can help build a stronger, more resilient Houston Houston Business Journal August 24, 2018 By: Rep. John Culberson  (TX-07) and Rep. Gene Green (TX-29)
One year ago, Houston came to a standstill. Hurricane Harvey made landfall on the Texas coast on August 25 and, over the days that followed, proceeded to dump record amounts of rain on our city, county and region. The devastating floods that followed that rain have become synonymous with Harvey.  
While Houston was experiencing its worst, we saw the best of our Texan spirit. The nation saw our neighborhoods, communities, city, county and state band together to lend each other a helping hand. Whether it was a boat, food, shelter, clothing, or simply a hug or shoulder to cry on, Houstonians and Texans were there for each other. 
As the members of Congress representing the Houston region, we went back to Washington committed to get relief for you – our neighbors and constituents. By remaining united and working with our colleagues from other states and territories that experienced devastating storms, we secured a package of bills to provide $141 billion for the victims of last year’s hurricanes, a large portion of which is headed to Texas. In fact, we wrote the bills in such a way that it put Houston at the front of the line for much of these federal funds. 
Recovery from a storm like Harvey is a long and complex process. It requires coordination at all levels of government to take a multi-pronged approach that addresses the immediate and long-term needs. The funding package we helped secure provides money for short-term needs, like housing, home repair grants, and rental assistance. It also included enough money for the National Flood Insurance Program to meet all claims filed as a result of the 2017 hurricane season. The funding package also addresses long-term projects that will make our region more resilient to flooding in the future, including funding for a comprehensive study of Buffalo Bayou and Tributaries, a regional study of our watersheds.  
We are already seeing the money, for long-term recovery and projects to rebuild a stronger, more resilient city, flow into southeast Texas.   The city, county and state have developed action plans for over $5 billion in Community Development Block Grant – Disaster Recovery funds that will help individuals rebuild. In July, the Army Corps of Engineers also announced federal funding for long-term investment in flood control infrastructure from the hurricane relief bill packages. Texas is receiving nearly $5 billion, and there is enough to finish every federally authorized flood-control project in Harris County at full federal expense. That means the completion of projects on Brays Bayou, Clear Creek, Hunting Bayou and White Oak Bayou will be expedited. The second phase of construction on the Greens Bayou Flood Risk Management Project is also proceeding, with completion expected in 2020. 
The Army Corps of Engineers also announced studies that will investigate potential flood-control projects, which is the first step in further strengthening and expanding our flood-prevention infrastructure. 
Preventing flooding has always been a high priority for us as the federal policymakers for Houston; however, it took on new urgency after Hurricane Harvey, because it created a distinct line of separation: before Harvey and after Harvey. 
We live along the Gulf Coast, on land that is as flat as a pool table, and the reality is we will experience future storms. While we cannot completely eliminate the potential of future flooding, we can work together on solutions to mitigate the risk as much as possible.   While we can all hope and pray that Harvey was a once-in-a-lifetime storm, we must think critically about the future of our flood-control systems and infrastructure to better protect families, homes and businesses.   As your representatives in the federal government, we are in constant contact with our state, regional and local officials to find solutions that will strengthen our flood-control network. Houston came together during the storm, and it will require us to remain united in order to become more resilient to future storms.  

--  It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Sincerely,   ￼  John Culberson

8/30/18 14:08,Notes From The Capital: August 2018,"￼
Improvements to Career and Technical Education Passed into Law
I have some big news to share: provisions I authored to improve career and technical education were included in a bipartisan bill that was recently signed into law. Improving career and technical education has been a focus of mine because I’ve heard time and again that Minnesota businesses too often can’t find workers with the skills they need to fill open jobs. And while not everyone wants or needs to go to a four-year college—everyone should be able to get the skills they need to have a solid, good-paying job. Excellent workforce education provides the foundation for doing so.
My first stop in Minnesota after becoming Senator was at Wyoming Machine, a sheet metal fabricator in Stacy. I heard firsthand about the challenges employers face in finding skilled workers. Since then, I’ve visited K-12 schools, 2-year community and technical colleges, and businesses across Minnesota to learn about the innovative work being done to help prepare students with relevant, modern career and technical education. 
Investing in workforce education is good for students looking for high-skill, in-demand jobs and it's good for employers looking to hire. Signing this bill into law is a welcome step forward.

Helping Students Access Mental Health Services in Schools 
I believe we need to boost access to mental health services, and make sure that our young people can get the treatment they need as early as possible. But about 1 in 5 young people struggle with mental health—and they often have a hard time getting services. 
That’s why this month I introduced a bill to make sure students can access mental health services in schools. Schools are an ideal setting to identify students who need mental health services and quickly connect them with help.
I’m going to fight to see this bill through. It would be a big help for parents and educators alike, while ensuring that students have access to the care they need to succeed.
Learn more here.
Protecting U.S. Troops and Families From Predatory Lenders 
Our nation’s servicemembers work hard to protect us, and I believe that we should do the same in return.
I was incredibly disappointed by news that President Trump’s appointees to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) may roll back protections that prevent servicemembers from being ripped off by shady lenders. I immediately pressed the CFPB to reverse course. 
Allowing shady lenders and scam artists to rip off our troops runs counter to the very mission of the CFPB—to defend Americans who have been harmed by corporate wrongdoing. Curbing protections would put servicemembers at greater risk of things like financial fraud and predatory lending.
I’ll keep fighting to prevent the CFPB from turning its back on our nation’s servicemembers.
Learn more here.  
Working to Lower Prescription Drug Prices 
The high cost of health care—including the skyrocketing price of prescription drugs—is without question the number one issue I hear about from Minnesotans. Too often, families have to choose between health care and other things they need like groceries or paying rent. That is wrong, and that's why I’m doing everything I can to lower health care costs.
I’ll soon be introducing a comprehensive bill to help bring down the cost of prescription medicine. My legislation would allow Medicare to negotiate directly with drug companies to bring costs down, require drug companies to provide more information on what drives drug pricing (because we all deserve to know), and get rid of some of the anti-competitive strategies that big drug companies use to keep prices high and keep lower-cost generics off the market.
This month I also pressed Novartis—a giant pharmaceutical company that generates billions in profits—for answers on their financial and lobbying practices. See, they paid Michael Cohen—formerly President Trump's personal lawyer who recently pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges—nearly $1.2 million through a shell corporation. These payments raise serious concerns that Novartis may have entered into a financial relationship with Cohen to improperly influence the Trump Administration and block policies that lower prescription drug prices. The American people deserve answers, and big pharma's price gouging has to stop.
And I will continue to fight to lower health care costs, because families in Minnesota and across the country deserve relief.

Dear Lindsey,  
Upcoming
Town Hall Dates  
This fall I will hold six town hall meetings throughout Northwest Oregon. Please join me in your community and make your voice heard on the issues that matter to you.

It is an honor to represent NW Oregon in Congress. Every day I serve and with every vote I take, I keep in mind how important it is for Oregonians – especially the next generation – to have a better and brighter future.  
That’s one of the reasons why I focus a lot of my work on education issues, and it’s also why I am outraged that Secretary DeVos and President Trump could allow school districts to divert federal funding meant for mental health services and other school improvements and use it instead to arm teachers. This irresponsible and dangerous proposal will endanger students and rob them of resources that would help them be successful. I’m leading my colleagues in standing up to DeVos and Trump on this issue. But there is also good news from D.C.: Congress took an important step this summer to help students succeed by passing a new career and technical education law that I was proud to help craft. 
￼ 

Building an Economy that Works for Everyone
￼
Although many parts of Oregon’s economy are thriving, not all Oregon families have benefited from the recovery. It’s better for families and our communities when we have an economy that works for everyone, and it’s critical for people to have access to meaningful educational and job training opportunities. I was proud to help bring a $3 million federal investment to the Oregon Manufacturing Innovation Center in Columbia County. OMIC is a transformative partnership that combines job training, higher education, and advanced research and development. This summer I also heard from young people who are finding their place in the world of work through paid internships on the Coast and in the Portland Metro area. Finally, I met with public employees at SEIU who continue to fight for working families and the right to organize. 
 ￼ 

Health Care is a Human Right
￼
Unfortunately, too many Oregonians still struggle with the costs of health care, insurance, and prescription drugs. This summer I met with seniors, patients, health care workers, first responders, and health care executives to discuss what we can do to make health care more affordable and accessible for all. Thank you to AARP members for meeting with me to discuss important issues like how to lower prescription drug costs for seniors, and to the crew at Metro West Ambulance for bringing me along to see firsthand how you care for people in the community. Thank you to hospital administrators and staff for the conversation about the importance of access to care and medicine. And finally, congratulations to Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center on opening a beautiful new clinic in Beaverton that will make our families and communities healthier and stronger. 
￼ 

Our Pledge to Veterans
￼
Veterans have given so much for this country, and they have earned our support when they return to civilian life. I was proud to announce that Easterseals Oregon will receive $1.5M in federal funding over three years to provide employment services for homeless veterans. This funding will expand services to Washington County veterans and will help those who have fallen on hard times gain the skills they need to find employment and escape homelessness. Helping homeless veterans get back to work is good for veterans, their families, our communities, and our economy. 
 ￼ 

Protecting the Environment
￼
Oregonians are known for our respect for the environment. It was wonderful to visit two places in Oregon where local groups are protecting the environment and increasing access to the outdoors. At the mouth of the Columbia River, the Columbia Land Trust is working to restore salmon habitat and create a living laboratory for Clatsop Community College students. In western Washington County, partners are working hard to create the Salmonberry Trail, which will give thousands of people access to beautiful hiking and biking trails across NW Oregon. I’m fighting for Oregon values in D.C. by standing up against the Trump administration’s new dirty power plan and their appalling push to allow offshore drilling off Oregon’s pristine coast. Together we can send the administration a strong message: not on our watch. 
￼ 

Wishing you and your family a safe and happy Labor Day!

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
With over 15,000 lakes and 84,000 miles of rivers and coastline along our two Great Lakes and the Mighty Mississippi, few states have a deeper connection to water than Wisconsin.  
For our waterfront communities - and the Wisconsinites who enjoy visiting them - this connection is not only a vital asset for our quality of life, but also essential to helping support local economies and promote economic opportunity across the state. 
However, yet again this summer our waterfront communities are being threatened by toxic environmental hazards. Harmful algae blooms are clogging our waters, upending plans of anglers, boaters and people out to enjoy the great outdoors all while threatening our robust tourism industry. With Wisconsin’s natural resources supporting nearly $12 billion dollars of economic activity throughout the state, combating algae blooms, protecting water quality and boosting the health of our waterfronts is not just an environmental goal – it is an economic necessity. 
That is why I am taking action in the U.S. Senate to protect Wisconsin’s water resources and support our waterfront communities.  
Wisconsinites who live in waterfront communities and the many businesses that rely on healthy waterfronts need better, faster solutions to address harmful algae blooms and other water quality challenges. So I worked with a bipartisan group of colleagues to pass the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act, which would ensure that Wisconsin communities have the tools to address water quality challenges and identify the local factors contributing to these toxic environmental hazards.  
As many of Wisconsin’s towns and cities along the Great Lakes, rivers and inland lakes were built around their water resources years ago, these communities also face many barriers to revitalizing their waterfronts and planning for future development. 
My Waterfront Community Revitalization and Resiliency Act will support local efforts to take advantage of water resources by attracting water-focused industries and investments that utilize water resources sustainably. This will help our waterfront communities plan for the future and become more resilient to major storms and flooding, all while helping to revitalize neighborhoods and enhance recreation and tourism.  
See why over 50 Wisconsin leaders, regional and national stakeholders have endorsed my Waterfront Community Revitalization and Resiliency Act. 
I am proud to be taking action to safeguard our water resources by authoring the Waterfront Community Revitalization and Resiliency Act and working to pass the bipartisan Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act – and I will continue my work in the Senate to ensure our Great Lakes, rivers, and streams are protected in Wisconsin, today and tomorrow.

8/30/18 13:24,Congressman Harper is Combating the Opioid Crisis ,"￼ 
PROUD TO SERVE MISSISSIPPI’S THIRD DISTRICT 
Dear Friend,
Combating the opioid crisis continues to be a top priority across our country. As Chairman of  #SubOversight, I am proud to stand with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together to find tangible solutions to stop this destructive epidemic from continuing to wreck our nation's communities.    In June, the House of Representatives passed the most significant congressional action against a single drug crisis in history.   H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act, is a bipartisan bill that will help in our overall efforts to combat the opioid crisis. This bill advances treatment and recovery initiatives, improves prevention, protects our communities, and bolsters our efforts to fight deadly illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl.   The underlying text of H.R. 6 includes several Medicaid, Medicare, and public health reforms to help combat the opioid crisis. The policies contained in the bill were advanced by the House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committees.   Here are four ways House Republicans are using legislation to help fight the opioid crisis.  
1. Treatment and Recovery
	•	Improve and expand access to treatment and recovery services
	•	Provide incentives for enhanced care, coordination, and innovation
	•	Establish comprehensive opioid recovery centers
2. Prevention
	•	Encourage non-addictive opioid alternatives to treat pain
	•	Improve data to identify and help at-risk patients and families
	•	Address high prescribing rates while enhancing prescription drug monitoring programs
3. Protecting Communities
	•	Give law enforcement tools to get dangerous drugs out of our communities
	•	Better intercept illicit opioids at international mail facilities
	•	Improve access to federal resources for local communities
4. Fighting Fentanyl 
	•	Better tackle ever-changing synthetic drugs
	•	Crack down on foreign shipments of illicit drugs
	•	Provide grants for local communities to combat fentanyl
For more information, please visit our website here.
I will continue to keep you updated on our efforts to combat the opioid crisis.  

God Bless,

￼

Congressman Al Green’s Statement on Bigoted ‘Monkey This Up’ Comments Made by Florida Republican Gubernatorial Candidate 
(Houston, TX) – On Thursday, August 30, 2018, Congressman Al Green released the following statement regarding the racist comments made by U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis (FL-06), Republican candidate in Florida’s gubernatorial race: 
“I love my country, and my love of country will not allow me to remain silent when there is a moral imperative to speak up and stand up for the great ideals America stands for.  
“The ‘monkey this up’ comments made by Congressman Ron DeSantis aren’t just harmful to any one state or group of people. They are harmful to every state in the United States and every person in our country. They strike at the very heart of the majestic language in our Pledge of Allegiance ‘one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.’ 
“The use of animal imagery to dehumanize African-Americans is as old as the use of that imagery to justify the enslavement of Black people. If not confronted, these dog whistle comments can set the tone and tenor of elections across our Nation. They represent the politics of the segregationist George Wallace when he stood in the schoolhouse door. They are the ‘separate but equal’ politics of Jim Crow. They regrettably and unfortunately are further evidence of the harmful impact of President Trump’s bigotry. 
“The President has set the tone and tenor of political discourse for those who choose to engage in bold bigotry. He has done so: 
	•	By calling the mothers of professional athletes dogs with his ‘s.o.b.’ comments; 
	•	By attacking the I.Q. of a Member of Congress; 
	•	By insisting that there were ‘some nice people’ among the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and bigots in Charlottesville; 
	•	By indicating that certain members of the LGBTQ community should not serve in the military; 
	•	By belittling countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America with his ‘s---hole countries’ comments; 
	•	By attempting to ban Muslims from entering our country; and
	•	By acquiescing to the comments made by Rep. Ron DeSantis, whom he has endorsed as the Republican candidate for governor of Florida.
“Lastly, this statement is not about one election. It’s about whether we will elect to stop this infusion of bigotry into our politics. As we approach this Labor Day holiday, we should fight for a country that honors the contributions of all to make a better life for themselves and their communities.
“I salute Mayor Andrew Gillum for taking the high road of liberty and justice for all. I welcome the criticism of those who would chastise me for exercising the moral imperative to stand up to bigotry.”

Dear Friend,
This August, the Senate has been hard at work on bills that invest in advancing medical research, improving education, and ensuring our troops have what they need to carry out their missions. I’m proud to say both bills include many priorities for our state – you can learn more about the health, education, and workforce priorities here, and the defense priorities here.
While I had to be in the Senate for votes, I was glad I got some time to be back home too. Meeting with Missourians and hearing their views on the direction of our country is a part of this job I always put first. Here are a few of the spots I went to and the people I met along the way:
￼
Poplar Heights Farm
I had the opportunity to take a step back in time when I visited the Poplar Heights Farm in Bates County. Poplar Heights has been painstakingly restored to the 1890s when it was first built. Today it serves as an important tool to teach students about what farm life in Missouri was like in the 19th century.
￼
Hope Spring Freeman Health Center
I’m very proud that our state is leading the country in changing the way behavioral health is treated. Hope Spring, led by Vicky Mieseler, is showcasing this innovative approach by putting all health services, for both physical and behavioral health issues, under one roof.
￼
Faith Community Health 
I was in Branson earlier this month to tour Faith Community Health facilities. Faith Community Health provides affordable health care services for underserved families in the community.
￼
Hirsch Feed & Farm Supply
I visited Hirsch Feed and Farm Supply in Oregon County to talk with owner Larry Hirsch and his employees. They produce an estimated 60,000 tons of feed each year and work hard to ensure Missouri farmers have what they need to feed the world.
￼
South Central Manufacturing
In Summersville, I stopped by South Central Manufacturing. Joe Beasley and his son opened the precision machined parts manufacturing company for business in 1994, they gave me an update on their recent expansion.
￼
Melba Theatre
Built in 1938, the iconic Melba Theatre in Houston has been restored and once again putting on local productions. And no trip to a theatre is complete without candy. 
 
Sincere regards, 
￼

Saying Goodbye to an American Hero
This week, we lost a true American hero. Senator John McCain was a statesman, a veteran, and an individual of unstinting character who served the country he loved with passion, determination, and exuberance. The loss of Senator McCain will be felt deeply throughout the Senate, the country, and by people around the world who were given hope by his call for universal human rights and freedom. He could be both gracious and gruff, but he was always a person of great integrity and moral courage. While I disagreed with John McCain on a number of issues, I never doubted the sincerity of his convictions. He often said that what gave his life meaning was serving causes bigger than himself. He did that. He succeeded in living a life of purpose. He made a difference. I will miss John McCain.  
Supporting Ellicott City 
In May, one of Maryland’s historic treasures, Ellicott City, was hit with its second devastating flood in a two-year period. Yet, again, amid all the chaos and heartbreak, the community has come together to support each other and move forward. We have taken the first steps to help provide relief by securing a federal disaster declaration, and the Small Business Administration is working with shop owners to provide assistance. 
Still, the biggest challenge is to develop and implement a strategy to prevent future floods from having the same devastating impact. 
We know that climate change is generating more extreme weather events like those that hit Ellicott City, and I have proposed federal legislation to address that issue. Unfortunately, the Trump Administration is reversing some of the policies that are already in place to stop the overheating of our planet. 
We cannot, however, allow the lack of progress on climate change at the federal level to stop us from doing everything possible to protect the Ellicott City community. That is why, earlier this month, Senator Ben Cardin and I teamed up with Congressman Elijah Cummings to hold a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee field hearing in Ellicott City to listen to ideas about how to mitigate the damage from future storms. The hearing gave us a much clearer idea of the measures and the resources that will be necessary to confront that challenge. Now we must all come together at the local, state, and federal level to hammer out a comprehensive strategy and identify the resources to implement it. 
The Ellicott City community has inspired us all with its resilience and determination. I know I speak on behalf of all our fellow Marylanders when I say that Ellicott City is not alone. Let’s all work together to get the job done. 
Protecting Democracy
We must protect the integrity of our democratic process. President Trump’s national security team has admitted that the Russians interfered in the 2016 elections and they have predicted that, unless we take action, Putin will do so again in the 2018 midterm election.  That’s why I’ve introduced bipartisan legislation with Republican Senator Marco Rubio to deter Russia – or any other country – from doing just that. It would deter future interference in our elections by imposing automatic, severe economic sanctions on any country caught doing so. Both the Senate Banking Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are in the process of holding hearings on this and other proposals.  
Also right here at home, we learned last month from the FBI that a Russian oligarch with close ties to Vladimir Putin is a significant investor in a firm providing voter registration services for Maryland. I’ve asked the U.S. Treasury and the Department of Homeland Security to investigate what happened in Maryland and take all actions necessary to ensure the integrity of our elections. I’m also working on legislation to make sure this can’t happen again – in our state or anywhere else. Our election infrastructure should never be owned or controlled by foreign adversaries. I will continue working to ensure that Maryland’s – and our country’s – elections systems are protected from attack. 
Fighting for Justice
The person who fills Justice Kennedy's position on the Supreme Court will have a pivotal role in making decisions that will affect every American for generations to come. Whoever has that position will impact countless issues in our country, including health care, a woman's right to choose, civil rights, voting rights, freedom of the press, environmental protections, workers' rights, and the undemocratic flood of secret money in elections. President Trump had an opportunity to pick a mainstream, consensus Supreme Court nominee who could garner broad bipartisan support. Instead, Brett Kavanaugh is a highly ideological and partisan choice. Both the selection process and his record indicate that he cannot be trusted to be a fair and impartial administrator of justice. 
President Trump established a litmus test for any Supreme Court nominee: they had to be willing to overturn key parts of the Affordable Care Act and a woman’s right to reproductive choice. We know Judge Kavanaugh meets that test, or he wouldn’t have been selected. 
Other parts of his record are also deeply troubling. We know Kavanaugh has an extreme view that invests presidents with excessive power and compromises our system of checks and balances. In short, if Kavanaugh were on the Supreme Court, he could be the deciding vote to protect President Trump from the consequences of his wrongdoing. That would be a travesty. 
What’s more, we have only been given access to a fraction of the documents and information we have requested. Republicans have engaged in unprecedented obstruction, refusing to let the American people see the records from a period of time that Kavanaugh served in the White House and which, he has acknowledged, was important to the development of his thinking on key issues. The American people have a right to see these documents. What is the Trump Administration trying to hide?  
People in Maryland and across the country need and deserve a Supreme Court justice who will stand up for liberty and justice for all — not someone pre-selected by right-wing groups who consistently sides with powerful special interests over the rights of workers, consumers, and individuals. Brett Kavanaugh simply does not meet that basic standard, and I will continue to fight his nomination to the Supreme Court. 
Promoting Small Business
Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to join Johns Hopkins University, Morgan State University, the Community College of Baltimore County, and Bloomberg for the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Business Program graduation in Baltimore. The program provides small business owners with practical business education, support services, and access to capital to help them build their businesses and create jobs. Among the 69 entrepreneurs that completed the program were bakers, artisans, engineers, contractors, dentists, and physical therapists. Before the graduation ceremony, I sat down with a number of the business owners. One of the people I spoke with was Robin Belle, the owner of Road Runner Specialty Group, which offers specialty in-home nursing services. Robin launched her business in 2012 when she couldn’t find a nursing job. After this program, she’s decided to launch a wellness-focused consultancy to help people learn to take better care of their health. I also spoke with LaQuicha Brown, who owns the small business Berries by Quicha and made delicious chocolate-covered strawberries for the event. 
It was an honor to participate in the roundtable discussion, deliver remarks at the graduation, and shake the hands of all of the graduates. I’m committed to continuing to work with small business leaders throughout Maryland to make sure they have access to the information, expertise, and credit they need to grow. Whether it’s programs like this or investing in federal agencies like the Small Business Administration, the Economic Development Administration, and the Minority Business Development Agency, I will continue to support programs that can help entrepreneurs achieve their dreams. Our entire community benefits from their success.

8/30/18 11:03,"Rep. Blum Introduces Bipartisan, First-in-the-Nation Federal Second Chance Legislation","￼


August 30, 2018



Rep. Blum Introduces Bipartisan, First-in-the-Nation Federal Second Chance Legislation
WASHINGTON– Representatives Rod Blum (R-IA-01) and Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE-AL) introduced H.R. 6677, the Clean Slate Act – a bipartisan, first-in-the-nation bill that provides a second chance to reformed non-violent drug offenders who face lifelong barriers that hinder opportunities in employment, housing, and education.

According to estimates from the Center for American Progress, roughly 9 in 10 employers, 4 in 5 landlords, and 3 in 5 colleges use background check systems, which can result in a minor record or arrest leading to a life sentence of poverty. By automatically sealing the records of non-violent offenders who have paid their debt to society, this bill will help employers fill the over 6.8 million unfilled jobs in the United States, boost our economy by as much as $87 billion per year, and create opportunities for returning citizens to earn a shot at a happy, healthy, and productive life.

Congressman Blum commented, “Our criminal justice system is in need of reform. Of the 2.3 million estimate of people incarcerated in the U.S., over 1.4 million are serving sentences for non-violent offenses. Data shows that over 76% of released inmates have found it difficult or near impossible to find work after serving their sentence. The issue is cyclical- if we do not remove barriers and create opportunities for these individuals to re-enter society, we are setting them up to fail. Statistically, these individuals are more likely to fall into habitual crime and end up incarcerated once again without jobs and a support system.

I am proud to be introducing the bipartisan Clean Slate Act with my colleague, Representative Blunt Rochester. This bill is a common-sense reform that allows for those who have served their prison sentence for any non-violent and non-sexual offense to have their records sealed, upon petition, so they may re-enter the workforce and become productive members of society. I believe these individuals deserve a clean slate if they meet the requirements we have outlined in this bill, and I am proud to be a part of this critical prison reform effort.” 

“I am honored to introduce this bipartisan legislation, alongside Congressman Blum, because the Clean Slate Act, if enacted, will have a positive impact on millions of families – building a brighter tomorrow that boosts our economy and reforms our out-of-date criminal justice system. It is my sincere hope that this bill will kickstart conversations about Clean Slate and galvanize citizens to press for change in all fifty states,” added Rep. Blunt Rochester.

FreedomWorks Vice President of Legislative Affairs Jason Pye added, ""We thank Reps. Blunt Rochester and Blum for introducing federal ‘clean slate’ legislation. It is no surprise that policies streamlining record sealing have garnered so much attention and support across the country. Congress often lags far behind the states on criminal justice issues. In this case, the introduction of this bill follows Pennsylvania’s enactment of the first state-level clean slate bill. This innovative approach will aid reentry, bolster the workforce, and reduce crime rates, making communities safer and more prosperous.""

Specifically, the Clean Slate Act would:
	•	Automatically seal a person’s federal record if they have been convicted of a nonviolent offense under section 404 of the Controlled Substances Act (this would include misdemeanor drug crimes like simple possession) and any federal nonviolent offense involving marijuana.
	•	Allow individuals to petition the United States Courts to seal records for nonviolent offenses that are not automatically sealed. Currently, there is no system in place to allow individuals to have their record sealed at the federal level unless there is intervention from the President of the United States. 
	•	Direct the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to create a universal form, available over the internet and in paper form, that an individual may use to file a sealing petition.
	•	Create a two-year window for individuals to re-petition the court if their initial request was denied.
The Clean Slate Act will also help to reverse the long-term societal barriers and consequences created by U.S. drug enforcement policy over the past 40 years, while at the same time boost our economy, create jobs, and provide hope to non-violent offenders who paid their debts to society.

Rep. Taylor Travels the Eastern Shore to Discuss Local Priorities, Legislative Accomplishments
￼  Rep. Taylor updates Tangier Island residents on the latest activity in Washington 
Last Friday, I traveled across the Eastern Shore to meet with local elected officials and constituents to hear their concerns about issues facing their communities and to provide a legislative update on the latest news from Washington. 
As someone who grew up on the Eastern Shore, I always enjoy the opportunity to come back and talk with the people and visit the sites that make the Shore one of coastal Virginia’s greatest treasures. Since being elected, my office has been working hard to resolve the issues facing the Eastern Shore, such as expanding child care for military families, supporting Wallops Flight Facility, ensuring that Chincoteague has safe drinking water, and fully staffing our Wildlife Refuges. I also want to thank Mayor Ooker for inviting me to Tangier Island. The new jetty, that is set to begin construction this year, will protect Tangier from erosion and preserve this vital piece of our Commonwealth’s history.

Rep. Taylor Presents Bronze Star to WWII Veteran
￼  Rep. Taylor Presents the Bronze Star to PFC White 
Last week I had the incredible honor to present the Bronze Star Medal to Private, First Class Robert S. White, almost 70 years after his service to our nation in conflicts such as D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge. It was an extremely humbling experience to meet PFC White and shake the hand of someone who has served among the unbroken line of patriots who have risen to every occasion to defend our nation. A big thank-you to the Hampton VA Medical Center, Disabled American Veterans Chapter 13 of Virginia, and my team for making this happen! 

  
Rep. Taylor Co-Sponsors Social Security & Medicare Lock-Box Act
￼ 
I recently signed on as an official co-sponsor of H.R. 1218, the Social Security and Medicare Lock-Box Act, introduced by Representative Tim Walberg (MI-07). This legislation establishes surplus protection accounts in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Funds. The bill further directs the Managing Trustee of each fund to transfer the annual surplus to its respective account and prohibits investing money from the account in any investment vehicle other than U.S. obligations unless otherwise specified by law.
For years I have said we need a lock box on Social Security to prevent any Congress from using our money elsewhere. The same goes for Medicare. These are not just vital retirement programs but a promise from our government that elderly Americans can safely retire with dignity. There has been a longstanding practice in Washington of using Social Security surpluses to pay for other government projects and programs. We owe it to our seniors, and those yet to retire, to keep this program solvent for all Americans, which is exactly what this bill does. 

Rep. Taylor Helps Secure Funding for Army Corps' Project at Sandbridge Beach
￼ 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) recently announced that funding from the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, I strongly supported, would include more than $3 million for Sandbridge Beach and five other projects nationwide. The Bipartisan Budget Act included funding for necessary expenses to address emergency situations at Army Corps of Engineers Projects, and for construction, rehabilitation, and repairs to damage caused by natural disasters.
The Sandbridge Beach Coastal Storm Damage Reduction Project is one such project that has been ongoing since 1998 and is designed to protect against erosion-induced and storm damage by supporting sand replenishment of Sandbridge Beach. The initial nourishment of the beach began in 1998 with maintenance cycles occurring in 2003, 2007, and 2013. Since the completion of the 2013 renourishment, beach profile monitoring of the project site has occurred in the spring and fall of each year. According to the USACE the next cycle is scheduled for 2018. 
In order to ensure the USACE remains on track to conduct their scheduled renourishment of Sandbridge Beach, I contacted Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney and urged him to expedite the process. 
I am grateful for Director Mulvaney's willingness to hear me out about this issue. Replenishing Sandbridge Beach is an important project that supports the City of Virginia Beach, its citizens, and businesses by helping to protect the shoreline from future erosion and storm damage. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the projects they support are vital to keeping coastal Virginia clean and safe, which is why keeping this project on schedule is vitally important. I am grateful and honored to have played a part in helping move this project forward to get results for the people in my district. 

Rep. Taylor Tours General Dynamics NASSCO
￼  Rep. Taylor speaks with General Dynamics employees about their economic impact on Virginia's Second District 
I had a great in-depth tour at General Dynamics NASSCO shipyard in Norfolk this week, learning about their challenges and meeting their wonderful workers. Ship repair is a huge part of our local economy and an essential part of our nation’s defense industrial base. We have led the charge in Congress to reform the culture of using continuing resolutions, something done for over a decade, and damaging to national security and our area.

8/30/18 9:01,Gearing Up for the New School Year,"
 
￼

 Dear Friend, 
As we approach Labor Day Weekend and our children get ready to head back to school, I wanted to share a few education-related resources that might be of interest to you. 
In Maryland, we are fortunate to have one of the best education systems in the nation. And in Congress, I will fight to keep it that way by making sure our state receives its fair share of federal resources. 
Below, I've included some information about educational opportunities for students and about Congressional efforts to keep education affordable. I hope you'll find this information helpful.
I wish you and your family a safe and healthy start to this new school year and encourage you to contact my office in Towson at (410) 832-8890 if I can be of service to you. 

K-12 Education 
	•	Improving the ESEA. The Department of Education continues to implement the bipartisan law that reauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and replaces the widely criticized No Child Left Behind Act. The Every Student Succeeds Act contains a number of reforms that will provide students with a high-quality, twenty-first century education. Not only does it avoid an overzealous focus on ""teaching to the test,"" but it also includes a provision I authored in the No Child Left Inside Act that will bolster environmental education programs for students in Maryland and around the country. Moving forward, I will continue to hold the Department of Education and Secretary Betsy DeVos accountable to ensure that they fully implement the Every Student Succeeds Act. And I remain committed to making sure that Maryland's schools, teachers and students have the resources they need to meet our state's educational goals.  
	•	High School Art Competition. Each spring, the U.S. House of Representatives sponsors a nationwide high school art competition. Students from each Congressional District can enter their artwork for a chance to have it displayed in the U.S. Capitol for one year. Open to all high school students, the contest is an opportunity to recognize artistic talent from across the nation and spur student interest in the arts. For more information about the competition, see here or contact my office at (410) 832-8890.   
	•	U.S. Service Academies. Each year, I am privileged to nominate qualified candidates from Maryland to the U.S. service academies, including the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Military Academy and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. To apply for a nomination for the class of 2023, see here. Completed application packets are due to my office by 5 p.m. on Friday, October 19, 2018. Incomplete and late applications will not be considered. For more information, visit: https://sarbanes.house.gov/services/students/military-academy-nominations.  
	•	Making It Easier to Save for Your Children's Future. Recent changes to federal tax law have made it easier for families to enjoy tax-advantaged saving for their children's education. 529 savings plans -- formerly reserved only for use in higher education -- can now be used for K-12 education and beginning this year, families can use up to $10,000 in 529 plan pre-tax dollars to help pay for private elementary school and private high school costs. 

Higher Education 
	•	Keeping College Affordable. As our children enter a workforce that increasingly demands a college degree, many working families continue to struggle with the surging costs of higher education. Congress is working with colleges and universities to find ways to combat the increasing cost of tuition. As part of this effort, colleges are now reporting to Congress on the causes of tuition increases and must provide students with fair and full information about their borrowing options when taking out and repaying student loans. As a national leader in strengthening student financial literacy, the State of Maryland is also implementing curriculum requirements to provide instruction on the subject for all students in grades 3-12.  
	•	Strengthening Financial Aid Programs. Congress passed legislation to simplify and streamline the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) process -- the primary mechanism to access federal financial aid for education -- into an easy-to-navigate, two-page form. Congress has also expanded opportunities for students to access financial literacy and support services. In addition, we are providing tuition assistance to students who commit to teaching in public schools in high-poverty communities or to teaching high-need subject areas. I remain committed to increasing the size, duration and year-round eligibility of Pell Grant awards, so that millions of eligible students can take advantage of need-based federal financial aid for college.  
	•	Supporting Our Servicemembers and Veterans. Congress is honoring the service of our military families by expanding the Post 9/11 GI Bill program so that veterans have more flexibility. We have also established a scholarship program for the children and spouses of active-duty servicemembers and veterans.   
	•	Making Student Loan Repayment Affordable. Many who are fortunate to earn a degree still grapple with student loan debt long after they graduate. This debt burden often forecloses many career options and delays major purchases like cars and homes, which in turn produces a drag on the national economy. To address this issue, I authored a law creating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, which forgives remaining student loan debt for those who have made loan payments for 10 years while employed full-time in public service. Those eligible for PSLF include teachers, first responders, health professionals, civil servants, public interest attorneys and many others in nonprofit jobs. For more information, visit: studentloans.gov/repay. 

Additional Resources 
	•	Contact the U.S. Department of Education's Federal Student Aid division by visiting www.studentaid.ed.gov or by calling 1-800-4-FED-AID.  
	•	The nonprofit Institute for College Access and Success -- Project on Student Debt provides supplementary material about PSLF: www.ibrinfo.org.  
	•	The Federal Student Aid Ombudsman, 1-877-557-2575, can assist with the resolution of borrowers' repayment issues.  
	•	The National Consumer Law Center's Student Loan Borrower Assistance is an additional resource to guide individuals through the repayment process: www.studentloanborrowerassistance.org. 
 Sincerely,  ￼ John P. Sarbanes Maryland's Third Congressional District

Dear Friend, 
Thomas Jefferson once said, “The government closest to the people serves the people best.” 
I believe he is absolutely right. There’s a reason why the information, regulations, and rules coming out of Washington, D.C. don’t always match reality. 
Recently, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced that they intend to move more of their operations closer to the people by relocating the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture out of our nation’s capital saving money and operating closer to the people they serve. As a result, these agencies are now searching for their new location. 
This is a step in the right direction by the Trump Administration. It makes no sense for federal government agencies whose core functions are to serve the rural population to be packed into expensive buildings in the Washington, D.C. metro area, costing us more and potentially benefiting us less. 
The Economic Research Service looks at trends and emerging issues in agriculture, food, the environment and rural America. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture invests in initiatives that ensure the long-term viability of agriculture. I can’t think of a location better than Missouri to carry out those missions. 
That’s why I joined with my colleagues Reps. Vicky Hartzler and Emanuel Cleaver to lead a bipartisan effort to suggest that Kansas City would be the perfect location. 
The USDA has already recognized that they function better outside of Washington, DC by previously relocating the Risk Management Agency (RMA) and the Food Safety Administration (FSA) to Kansas City. Kansas City has a talented workforce and a lower cost-of-living that is higher quality. 
Additionally, we are a transportation hub for the Midwest and you can’t get much more centrally located in the United States than Kansas City. 
I believe the USDA recognized what we already knew when they relocated the RMA and the FSA here. For those same reasons, we are well-positioned to attract these other agencies. 
No doubt this would be a boon to our economy bringing more jobs to the area, but I’m excited that even more core functions related to agriculture will be much closer to the people. 
As your Congressman, I will continue to work with my colleagues and local stakeholders to provide critical information for the USDA to make their final relocation decision. I believe we have the perfect location for these quality jobs and hope that we are successful in bringing them to Kansas City. 

Sincerely,
￼ 
Sam Graves

Carper's Connection
August 29, 2018 
Dear Friend, 
Republicans are working overtime to keep information on President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, hidden from the public.   Currently, Senate Republicans are refusing to release hundreds of thousands of documents on Brett Kavanaugh’s record. Specifically, they are withholding documents from Kavanaugh’s time as White House counsel during the Bush Administration.  
￼
This type of suppression is unprecedented. How are we, as Senators, supposed to carry out our constitutional duty of advice and consent on this president’s Supreme Court nominee without vital information on his career? Even Brett Kavanaugh himself referred to his time in the White House as “the most instructive.” That should be enough in and of itself to allow us to see these crucial documents.   Are they afraid of the what we already know? What we’ve seen is that Brett Kavanaugh will work to bolster corporations over people and gut some of the most fundamental American rights. How do we know this? His judicial record.   And if his public record is this bad, imagine what they’re working so hard to hide from us.   If we’re considering a lifetime appointment, the American people deserve the whole picture.   It’s why on Friday, as the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, I demanded all documents related to Brett Kavanaugh’s environmental record from Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
I also led a group of my colleagues on the Senate floor to sound the alarm on his dangerous agenda. 
We must see Brett Kavanaugh’s full record, and I’ll continue fighting to make sure that we do. Too much is stake.

13th Annual Eagle Scout Ceremony
I had the privilege of hosting the 13th Annual Eagle Scout Recognition Ceremony at the Boy Scouts of America Headquarters in Irving. Since this event’s creation, over 500 Eagle Scouts in the 24th District have been recognized for their outstanding community service and commitment to Scouting. The young men who have achieved the rank of Eagle Scout have exhibited integrity, bravery, and fidelity in their pursuit of the Boy Scouts of America’s highest award. It is a privilege to recognize these outstanding young men as they reach the pinnacle of their scouting career. I look forward to hearing of their continued achievements in life.

8/29/18 17:16,Trump Policies Exacerbate Income Inequality Instead of Lifting Up Working Families," 
A message from Senator Michael Bennet
￼ 

Friends, 
This week, I spoke up in response to reports from Bloomberg and the Associated Press showing wages have decreased for working Americans, despite President Trump’s promises of relief for the middle class. 
Right now, more than 50% of children stand to earn less income than their parents. That is unacceptable. 
But instead of addressing income inequality in our country, President Trump passed a tax cut and created a trade war that exacerbate it. 
The test for a healthy economy is not how well the stock market is doing. It’s whether working people can afford housing, health care, higher education, and day care. We should be working to make it easier for families to afford these important costs of living—not harder. 
I encourage you to watch and share the video on Facebook or YouTube.

Thanks, ￼  Michael

WRAPPING UP THIS AUGUST WORK PERIOD...
 I attended the Georgia Chamber of Commerce Congressional Luncheon where I participated in a Military Breakout Session with my fellow Georgia Representative, Congressman Sanford Bishop (GA-02). 
￼
We had an impactful, bipartisan discussion about how the military bases in Georgia affect our communities statewide, as well as Congress’ efforts to set bold priorities for our nation’s military and support the brave men and women in uniform.
In Evans, I joined the Columbia County Rotary Club meeting to give an update on what we have accomplished during the 115th Congress and take some questions about important issues affecting our country and communities. 
￼

Thanks for having me!

8/29/18 16:04,Crucial health care survey:,"￼ 
Hello Lindsey - As a doctor, I know many people in our community are concerned about the future of their health care and rising costs.

After President Trump tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the Administration made several decisions regarding how it’d implement the law. These actions — from undermining protections for people with preexisting conditions that make sure everyone- whether you are sick or healthy- can get health insurance coverage, to ending payments that lower deductibles and out-of-pocket costs — are sabotaging our nation’s health care system.

Do you support continuing protections for pre-existing conditions?

· Yes: Keep pre-existing conditions protections and work to make the Affordable Care Act better.

· No: I support the President’s approach.

· Other / I don’t know.

Listening to you is my most important job. Please click to take my survey and to join my email updates.

Nobody should have to worry that one unexpected medical bill could threaten his or her future. That’s why instead of repealing or undermining the Affordable Care Act, which would kick millions off their health care and raise costs1, I supported the first bipartisan plan to fix what isn’t working and to make it better. Unfortunately, not everyone has taken that approach.

People in both parties must focus on real solutions to address the health care challenges people are facing. I’ve introduced a Prescription to Protect Our Care to put forward real solutions: http://bit.ly/RxtoProtectOurCare. It means stabilizing the health insurance marketplaces, lowering costs, and protecting people with pre-existing conditions. I’ve also introduced two new bills to expand coverage and lower costs.

Do you support continuing protections for pre-existing conditions?

· Yes: Keep pre-existing conditions protections and work to make the Affordable Care Act better.

· No: I support the President’s approach.

· Other / I don’t know.

Listening to you is my most important job. Please click to take my survey and to join my email updates.

Health care isn’t about politics – it’s about people’s lives. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Be well,
￼
Ami Bera, M.D.

Picnic Food and Better News
This piece originally appeared in the Highland County Press.

In late June, President Trump canceled a picnic and reporters in Washington were captivated by the fate of the picnic foods. Who would eat the already-cooked steaks? Had the potato salad gone missing? What was the status of the coleslaw?

The good news is that all the food went to a well-deserved lunch for our veterans at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

The bad news is that the national media sometimes reports interesting events from the capital rather than important events. A major missed story from that same day: The House of Representatives finished a vote marathon on over 70 bills aimed at fighting the opioid crisis.

I came to Congress to deliver results exactly like that opioid legislation. Ohioans deserve to know what their representatives have accomplished for them, even when clickbait issues like missing foodstuffs dominate the headlines. To that end, here is the good news – and the facts – from Washington.

Last winter, we passed the biggest economic news for our nation in a generation: Tax reform. It’s clear that our economy is strong and getting stronger. Unfortunately, media coverage of tax reform focuses on the reactions of pundits and politicians rather than the actual effects on the American people. 

Unlike pundits’ claims that tax reform is only for the wealthy, it’s important to note that Congress took specific steps to ensure that nobody gets left behind. The IRS reported that about 90 percent of workers saw an increase in take-home pay since the new law went into effect. 

Thanks to tax reform, 45 recently designated “Opportunity Zones” stretching from Cincinnati to Portsmouth are spurring investment in economically distressed communities. Over 1.3 million jobs have been created since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law and, amazingly, there are more jobs in America than there are job seekers. That’s not just talk, that’s food on the table and money in your pocket.

We’ve also taken significant steps to make our communities safer and stronger. Ohio has been disproportionately affected by the opioid crisis. In June alone, the House passed over 70 bills geared toward combating fentanyl, addressing prescription practices, and getting drugs off our streets. 

Over $32 million is coming directly to Ohio for prevention, treatment, and recovery services, and we have invested $2.3 billion in mental health services, training, and school safety programs. Several years ago, I wrote that human trafficking in Ohio was as easy as ordering a pizza. Thanks to recent legislation championed by Sen. Rob Portman, online advertising for sex trafficking has decreased more than 60 percent.

As an active-duty Army Reserve member and veteran of the Iraq War, a major reason I ran for Congress was because people who had never served in our armed forces were making decisions about our military and veterans. Fortunately, now things are moving in the right direction. Just this year, we gave our troops the biggest raise in nearly a decade. 

For the over 45,000 veterans in our district, we’re making major structural changes to the Department of Veterans Affairs, putting our veterans first, and we just permanently removed time restrictions on GI Bill benefits for recent veterans.

There’s still so much more to accomplish this fall, from protecting middle-class and small business tax cuts, to reducing drug costs, and closing the skills gap to get even more workers where they want to be – producing. While the list of “more to do” may seem endless, and headlines from Washington don’t reflect all that we have done, know that this is a Congress that is working for you.

Have a question about upcoming legislation? Give my office a call at (513) 474-7777. We’re happy to help.

8/29/18 14:00,VICKY'S VIEW: The Best & Worst,"
￼ 





Dear Friend, 
Last week I had the chance to see the best and worst of humanity when I traveled to Poland as part of a Congressional delegation. 
  
  
￼ 
Enjoying my visit with the Battle Group Poland in Orzysz, Poland. 
  
  
Some of the best of humanity came in seeing our U.S. troops stationed in Poland, partnering with a multinational group called the “Battle Group Poland” to act as a deterrent to regional aggression.
  
  
￼  
I met with the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which is leading multinational exercises with our allies in Poland to act as a deterrent against regional aggression. 
  
￼   ￼ 
I had the opportunity to meet with U.S. troops from Missouri, too, while I was in Poland. On the left, I am pictured with Captain Woolery. 
  
I met with Mission Commanders and Poland’s Deputy Minister of Defense Tomasz Szatkowski, visited with troops from Missouri, and saw some of the equipment they use in their training.
  
￼ 
A Stryker that has been newly outfitted with a 30mm gun turret that Congress recently approved. 
  
The 2nd Cavalry Regiment is currently leading the multinational exercises, and they are the only U.S. Army unit with Strykers (eight-wheeled armored fighting vehicles) outfitted with new 30mm gun turrets that Congress recently approved. This new equipment will give them the more firepower when confronted by an aggressor.
  
The Battle Group is located in Orzysz, near the Suwalki Gap, a land strip that touches Northeastern Poland, Belarus, Lithuania and Kaliningrad, Russia. Its locale sends a powerful message to those nearby who might want to invade Poland’s borders: that we and our allies stand strong with Poland against invasion.
  
In World War II, Poland was invaded by not one, but two of its neighbors within 16 days: the Germans from the west and the Russians from the east. As a result, its people were overrun by Hitler’s Nazis who moved to exterminate the Jews in concentration camps and systematically carry out unspeakable horrors - an example of the worst of humanity.
  
￼ 
As we arrived to Auschwitz - Birkenau, we approached this sign describing what happened there. 
  
I had the opportunity to visit two of these concentration camps at Auschwitz, which is comprised of three separate camps within a span of a few miles. The original camp was like a small city with rows of 2-3 story brick barracks and headquarter buildings. Prisoners were worked to death or tortured for minor infractions here. Birkenau, the second camp, was mainly for extermination. Here, trains brought in thousands of innocent people who were marched off to the gas chambers within minutes of their arrival. Thirty percent of them were given work assignments and housed in squalid conditions in barracks. This complex held over 100,000 people.  We did not tour the third site.
  
￼ 
The famous sign at the entrance of the Auschwitz Concentration Camp, featuring the deceptive German phrase, “Work sets you free.” 
  
￼ 
The barbed wire at the edge of the Auschwitz Concentration Camp that contained the prisoners. 
  
￼ 
One of the train cars that would transport Jews to the Birkenau extermination camp. Jews from as far as Greece and Hungary were shipped here to die. 
  
￼ 
One of the guard stands where Nazis could survey the camp to ensure no one was allowed to escape. 
  
 ￼ 
The entrance to Birkenau. Nearly half of the 6 million European Jews who died in WWII died in Poland. 
  
 ￼ 
What's left of one of the gas chambers at Auschwitz, which was blown up and burned by the Germans before they fled at the end of the war. 
  
 ￼ 
A Hall of Remembrance to commemorate the innocent Jewish lives that were murdered by an evil regime. 
 
￼ 
The Congressional delegation that visited Auschwitz (L-R): Congressman Brian Babin, Congressman John Moolenaar, me, Holocaust survivor Ed Mosberg, From the Depths Founder Jonny Daniels, Congressman Steve King, and Congressman Barry Loudermilk. 
  
Auschwitz-Birkenau was one of many concentration camps that Nazis designed to provide forced labor for Hitler’s projects and to exterminate Jews, Pols, Russian prisoners of war, gypsies and the many Polish Christians who sheltered endangered Jews. In total, 6 million Jews were killed in Europe during the war. Conservative estimates show that almost half of them, nearly 3 million, were slaughtered in Poland. One person we met while there shared that you cannot go 2 kilometers in Poland without finding the site of a mass grave.  It’s hard to imagine such an injustice, but it happened.
  
The stories from this dark time were made all the more personal by the meetings I had with individuals who were personally affected by the Holocaust. 
  
I met Edward Mosberg, a 92-year-old Polish-born American citizen who was sent to the Plaszow concentration camp as a boy with his parents and sisters. Edward was the only one in his family to survive, losing a total of 60 relatives to the gas chambers. Edward’s wife, who was sent to Auschwitz, was the only one in her family (besides her father) to survive the camp and two brutal death marches. Edward and his wife eventually moved to America, established a business, raised three children and now enjoy seven grandchildren. They represent the best of humanity in their determination to survive as they share their story and carry on despite the trials they have endured.
 ￼ 
I also visited Sister Franciszkanki (pictured above), who belongs to a Warsaw convent which saved over 500 children during the War. Parents smuggled their children out of a Jewish ghetto into the convent, where the nuns connected them to an underground system where they escaped out of Poland. In addition, I met Julian Kulski, son of the Mayor of Warsaw during the German occupation, who helped forge thousands of documents for Jews so they could safely escape the country. He risked his life, and the life of his family, so others might live.
  
￼ 
The Warsaw Zoo, where over 300 Jews were saved during the war. The secret tunnel (above) connected to the house basement with a nearby bird cage so children could escape during Nazi raids on the house. They were never discovered.
  
I also heard the story of Jan and Antonina Zabinski, a couple who directed the Warsaw Zoo and saved hundreds of Jewish citizens by hiding them in their home and the zoo itself and then getting them to safety outside of Poland. They were raided by Nazis many times, never caught, and successfully rescued many. Their story is the basis for the 2017 movie, “The Zookeeper’s Wife.”
 
Individuals like the nuns, the Warsaw Mayor’s son, and the Zabinskis are called “the righteous” in Poland now. They are an example of the best in humanity. They risked their lives to protect others - the purest example of the Golden Rule.
 
The witnessing of their memory and the rebirth of their nation, Poland, was inspiring to see. The countryside is beautiful, their military is strong, and its leadership is committed to democracy, free enterprise, and investing in national defense. The nation’s businesses are growing, the economy is thriving, and the people are charting a new course for their nation based on freedom, capitalism, and education. Poland is one of our closest allies and a strong example of what can happen when a resilient people dedicates itself to a renewal of freedom, respect, and appreciation for all its citizens.
 
I am thankful for the opportunity to experience this rebirth of a nation and strengthen relationships with military and civilians of this most important ally to the United States. I look forward to a continued strong partnership with this important nation.
 
Yours in service,
￼

8/29/18 13:48,Lowering Rx Drug Costs,"View this e-mail in your browser.

￼ 


For anyone who has struggled with a chronic condition like high blood pressure or depression – or had a loved one diagnosed with cancer or Parkinson’s – you know affording your prescription drugs feels like, not just a matter of health – but a matter of wealth.
￼  Watch to learn how my CREATES Act would help bring more generics to the market.  
John and Barbara from Randolph know this all too well.  To afford the $1,600 a month for his Parkinson’s medication, they were forced into bankruptcy and foreclosure.  Bill and Teri from Mountainside, NJ, spend $18,000 a month on the medications Bill needs to fight lung cancer.  And Kelli from Park Ridge, NJ has a son with hemophilia whose medication – that he will need for the rest of his life – is a staggering $60,000 a month.    
￼ 
Just about everyone knows people like John and Barbara, or understands personally what it’s like for Bill and Teri.  Or can imagine the fear Kelli faces every day worrying about her son.     Jeffrey Graciano, a Pharmacist in Weehawken, works with doctors and insurance companies every day to help his customers get their life-saving prescriptions, but even then, he told me, “they still cost thousands of dollars a month.”   This cannot keep happening in the greatest nation in the world.   And it’s pretty clear — especially after the Trump corporate tax cuts — that drug companies can afford to lower costs, but that doesn’t mean that they’ll do the right thing.   I believe we can do something in Washington to help lower the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs. Here is just some of what I’ve been working on: 
	•	Cap how much patients pay for their medication - That's right, I believe there should be a limit on your out-of-pocket costs for life-saving medication. That's why I support the Capping Prescription Costs Act, which caps drug copays at $250 a month for individuals. No American should have to spend their life savings just so they can go on living. It's as simple as that.  
￼
After talking with NJans struggling with skyrocketing prescription drug costs, I described a few solutions I’m working on in the short term to tackle the problem. Listen. 
	•	Bring Cheaper Generics to Market – Some big drug companies play fast and loose with the rules to keep more affordable generics off the market. I introduced the CREATES Act to crack down on companies that put profits over patients and put up illegal roadblocks to cheaper versions of their drugs. Watch my video on how this works.   
	•	Hold Drug Companies Accountable for Price Gouging –The SPIKE Act would force pharmaceutical companies who jack up prices on life-saving drugs to disclose their reasons why to the public.     
	•	Stop Insurance Companies from Hiding Lower Cost Drug Options – This one made me the most upset when I found out about it. Health insurance companies often use gag clauses to ban your pharmacist from telling you if it’s  cheaper to pay out of pocket than to use your insurance! I’ve cosponsored the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act and the Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018 to stop this.    
In the richest country on earth, no family should be faced with bankruptcy to afford the cost of prescription drugs.  No patient should be forced to choose between the medication they need and the home they live in.  And no mother should worry their child may never have the resources s/he needs to live a long life, independently.     
That’s the kind of country I’m fighting for.

Dear Lindsey,
Yesterday, I had the honor of celebrating Women’s Equality Day at the New York Stock Exchange, where I was joined by some amazing New York women to ring the closing bell. As we commemorate 98 years of the 19th Amendment and a woman’s right to vote, we are also reminded of the work still left to do. 
￼
Congresswoman Maloney releasing the ""Earn Less, Pay More"" report.
That is why yesterday I also released a new report, titled “Earn Less, Pay More: The State of the Gender Pay Gap and ‘Pink Tax’ in 2018,” which explores the economic inequalities that American women still face today. This report shows that while we have been successful in combatting some gendered pricing, women still pay more than men for too many goods and services. Add this “pink tax” to the gender pay gap, and women are facing economic inequalities that we should never have to deal with.
But, we can fix this. We must pass the Equal Rights Amendment. By enshrining women’s rights and equality in our Constitution we will have the legal bedrock we need to fight the gender pay gap, sexual harassment and assault, and gendered pricing. 
￼
Congresswoman Maloney and New York leaders at the NYSE Closing Bell.
By finally passing the ERA we can make history and create a more equitable world for generations to come. I won’t rest until we do. 
In solidarity,
￼

Member of Congress

NEWS FROM WASHINGTON AND ACROSS WEST TEXAS
Dear Friends, 
What would this country be without regions like ours that feed and clothe the American people and fuel this great economy? What we do in rural America is critical to our nation’s economy and security. Rural prosperity was the focus of our discussions in the district last week – from ensuring we have critical infrastructure like broadband and healthcare, to building on the successes we have seen from tax and regulatory relief so that we can continue to create new jobs and grow our economy in small towns across this country.   
The Strength of Rural America  
Last week, I hosted over 70 community leaders from across our region to discuss issues affecting our region including the opioid epidemic, rural healthcare, and economic development. Anne Hazlett, Assistant to the Secretary for Rural Development at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was gracious enough to give the keynote speech. The goal of our summit was to work together as a broader community of towns and counties throughout West Texas to address the challenges we face in rural America and to work collectively at all levels to make sure that we have not just viable communities, but thriving rural communities. We want a prosperous future for our small towns because they may be little, but they are filled with people who have big hearts and big dreams and they make a huge contribution to this great country. I am confident that together we can tackle the unique challenges rural America faces and pave the way for an even brighter West Texas.
See here for FOX34’s coverage of the event.  
￼
A major topic of discussion during our summit was the opioid crisis, which unfortunately, has impacted communities across our nation, from concrete jungles to the plains of rural America. To combat the epidemic, Congress has passed over 70 pieces of legislation that address all sides of this issue from recovery to research aimed at prevention. We’ve made some headway, but we have a ways to go. Read KAMC’s write-up on this part of the summit here.  
￼ 
The B-21, “Raider” 
Last week, I led a letter to Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson urging the Air Force to select Dyess as the training base for the B-21. I, along with the other members of the Texas delegation who signed onto the letter, are confident that Dyess will do an exceptional job as the training base for the B-21 Raider. Dyess’ long history as a bomber training base and its extensive assets make it an outstanding training base for the B-21. Moreover the Abilene community has been recognized year-after-year for its excellent support for the fine men and women who serve at Dyess and their families. Read our letter here. 
￼￼ 
  
A Helping Hand 
I had the opportunity to visit with volunteers and employees over at South Plains Food Bank. They showed me around their facility, and told account after account of the impact they have made. I was so impressed by their commitment to selflessly serve our community and care for our neighbors in need. They are sincere, big hearted and true West Texans. 
￼ 
Please know, it is an honor to be your Representative. Feel free to reach out to my office and let me know how I can best serve you.

A BUSY DISTRICT WORK PERIOD
Dear Friends, 
I have been enjoying a busy District Work Period and the chance to meet with constituents. Among other activities, I visited the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard to see all the work being done there to improve the facility. I met with various groups in my office and visited two community health centers. I helped deliver Meals on Wheels, and I toured L3 Insight Technology, a Londonderry company that’s manufacturing the next generation of night vision goggles and equipment for our warfighters. I was honored to help present the John Moakley Award for Exemplary Public Services to my Director of Constituent Services Elise Britton. I attended a Girl Scouts NASA Partnership Star Party and visited Camp Spinnaker Asthma Camp in Tuftonboro. I saw an oyster farm in Little Bay that’s benefiting from research conducted by the NH Sea Grant program, a NOAA/UNH partnership that receives federal support. I also went to Pease Air National Guard Base where I received an update from our New Hampshire National Guard. 
Visiting the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard 
 Earlier this month, I toured the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNS) and received a briefing from the Shipyard command. Several construction projects are currently ongoing to expand the Shipyard’s capacity to modernize and repair Virginia-class and Los Angeles-class attack submarines. 
￼ 
After the tour, I met with union leaders to discuss workforce issues at the Shipyard and the importance of careers in trades. PNS is aiming to hire nearly 800 workers, both to replace retiring workers and to increase the Shipyard’s capacity so that its work will continue to be completed in a timely manner. One of the primary challenges facing the Shipyard is the shortage of skilled workers. 
￼ 
We should be encouraging young people to consider going into trades. There are programs that allow people to get a degree and learn a trade, which can lead to a very lucrative and fulfilling lifelong career. For too long, work in the trades has been disrespected. Encouraging new workers to go into careers in the trades is essential both for our economy and our national security. We just enacted important legislation, which I helped pass out of the Education and Workforce Committee, to reauthorize career technical education programs, and there are fantastic efforts underway to unite stakeholders like unions, the government, and institutions of higher education to bring more young people into careers in the trades.
Urging the new VA Secretary to take action to implement the New Hampshire VA Task Force recommendations 
Last Tuesday, I joined the New Hampshire delegation in sending a letter to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, who just took over the agency, asking him to take action to improve the Manchester VA and to come to Manchester to visit the facility. 
In the letter, we wrote, “Veterans in New Hampshire face a number of challenges when attempting to access VA services. These challenges include the lack of a full-service VA hospital, the difficulties of finding health care in rural areas, and the deteriorating condition of the infrastructure at the Manchester VA Medical Center (VAMC). The Boston Globe last year detailed serious allegations of unsafe practices and administrative indifference at the facility. The Task Force released its final report in June, including 29 recommendations for actions to improve VA services in Manchester. Many of the recommendations reflect priorities we have long supported, such as improving mental health and pain management services to prevent substance misuse; expanding access to telehealth care; creating a comprehensive ambulatory surgical care center; strengthening ties between the Manchester VA and nearby medical schools and other institutions of higher education; and expanding services for women veterans, who are an important, growing population with unique needs. The key now will be ensuring that these recommendations are quickly and effectively implemented.” 
Visiting the Manchester Community Health Center 
I recently toured Manchester Community Health Center (MCHC) and held a roundtable with the facility’s leadership to discuss the challenges they face in delivering services. The MCHC is one of the top-rated federally qualified health centers in the country, serving 13,000 patients last year. The health center treats an average of 200 new patients each month.  
The providers and staff at MCHC have a very difficult job. They are incredibly dedicated, but they face a number of challenges providing the services patients need. We must support federally qualified health centers like MCHC. They help so many adults and children access good health care, and they are also critical in our state’s fight to turn the tide in the opioid crisis. 
Many of the challenges MCHC faces relate to services the facility provides that are not reimbursable. The Center is unable to bill Medicaid for a number of the services it provides, instead relying on its small revenue stream to be able to continue providing these services at little to no cost to the patient. While beneficial for patients, using its own revenues while operating with extremely small margins puts MCHC at long-term risk and highlights the necessity of stable federal funding. 
Hosting a reception for participants in the Veterans History Project 
The Veterans History Project collects veterans’ personal stories of serving in the military. The collection includes personal narratives that have been recorded, correspondence, and visual materials. I was honored to spend some time with so many American heroes. Their stories are a part of our nation’s history, and now they will be preserved forever in the Library of Congress. Through the testimony of these veterans, Americans can learn and better appreciate the sacrifice of our veterans and what it means for our nation to be at war and peace. Serving our veterans and the people of the First District has been the privilege of a lifetime. I am forever grateful for the sacrifice of our veterans, and I know every person who hears these stories will feel the same.
Former Executive Councilor Dudley Dudley interviews the veterans for my office and submits their stories to the Library of Congress. Dudley has collected hundreds of stories. The library has over 500 stories submitted by veterans from across the state. 
￼
Participating in a ride-a-long with St. Joseph Community Services’ Meals on Wheels program 
No one in our country should have to go without food, but far too many low-income or vulnerable seniors struggle to meet their daily nutrition needs. With over four million seniors living below the poverty line, Meals on Wheels programs in New Hampshire and across the country are vital for people who are homebound or may need help getting a hot meal. Thank you St. Joseph Community Services (SJCS), and all the fantastic organizations that operate Meals on Wheels programs. So many rely on SJCS and your hard work. I am truly grateful for all that SJCS does to serve our seniors who need a little help getting a hot meal. 
￼ 
Investigating oversight of Defense Department contractors at sites where open burning is used to dispose of toxic waste from munitions and ordinance
The Department of Defense Inspector General (DoD IG) announced that they have agreed to my request and will conduct an investigation to evaluate the Department of Defense’s (DoD) compliance with “relevant environmental and related laws, inter-agency and municipal agreements, and policy at sites where DoD conducts or conducted open burning of excess conventional ammunition and explosives…” 
Open burning is still the military’s primary method of getting rid of unused munitions and toxic waste from producing bombs and other explosives. The process is dangerous for public health, and there isn’t enough oversight of the private contractors hired to do this work. This is raising a number of critical questions about how this process is carried out and how it impacts public health. 
I am grateful that the Department of Defense Inspector General has agreed to my request to investigate DoD’s oversight of contractors hired to dispose of conventional weapons at open burning sites. Robust oversight of these contractors is essential for protecting the health and well-being of all who work and live near these installations, but it is clear that this oversight did not take place. This investigation is an important first step in holding DoD accountable for contractors’ hazardous waste disposal practices, and I hope that there will be further efforts to investigate all forms of fraud and abuse with respect to how DoD handles toxic waste from unused ordinance and munitions. 
After reading the ProPublica series entitled Bombs in Our Back Yard, I developed an agenda that included legislative initiatives and other strategies to address some of the issues raised in the series. I secured language in the FY19 NDAA House Report, asking DoD to describe the steps it will take to implement a series of recommendations to stop the open-air burning of munitions. 
Visiting Pease Air National Guard Base 
I visited Pease Air National Guard Base to receive a briefing on our New Hampshire Guard and the KC-46 program. The KC-46 is the next generation of air refueling tankers, and Pease will be one of the first air bases to receive them. I also saw the new KC-46 simulator they will use to train the pilots and crew. 
￼ 
Announcing $16 million EPA funding to improve water infrastructure 
Last week, the Congressional Delegation announced that the EPA has awarded a $16 million Clean Water State Revolving Fund Capitalization Grant to the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) to improve water infrastructure and protect clean drinking water supplies. This grant is an increase of nearly $3 million from the previous year and will be used to protect water quality by financing NHDES’s construction of wastewater treatment facilities, Non-Point Source, and estuary projects throughout New Hampshire. 
Every American has a right to clean air and water. No one should have to worry that their water is contaminated or their children are being harmed by contaminated water. I will continue to fight dangerous proposals to weaken clean water regulations or to cut funding for clean water initiatives. Clean drinking water is essential for public health, and this federal grant demonstrates how federal, state, and local governments can work together to improve wastewater treatment, protect our environment, and improve drinking water quality. 
Presenting the Moakley Award to my Director of Constituent Services 
This award is presented annually to recognize outstanding achievements by New England Congressional Delegation staff. Elise has built a reputation across New Hampshire as a staffer who will do everything possible to help First District constituents, and Elise’s work has had a remarkable impact. She is known as a fierce advocate for New Hampshire veterans, for those who need help with Social Security, and for those seeking assistance with the State Department or with immigration issues. She routinely does outstanding work for First District constituents, almost all of it out of the spotlight. For example, Elise was instrumental in delaying the deportation of many in our Indonesian community. She always brings an innovative approach to every case, and has earned the respect and trust of all she has worked with. I am incredibly proud of her.
Closing thoughts 
It was an honor to meet Stephanie Keegan. Her son Daniel was in the military when he developed an opioid use disorder. We need to do more to make sure our servicemembers and veterans have access to the mental health care they need and have earned. Stephanie has been an incredible advocate on this issue and has pressed for more funding for substance use disorder treatment. It was a pleasure and an honor to meet with her in Portsmouth.

Last weekend, New Hampshire lost a dear friend. The last time I spoke to Senator McCain, he walked over to my table at a restaurant in DC to tell me how much he loved New Hampshire, and said it was his second favorite state. I told him New Hampshire loved him back, and we certainly did. I am grateful for his life and his long service to America. His life had many chapters, but each chapter had the same themes--his love for America, his service, his leadership, and his courage. Our country has lost a true hero. He will be greatly missed.   Best Wishes, ￼  Carol Shea-Porter Member of Congress ￼￼

Oyster operations growing on Little Bay 
Union Leader // Kimberley Haas 
The owner of Virgin Oyster Company says he has always wanted to work on the water. For five seasons, marine biologist Brian Gennaco has been figuring out a way to turn a profit harvesting oysters from Little Bay. He has 50 cages and says if he can bring in 250,000 oysters a year, his operation will be able to support two full-time employees. Right now, he and a part-time University of New Hampshire graduate work in his permitted territory.

New Hampshire gets $16 million to protect water resources 
AP // Staff 
New Hampshire will receive a $16 million grant to improve water infrastructure and ensure the supply of clean drinking water. 
The state's Democratic Congressional delegation announced the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was providing the grant to the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Protection. The grant is an increase of $3 million over last year and will be used to help construct among other things wastewater treatment plants and estuary projects throughout the state. The state also received $162,000 for programs aimed at treating contaminated water. 
  
Defense Inspector General to Investigate Military’s Toxic Open Burning 
ProPublica // Abrahm Lustgarten 
The Department of Defense’s internal watchdog is launching an investigation into the military’s heavily polluting practice of open burning and detonating hazardous explosive materials on its properties, as well as its frequent reliance on federal contractors to carry out that work. 
The inquiry, announced Aug. 10 on the website of the department’s Office of Inspector General, will examine whether the department’s practices are legal, and whether the contractors charged with handling dangerous materials — often close to the public — have proper oversight. 
“Robust oversight of these contractors is essential for protecting the health and well-being of all who work and live near these installations,” Democratic Rep. Carol Shea-Porter of New Hampshire wrote to ProPublica in an email. “But it is clear that this oversight did not take place.” 
  
Watchdog probes military burning of ammunition, explosives 
AP // Staff 
The inspector general for the U.S. Department of Defense has launched an investigation into the open burning of ammunition and explosives at military sites across the country, including at a sprawling Army ammunition plant in Virginia. 
The inquiry announced last week was prompted by a congressional request and comes about a year after a lengthy investigation by ProPublica into the military's practice of open burning.

Shea-Porter touts importance of public shipyards 
Fosters // Hadley Barndollar 
KITTERY, Maine — Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter first visited Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in 2007. She returned Wednesday, as she nears the end of her tenure in Washington, to view infrastructure changes and discuss the issue of trades workforce development. 
“This is no time to let up and go light on defense,” Shea-Porter said while standing outside Gate 1 surrounded by union leaders. She pointed to China’s military rise as a crucial reason why the nation’s public shipyards must stay well-oiled and well-staffed. 
Shea-Porter is a member of the House Armed Services Committee, and has been an advocate for resources for the shipyard during her time in Congress. She expressed frustration over a set of President Donald Trump’s executive orders she claims have made it difficult for union leaders to conduct their regular business. It’s part of the administration’s effort to reduce the power of unions. 
  
New Hampshire gets grant to raise awareness about lead paint 
AP // Staff 
CONCORD, N.H.  
New Hampshire has received a federal grant to help raise awareness about the potential health problems associated with lead paint in older buildings. 
Two members of the state's Democratic Congressional delegation announced this week that the state had received a $40,000 grant from the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency. Democratic Reps. Carol Shea-Porter and Annie Kuster say the money will help maintain a certification program for individuals and contractors, audit state-certified lead training providers, and increase lead-based paint education awareness. 
Shea-Porter says that lead paint poses ""significant health risks"" to residents and that it must be dealt with carefully by certified contractors. Kuster, meanwhile, notes that New Hampshire is especially vulnerable to this problem, since much of its housing stock spans decades and, in some cases, centuries.

8/28/18 21:24,VIDEO UPDATE: tariffs,"￼
We've known for a while now that the Administration's trade war wasn't good for Missouri -- but this week I heard firsthand from Missouri businesses and farmers just how bad it really is.




I asked businesses from across our state to join me for a roundtable, and they made one thing absolutely clear: this trade war is hurting Missourians. 
I wanted to make sure you saw this, friend.  WATCH THE VIDEO: ￼ 
We're looking at billions of dollars of potential loss in Missouri because of this trade war. These tariffs could have lasting effects for YEARS to come -- and farmers and manufacturers are sounding the alarm.
From growing soybeans and corn to manufacturing boats and nails, this trade war is hurting Missouri businesses and farmers across the state -- and costing Missourians jobs.
I've heard it straight from those affected: this trade war needs to end.
I won't stop fighting for Missouri.

8/28/18 19:18,Remembering the Service of Sen. John McCain,"The Durbin Report: A message from Senator Richard J. Durbin
￼ 



Fellow Illinoisans, 
Over the weekend, I lost a friend and America lost its hero in Senator John McCain.  He was a true patriot with a noble, fighting spirit.  He was a man of uncommon decency and integrity who gave more for this country than many of us can imagine.  
To have John McCain on your side in the Senate was always an advantage and when he was on the opposite side of an issue, he was always an honorable opponent.  In one of his last speeches on the Senate floor, Sen. McCain challenged Congress to end the partisan battles and start working together to do something good for the American people.  He said we must, “recover our sense that we are more alike than different.”  I couldn’t agree more. 
￼ 
DURBIN SPEAKS ON THE SENATE FLOOR ABOUT THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF SEN. JOHN MCCAIN 
In closing, John McCain represented “service” in every sense of the word. I will miss him, and America will miss him.  
Sincerely, 
U.S. Senator Dick Durbin

Dear Friend:  
Smoke-Choked Skies Across Oregon Show Real Need for Change 
As I’ve traveled throughout our district, meeting with veterans, farmers, ranchers, small business owners, community leaders, and other hardworking Oregon families, I’ve seen something all too familiar regardless of where I go: smoke-choked skies and communities blanketed with haze. 
￼ 
Smoky skies reveal an orange sun in the Gorge on my way to Umatilla. 
￼
Low visibility from smoke in Pendleton as poor air quality persists across eastern Oregon. 
￼ 
As I made my way through Baker, I could barely see the Elkhorn Mountains across the Baker Valley because of the smoke. 
I’ve also received similar pictures from people across our district dealing with another summer filled with smoke. The photos often come with the same message: something needs to change. 
￼ 
Christy, a mother from southern Oregon, sent me this picture of hazy skies and told me, “my children want to play outside but they can’t.” 
It’s time for Congress to act for Oregon families like Christy’s and people across the West who are suffering from unnaturally catastrophic wildfires every summer. I’m continuing to push the Senate to act on the Farm Bill forest management reforms passed in the House, so Oregon families don’t have to be trapped inside all summer because of smoke.
￼ 
Greg Walden: ""Fix broken policies to help restore forests"" 
“We are hostages in our own homes.” That’s how Jennifer, a mother from Medford, described to me what communities in Southern Oregon and across the West are enduring yet again: a summer filled with smoke and fire.
Jennifer continued in her letter to me saying, “my children are robbed of being able to play outside. I absolutely hate that nothing is done to prevent this from happening.”

Walden Brings Region’s Top EPA Official to Southern Oregon to Meet with Citizens Concerned About Smoke 
￼
I welcomed the region’s top official with the Environmental Protection Agency, Chris Hladick (seated center at head of table) to Medford to meet with concerned citizens about the health consequences of wildfire smoke. 
Communities in southern Oregon and across the western United States are experiencing some of the worst air quality in the world because of wildfires. It is important to understand the full scope of the terrible health consequences of this smoke and what can be done to prevent these unnaturally devastating wildfires in the first place. That’s why I invited the region’s top official with the EPA, Chris Hladick, to Medford to meet with concerned citizens, small business owners, community leaders, and forest managers to hear firsthand how the smoke has impacted business and our everyday lives in Oregon. 
The iconic Shakespeare Festival has cancelled 22 shows -- a record far surpassing the previous record of nine cancellations. Local high school sports teams have moved practices and games indoors, with unhealthy air quality making it unsafe to play outside. And white-water rafting on the Rogue River grinded to a halt with massive wildfires making this popular summer recreation destination too dangerous. All of this hurts our local economy and robs people of the enjoyment of our state’s outdoors -- something unique that we cherish as Oregonians. 
￼ 
Rep. Greg Walden discussing smoke with Jackson Co. leaders 
Jackson County’s smoke committee met with Oregon Congressman Greg Walden Friday morning, along with an administrator from the Environmental Protection Agency. All committee members got the opportunity to voice their concerns as to how the smoke is impacting the people they serve.
Click here to learn more from KOBI 5 in Medford. 
This fall, I’ve announced that the Energy and Commerce Committee -- where I serve as Chairman -- will hold a hearing to examine the air quality, environmental, and health impacts of wildfire smoke. Data show that if we do the work upfront to reduce the fuel loads that have built up in our forests due to a lack of management, we can greatly reduce the intensity and carbon emissions of wildfires when they do strike. Who wouldn’t want to take steps to stop wildfires from getting out of control and limit the carbon pollution dumped into our air from these fires?

Walden Receives Update on Efforts to Battle Taylor Creek and Klondike Fires
￼ 
At the Incident Command Center at Lake Selmac on Friday, I received an update on efforts to contain the Taylor Creek and Klondike fires in southern Oregon. We must thank our brave firefighters for working tirelessly to battle wildfires raging across our state, and for putting themselves in harm’s way protecting people and property throughout Oregon. 
When wildfires do strike, I think it is important that we are fighting to extinguish them as aggressively as possible -- keeping in mind the longer they burn the more they dump carbon, fine particulates and carcinogens into our air and destroy more of our forests. 
Recently, I wrote a letter to the Trump Administration raising these concerns and urging the President to expand use of active forest management practices on public lands to reduce risk of catastrophic wildfires. We can increase and improve the nation’s firefighting and fire prevention efforts, which will greatly benefit people in Oregon and across the country. 
￼ 
Walden pays visit to Selma fire camp, says he’ll fight to change forest policy 
U.S. Rep. Greg Walden and local politicians heard the latest from fire managers Friday afternoon at the Klondike Fire camp pitched at Lake Selmac.
The lawmakers are concerned about the smoke, the size of the fires, and the worsening fire seasons in recent years. 
Walden didn't publicly talk about his forest policy bills at fire camp, but afterward, before driving off to a flight from Medford to Bend, he said that he'll continue to fight for policies that thin the forests.

Walden Tours Blue Mountain Seeds’ New Facility in Union County
￼ 
Blue Mountain Seeds is a small business based in Union County that supports jobs for the local community and is continuing to expand. Recently, I was invited to join the team at Blue Mountain Seeds on a tour of their new seed cleaning facility outside of La Grande. 
During our meeting, we discussed the upcoming Farm Bill, which is currently being negotiated between members of the House and Senate. This legislation is an important safety net for agriculture and members of the ag community like the hardworking people at Blue Mountain Seeds. It is also important to improve the management of our forests to reduce the wildfire smoke that has hurt small businesses like Blue Mountain Seeds across our state. 
Farmers who were at the meeting told me that smoke levels drastically impact their ability to maintain normal production cycles and makes it impossible to use prescribed burns on schedule because of the air quality. The Senate needs to advance the House passed forest management reforms in the Farm Bill to change the policies that have negatively impacted farmers, ranchers, businesses, and ordinary people across the West during wildfire season.
￼ 
Walden tours Blue Mountain Seeds, speaks on Farm Bill 
Rep. Greg Walden (R-Hood River) visited Blue Mountain Seeds’ new seed cleaning facility on Wednesday. He met with members of the local agricultural community, including the owners and employees of the Imbler-based company. The next day, leaders from both parties in the House and the Senate had a conference call to begin discussions about the 2018 Farm Bill -- also known as the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 -- the legislation that reforms and continues the programs of the Department of Agriculture.

Walden Speaks at OSU Agriculture Research Center in Hermiston 
￼ 
Oregon State University’s Agricultural Research & Extension Center in Hermiston is at the forefront of equipping farmers with the tools they need to stay competitive, and ensuring students are prepared for in demand jobs in our community. 
I am proud to have worked closely with the OSU team in Hermiston to fix an outdated federal provision that restricted the Extension Center’s ability to grow.  In addition, I supported legislation earlier this year to provide solid funding for the research centers across our district.  These facilities give us the science-based research to provide better habitat for sage grouse; better, common sense policies on food safety and new efforts to combat pests.   
It takes a lot to get this “Duck” to wear an “OSU” hat, but when it comes to Agricultural Research, no one does it better than the OSU crew.  A big thank you to Director Phil Hamm, the entire Extension Center staff, and the ag community in eastern Oregon for your commitment to the success of this center and our students. 
Walden Meets with Wasco County Soil and Water Conservation District 
￼ 
In The Dalles, I met with the Wasco County Soil and Water Conservation District team to receive an update on their work to help farmers recover after the devastating Substation Fire. I’m working closely with them to provide needed relief to local farmers and ranchers after this year’s fires. 
Farmers and ranchers -- especially in Wasco and Sherman counties -- have lost significant crop to rangeland fires that burned across the region. Years of work along 15 Mile Creek literally went up in smoke.   
That’s why I called on Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue to request relief for those impacted. I requested that Secretary Perdue promptly approve the state of Oregon’s disaster declaration, authorize emergency grazing for ranchers who lost substantial forage for their cattle in the fires and grant farmers flexibility to stabilize soil following the fires. I’m glad to see that emergency grazing was authorized to area ranchers, and will continue to work to help the agriculture community in the Gorge get back on their feet after this devastating fire season.

In Warm Springs and Redmond, Walden Thanks Oregon Veterans for Their Service
￼ 
The men and women who have worn our nation’s uniform are owed our profound respect and gratitude. In Warm Springs this weekend, I was honored to recognize 28 veterans of the Korean War for their service. 
The quote engraved in stone at the Korean War Memorial in Washington, D.C. says it best: “Our nation honors her sons and daughters who answered the call to defend a country they never knew and a people they never met.” 
￼
Presenting an American flag that was flown over the Capitol to Laura Jones for her efforts on behalf of Oregon veterans. 
Later on in Redmond, I spent time talking with veterans and their families at the Veterans Appreciation Day BBQ organized by a local veterans’ advocate, Laura Jones, who devotes her days to helping Oregon veterans. Laura put together the BBQ to show her support for local veterans in central Oregon, and the community rallied behind her. With more than $3,000 in donations for raffle prizes and more than 400 pre-made hamburgers donated, Saturday’s BBQ was a tremendous success. As a small token of appreciation for her work, I was proud to present Laura with an American flag flown over the Capitol in her honor. 
I continue to support legislation in Congress to help get our veterans the care and support they deserve. I voted to pass into law historic funding for the VA to ensure they have the resources they need to boost mental health, opioid addiction, and suicide prevention programs. And we’ve secured reforms through the VA MISSION Act, which strengthens the VA and improves care for our veterans. This law includes a provision I authored to bring medical scribes into the VA system, so doctors can focus on the veteran rather than paperwork. 
And over the last year, I’ve helped more than 600 veterans and military service members with issues regarding disability pay, benefits, and health care. If you or a loved one needs help with the VA or any federal agency, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office from Oregon at 800-533-3303. I will do everything I can to get results for you. 
That’s all for this update. Remember, you can always keep in touch with me via email, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 
It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. Congress. 
Best regards, 
Greg Walden U.S. Representative Oregon's Second District

Dear Friend,
If you are a Vietnam War era veteran who served from 1955 through 1975 or if you lost your Vietnam Veteran spouse, I invite you to sign up to be honored at my Vietnam War Veterans Commemoration on:   Tuesday, September 11 at 10:00 AM  MacDill Air Force Base - Davis Conference Center  You can find more information at castor.house.gov or by calling 813-871-2817.  I am proud to serve as a Commemorative Partner to thank and honor the brave men and women in Florida’s 14th Congressional District for their service and sacrifice. Many veterans who served during the Vietnam era were not welcomed home with open arms or given the respect they earned for their service because of the political division over the Vietnam war. No matter one’s beliefs about the war, we should honor those who answered the call of service to their country. At my ceremony at MacDill Air Force Base, each veteran or those who have lost their Vietnam Veteran spouse will receive a commemorative pin and personal thanks – tokens of our country’s appreciation and gratitude for their service and sacrifice.  There is still time to register for this very special ceremony. If you are a Vietnam War era veteran served from 1955 through 1975 or if you have lost your Vietnam Veteran spouse, please find more details at castor.house.gov or call 813-871-2817 – I would love to honor you.

From the Hill to the Mountains
Remembering Senator John McCain
Senator John McCain lived his life with the upmost integrity and he held the rest of us to that same standard. His commitment to our nation is unparalleled and we are all better for the example he set. 
  
Senate Republicans Run from AG Morrisey Lawsuit to Deny Coverage to West Virginians with Pre-Existing Conditions
On Thursday, August 23rd, Senator Thom Tillis and nine of his fellow Republicans filed a bill separating themselves from the ongoing lawsuit threatening to strip away critical protections for people with pre-existing conditions. While the bill would not provide anywhere near the level of protection necessary to protect the nearly 800,000 West Virginians with pre-existing conditions, it acknowledges for the first time the tragic consequences of the lawsuit now pending in the Northern District of Texas (Texas vs. United States), led by 20 Republican Attorneys General, including West Virginia’s Attorney General. 
From the minute West Virginia’s Attorney General entered into Texas vs. United States to deny protections for West Virginians with pre-existing conditions, I have been meeting with clergy, doctors and nurses, hospital administrators, insurance companies and those with pre-existing conditions to fight this lawsuit to once again allow insurance companies to deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions. I even went as far as to introduce a resolution to authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to intervene in this cruel lawsuit on behalf of the U.S. Senate to defend these men, women and children and fight for their right to affordable health insurance access. 
Senate Republicans have finally admitted that this horrendous lawsuit is dangerous for the country and are scrambling to find a fix. Unfortunately, with only a few days before this harmful lawsuit begins, this legislation is just a weak attempt to disguise their efforts to roll back protections for nearly 800,000 West Virginians with pre-existing conditions. If Republican Attorneys General win this lawsuit, we will go back to a time when insurance companies could deny coverage to people with diabetes, arthritis, cancer, heart disease and any other pre-existing condition. This harmful lawsuit should never have been brought in the first place and is dangerous for West Virginians.
  
Securing Funding in Spending Bill to Reimburse Martinsburg for Clean-Up of Water Supply 
In 2016, when Martinsburg and other West Virginia communities were faced with the daunting news that their drinking water sources had been contaminated with unacceptable levels of PFOA in their drinking water supply I started working with federal agencies and Martinsburg officials. I am excited that Martinsburg will finally be reimbursed for the cleanup costs after PFOA was detected in the water supply. Now my top priority will be making sure this funding stays in the final spending bill which is now going to conference with the House of Representatives. Read more here. 
  
Introducing Legislation to Improve Early Detection of Black Lung
Last week I introduced legislation to boost participation in federal programs that detect and treat black lung disease among coal miners. 
Coal miners sacrifice a lot, including their own health, to keep our lights on, heat our homes, and power our businesses. Black lung cases are at a 25-year high and with today’s technology and our knowledge of this disease, that is simply unacceptable. Our amendment will make sure more miners participate in early detection so we can catch it and treat it quicker. The health and safety of our miners should always be our number one priority and I will be fighting for this amendment to be included in the final spending bill. 
 
On the Road
Over the weekend, I attended the dedication of a bronze statue on the campus of West Virginia State University in honor of Katherine Johnson. It is my hope that the students who pass it every day will be reminded of Katherine’s legacy and will be inspired to keep their passion for knowledge alive. It was also her 100th Birthday weekend, and it was an honor to present her with a congressional record statement honoring her legacy with NASA.

This funding through the Community Facilities Program will support the purchase of vehicles and other equipment for emergency and non-emergency purposes. 
I am happy to see these West Virginia communities receive the valuable resources needed to update their public infrastructure and communities. The updated police fleets will keep the communities of Princeton, Bluefield, Romney, Glenville and Smithers safer. The utility vehicles for Romney and Alderson will help facilitate public works and repairs around the community. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue advocating for these resources.   Individual awards listed below: 
	•	$55,500 to the City of Romney.
	•	$50,000 to the Big Otter Volunteer Fire Department.

A grateful nation mourns the Maverick Senator John McCain’s death on Saturday brought most in the country together to honor his service and legacy. His final message, delivered by a longtime friend, encouraged Americans to always “believe in the promise and greatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here.”  + Jim said: “America lost a hero today. Senator McCain’s life and legacy will live on.” 
￼ 
 Early voting continues in Nashville  Davidson County residents can early vote for vice mayor until September 1. You can find the early voting locations here. Election Day is September 6. Voters can request an absentee ballot here. Voters are also heading to the polls in Florida, Arizona and Oklahoma today.  Conversation about voting in Tennessee  Last night, Jim participated on a panel called “Why aren’t Tennesseans voting like they should?” Hosted by the Tennessean and the Lipscomb University Nelson C. Andrews Institute for Civic Leadership, Jim was joined in the forum by Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett, Tennessee State Sen. Steve Dickerson, and Shanna Hughey, president of ThinkTennessee. You can view the 90-minute on Facebook or Twitter. 
+ Jim said: 
	•	“If we were talking about economic development or level of taxation or anything like that, we would pretty much demand that Tennessee be top five in America—maybe even number one. In the economic area we demand so much more. But in the democracy area, it’s OK to drag bottom? I don’t think so.” 
	•	“We need to stop suppressing the vote. That has been an active political strategy since Richard Nixon’s ‘southern strategy.’”  
	•	“Our voting machines are some of the most dated and hackable in America.”

 Federal court rules Congressional maps in North Carolina are unconstitutional, again...  Maps may have to be redrawn by this November.    Judge in Seattle extends ban on 3D-printed gun blueprints For the second time in less than a month, a federal judge has blocked the online publication of 3D-printed gun blueprints. The judge sided with attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia in preventing the blueprints from being released. This comes after the Trump administration settled a lawsuit paving the way for the blueprints to be published online. The blueprints would give anyone the ability to print a gun at home, including criminals. The self-manufactured guns do not have serial numbers and are often made of plastic, making them untraceable and undetectable by metal detectors.  + Jim has cosponsored the Untraceable Firearms Act, which would effectively outlaw 3D-printed guns. + Jim previously  joined a letter to the House Foreign Affairs and Judiciary Committee chairmen requesting a hearing on the State Department's recent settlement with Defense Distributed that allowed the online publication of blueprints to produce 3D printed guns.

Northeast Tennessee leads nation in pre-existing conditions  
According to a new report from the Kaiser Family Foundation, four-in-ten adults in the Tri-Cities area of Northeast Tennessee have a pre-existing condition, the highest rate in the country. The pre-existing conditions – current or past – include diagnoses like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, drug addiction, and pregnancy. These conditions precluded many individuals from purchasing health insurance before the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010.  
￼ 

New NAFTA deal, possibly without Canada On Monday, President Trump announced a new bilateral agreement between the U.S. and Mexico, increasing the possibility that Canada will be excluded from an updated NAFTA. The new agreement has largely the same basis as NAFTA – that American companies can operate and compete in Mexico with zero tariffs – but differs mainly for the auto industry. Any new trade deal must be approved by Congress, which means the U.S. and Mexico – and possibly Canada – would have until the end of this week to agree to terms before the window closes for Congress’ consideration this year. If a trilateral agreement is not reached, it will have major implications for companies that rely on all three countries for seamless trade.

Dear Friend, 
Black Canyon of the Gunnison Celebration
This past week I had the opportunity to speak at the celebration of the addition of a priority property to the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. This addition, funded by the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), will increase access for recreational activities, solve maintenance needs by providing a water source, and serve as protection to the Park's beautiful scenery.  
The benefits of the Black Canyon addition is one of several reasons why it is crucial to permanently reauthorize the LWCF before it expires on September 30th. LWCF is the crown jewel of conservation programs. It has provided more than $268 million to Colorado conservation alone since its creation.

Reimbursing Water Authorities for Contamination Cleanup

I applaud the recent passage of the amendment I sponsored that addresses water contamination near military bases. I have been fighting for the communities impacted by per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and I am glad to see the amendment included in the appropriations bill. This amendment will reimburse municipal water authorities that faced immediate and necessary cleanup costs from their work to ensure their communities had clean drinking water.

Amendment to Restrict Funding to El Salvador
Last week, I introduced an amendment that will restrict United States funding to El Salvador. El Salvador recently announced they would break diplomatic ties with Taiwan which is the wrong decision to make. This amendment will send a direct message to Taiwan's allies that the United States supports Taiwan's international role and will stand up to China's bullying tactics.  
View full text of the amendment here. 
Taking Care of Our Troops
Last week, I spoke on the Senate floor regarding the defense appropriations bill. This legislation would provide critical funding to the brave men and women of Colorado serving in uniform. It provides the first significant pay raise in almost 10 years to our military, a raise that is long overdue. 
The appropriations bill also provides funding that will allow for the expansion of cyber research like cybersecurity research, missile defense and cyber enhancements. Crucial cyber security programs will remain funded as a provision in this bill, allowing for more developments to be made in technology that will expand our capabilities when it comes to cyber attacks. 
I also spoke about the bipartisan effort I am leading called the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act (ARIA) that will set a generational policy. China has made it clear they will continue to bully their neighbors, this act comes as a response to their actions.

No, President Trump, 
The War on Poverty Is Not Over

￼

The Trump administration recently said the War on Poverty is “largely over and a success.” Honestly, I do not know what world they are living in. More than 40 million Americans live below the poverty line. Almost 27 percent of Vermonters qualify for food assistance and 14 percent of Vermont children lack reliable access to enough food. These are our neighbors who, without that assistance, might otherwise go hungry. And now, falsely claiming the war on poverty is over, Trump wants to cut nutrition assistance for struggling families and impose punitive work requirements. Instead, we must redouble our efforts to fight poverty. Let’s not further penalize people – especially kids – for being poor.

Upward Bound: Helping Students Get to College

￼

TRIO programs like Upward Bound do enormously important work preparing young people for college. I know from firsthand experience the challenges students can face when they are the first person in their family to get a post-secondary education. It can be difficult to figure out how to navigate all the forms, choose a school, and figure out how to pay for it. TRIO does an extraordinary job reaching out to young people, keeping them focused and giving them the confidence, skills and support they need to succeed.

Vermont Is Leading the Way on Transforming Our Energy System

￼
 
￼

Earlier this month, I met with two groups of Vermonters working hard to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy. First, I spoke with the employees at SunCommon in Waterbury about the different ways they, and other Vermont solar companies, are helping Vermonters of all income levels “go solar.” Whether you are interested in helping fight climate change or simply want to save money on your energy bill, installing solar often makes a whole lot of sense. In Montpelier, I toured an innovative wood-chip powered district heating system that delivers reliable and affordable heat to several dozen state, municipal and private buildings in downtown Montpelier. I am very proud to have helped secure an $8 million federal grant to get the project off the ground, which not only significantly reduces the use of heating oil, but also keeps energy dollars right here in Vermont by using locally sourced wood.

AmeriCorps Volunteers: Working Hard for Vermont

￼

AmeriCorps is a wonderful national service program that places “members” in community organizations that fight poverty, serve youth and seniors, protect the environment and much more. In exchange for their work, AmeriCorps members gain real world skills and receive up to $6,000 to cover the costs of college education or to help pay back qualified student loans. Here in Vermont, AmeriCorps members have been doing some really great work for years, and with a new $3 million federal award, five Vermont projects will be able to continue those efforts.

Mourning Sen. John McCain 
￼ 
“One of our country’s greatest citizens, John McCain devoted his life to the Nation, first as a Naval Aviator and then as a member of the House of Representatives and for more than three decades a United States Senator.  His heroism as a prisoner of war, his tenacity in the halls of Congress and his courageous campaigns for President are all testaments to his magnificent service to the United States.   I was privileged to run on the same ticket with Senator McCain in 2008 and believe he would have been an excellent President. At his passing we are reminded of the Naval Hymn’s humble prayer that all who serve in peril on the sea or in the air might be brought safely home again by our Eternal Father.” — Rep. Leonard Lance

Lance involved with bi-partisan plan to break the gridlock in Congress 
￼ 
It is not as sexy as immigration reform nor is it as controversial as Russian influence in U.S. elections.  But as wonky as it is, a proposal by a Congressional group calling itself the “Problem Solvers Caucus” could have profound, longstanding impacts on opening the system to greater bipartisan participation.  The caucus includes 48 members, equally divided among Democrats and Republicans. New Jersey members of congress on the caucus include Rep. Leonard Lance, R-7, and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-5, the co-chair of the caucus along with Rep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y.  A statement from the caucus said that “due to the House floor being controlled by a select few” most members of Congress cannot bring their ideas and proposals to the House floor for a fair vote.  “I believe deeply in bipartisan cooperation and that the best, most effective government is from the center-out,” Lance said in a statement. “These reforms will strengthen that process.”

Warren Committeewoman Carolann Garafola and Congressman Leonard Lance Tackle Warren Postal Issues 
￼ 
Warren Committeewoman Carolann Garafola joined Congressman Leonard Lance last Tuesday in a meeting with officials from the U.S. Postal Service regarding ongoing resident complaints about mail services in the Township.    Mail delivery in Warren has had problems and issues for years.  Residents and businesses of Warren Township have experienced an increase in problems and issues regarding the U.S. Post Office with many residents complaining that their mail is not being delivered when it should be, if at all.   “Area residents continue to be frustrated with Warren mail and postal services,” Lance tweeted after the meeting.  “Today Committeewoman Carolann Garafola and I met with postal officials and demanded a timeline for improvements and a list of action items the USPS must undertake to improve services.”  The Postal Service officials in attendance, including Eric Henry, the Acting District Manager of the Northern NJ USPS District, promised to deliver to Lance and Township officials an action plan to improve services and to host a town hall meeting with residents to discuss the complaints and improvements.  Lance is the federal lawmaker for Warren and the USPS is a federal entity.  Area residents experiencing difficulty with the Postal Service should contact Bobbi Goodman in Lance’s Westfield District Office at 908-518-7733.    
Lance Announces More Than $400k In Federal Grants For Fire Departments
 ￼
￼ 
Congressman Leonard Lance announced that 7th District fire departments are receiving more than $400,000 in federal grants through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).   
Two awards totaling $228,693 in Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) have been issued to Dover and will be used for gear acquisition and the procurement of an ambulance.  The $74,000 awarded to Roxbury will be used to purchase and install a vehicle exhaust extraction system at the Co. 1 Firehouse in Succasunna.   
Lance visited the Dover and Roxbury Fire Companies last week to relay the news personally. 
“These grants come at just the right time.  Calls are up and demand on the Fire Department is on the rise.  Let’s put these funds to work and get the best gear, a new ambulance and repurpose aging equipment to be reliable in an emergency.  Morris County residents are counting on this great crew every day of the week.  I commend all firefighters and EMS on their public service and I hope for their safety in dangerous situations,” said Lance.

I wanted to reach out about some recent developments in trade policy over the last 48 hours or so. As you likely know, it’s been a tough few years for South Dakota agriculture, and while many producers are looking at bumper crops this year, the recent trade disputes have really hit prices hard. 
I’ve spoken extensively with President Trump on this issue and have emphasized that producers cannot afford to bear the brunt of trade disputes. In response, USDA announced a $12 billion aid package to help give producers a safety net. The details of that program were released yesterday. Here are the basics:
	•	Market Facilitation Program: Starting September 4, USDA’s Farm Service Agency will use this program to make payments to corn, cotton, dairy, hog, sorghum, soybean, and wheat producers. A second round of payments may be made if necessary. Producers can apply after harvest is complete. CLICK HERE for more information on included commodities, eligibility requirements, and application tips.
	•	Food Distribution Program: The Ag Marketing Service will purchase American commodities to be distributed through nutrition assistance programs like the Emergency Food Assistance Program. CLICK HERE to learn more about selling food to USDA. 
	•	Trade Promotion Program: This program aims to develop new international market opportunities. Applications are available until November 2 or until funds run out. CLICK HERE to learn more about the Trade Promotion Program.
But if you talk to a producer, they’ll tell you they want trade, not aid. And we had another development on that front Monday. More specifically, President Trump announced a preliminary agreement with Mexico to renegotiate NAFTA. According to the White House, the pact includes:
	•	Continuation of zero tariffs on agricultural products;
	•	New standards for agricultural biotechnology;
	•	Improved transparency and non-discriminatory treatments for agricultural product standards;
	•	Enhanced rules for science-based sanitary and phytosanitary measures; and
	•	New disciplines on geographical indications and common names for cheeses, among other things.
To get further details, click here.  
I’m hopeful this announcement is a first step in driving Canada to the table and once again offering South Dakota producers greater certainty in trade.   
The bottom line is this: South Dakota producers grow the world’s best corn, soybeans, livestock, and small grains, and they deserve to be able to trade those goods in a fair, open, and competitive marketplace. 
If you have questions about these programs or need help, please contact my office at 855-225-2801. We’re here to help.

Op-Ed: Congressman Cook: Trump’s sanctions against Russia and Iran necessary for global stability 
Over the past two weeks, the Trump Administration has taken necessary and aggressive action to punish and deter two of the most destabilizing forces in the world today: the Russian mafia-state led by Vladimir Putin and the radical Islamic theocracy in Iran led by Ayatollah Khameini. While these new sanctions have been levied for different offenses, together they send the message that rogue actors will pay a price for their deadly and destabilizing activities. 

Since 2008, Putin’s efforts to upset global stability have increased ten-fold. At his direction, Russia has invaded sovereign territory in Georgia and initiated a war against Ukraine, forcefully acquiring the Crimean peninsula. He supports the murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, indiscriminately targeting civilian populations, resulting in tens of thousands of civilian casualties. Putin has supported, through illicit means and illegal money laundering, racist, nationalist political parties across Europe. He has used information warfare to increase distrust in political processes and elections – including our own. He has even ordered the murder of civilians on foreign soil. 

On March 4, 2018 a former Russian military officer and dual Russian and British citizen, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter Yulia, were poisoned using Novichok nerve agent. Novichok is a chemical weapon created solely by the Soviet Union and subsequently banned by international law. Had the Russian agents been successful, these potential murders would have been the 16th and 17th murders on British soil ordered by Vladimir Putin. According to the Chemical and Biological Weapons and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, we can take specific action against the perpetrators of any chemical weapons attack. Now that we are sure the Russians carried out this attack, we can prohibit the export of a long list of electronic components and other technologies that could be used for military purposes. If after 90 days, the Russians fail to allow UN inspectors into their facilities, they can expect measures that are even more punishing. These new measures, combined with the existing sanctions implemented over the past year, send a strong signal to Putin that his actions will result in severe consequences. 

The Khameini regime’s destabilizing activities in the Middle East are possibly even more destructive. In Lebanon, they support Hezbollah, a political party turned radical Islamic militia who has corrupted the Lebanese government and has expanded their illicit activities around the world. During the height of the Iraq War, Iran-backed Shia militias killed and wounded thousands of American and Iraqi soldiers and civilians. They continue to provide safe haven for a variety of terrorist organizations and their leadership. They currently support a Houthi militia in Yemen whose civil war has led to incredible humanitarian suffering. Despite very generous terms in the nuclear deal, they have continued to improve their ballistic missile technology and increased their support for radical militias around the region. In coordination with the Russians, they continue to support the Assad regime in Syria, prolonging a civil war that has led to over 400,000 killed and nearly 11 million refugees both inside and outside the country. 

Our issue is not with the people of either country, but rather with the men who are acting as their leaders, promoting war and genocide, ordering the murder of civilians on foreign soil, disrupting and destroying electoral processes and democratic institutions across the West, and insist that these atrocities are somehow in their national interests. They are wrong. Until these despotic regimes understand this fact and begin to change their behavior, they can continue to expect the full economic and diplomatic might of the United States and its allies to be leveraged against them. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle in Congress are united in the belief that we must take a strong stand against these rogue actors. We will continue to challenge Russia and Iran with all tools necessary until they abandon their efforts to destroy global stability.

The Loss of a Maverick
Dear Friends,

Dee Dee and I are deeply saddened by the news of Senator John McCain’s passing. We mourn the loss of an American who fought valiantly for his life, his country, and his constituents. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends during this incredibly difficult time. May his service and sacrifice inspire Americans for generations to come.

The best part of the August work schedule is that it gives me some much-appreciated time to meet with residents of the 10th District in person and see how our community is growing and changing firsthand. I always look forward to this busy month for the chance to talk to the people I represent in Washington about their concerns and policies affecting our Nation.

On Monday, I joined Rotarians in Lawrenceville to provide an update on my work with President Trump to advance our shared agenda. Between a booming economy and rebuilding our military, optimism about the future continues to build. Thanks for having me!

After the event, I made my way over to Butts County to tour the newest Dollar General Distribution Center in Jackson. This one million square foot facility, which officially opened earlier this year, has already created more than 600 jobs in the community through its $85 million-dollar investment. As America’s leading small box discount retailer, Dollar General currently operates more than 700 stores and employs more than 7,000 people in the state of Georgia. I’m excited that our area continues to be a hub for business as we work toward long-term growth.

Then, I had the pleasure of visiting the American Woodmark Corporation’s manufacturing plant down the road. This location has manufactured more than 22 million kitchen and bath cabinets and works with independent dealers and distributors, such as Lowe’s and The Home Depot. At Woodmark, I saw the process of assembling cabinets and learned about its direct economic impact on the local community. Thanks for the warm welcome!

As part of National Startup Week, on Thursday, I attended meetings with two small businesses in Athens. The first firm, Docebo NA Inc. Software Company, created a platform for e-learning and established its presence in Athens in 2012. Docebo – which means ""I will teach"" in Latin – offers a learning portal for companies and their employees, partners, and customers to deliver, track, and certify online training. 

The second business, Roundsphere, is a consulting agency that provides the resources necessary for startups, entrepreneurs, and small businesses to thrive. Founded in 2010, it has grown to employ over 50 people working at its headquarters in Athens with dozens more working remotely across the world. Keep up the great work!

Next, I joined senior citizens at Athens First United Methodist for a lunch and learn, where I provided an update on issues important to the older population, such as Social Security, Medicare, and national security. It was a pleasure being with all of you! Thanks for your feedback.

Through my assignment on the House Armed Services Committee, on Friday, I met with Georgia National Guardsmen in Marietta, reviewed their recent trainings and missions, and received updates on upcoming deployments. While there, we also discussed the assistance the Guard provided during the state of emergency due to Hurricane Irma last year, had a chance to learn about the Youth Challenge Program and National Guard Counterdrug Program, and got a firsthand look at its aviation troop command.

Last year, GTRI did nearly a half billion dollars in research and development primarily for branches of the U.S. military and the Department of Defense.

Dear Friend 
Last night, my office wrapped up the last session of our Young Women Leadership Program (YWLP) series! Beginning in 2016, YWLP serves as an opportunity for young women from 9th to 12th grade throughout the Sixth District to meet and interact with professional women in the great state of Minnesota who have built successful careers. 
As the father of seven children, I had the duty of raising 6 boys and the privilege of raising one daughter, Katie. Being the middle child between all of her brothers gets crowded, so I always made sure Katie knew she was capable of absolutely anything. Now, as a representative in Congress, I have the opportunity to amplify this message which is how the Young Women’s Leadership Program started. I am honored to help connect young women to influential and successful mentors, so that they know they are capable of absolutely anything, just like I told Katie.  
    ￼ 
Participants receiving a tour from event host, Jeanine Davis, owner of Minnesota Street Works. 
YWLP participants are encouraged to take ownership of this experience, they lead the discussion with our gracious panelists who dedicate their time to share their insights. This year's participants were incredible, asking questions that I hadn’t even considered when I was their age. From inquiring about the challenges these women have had to overcome to succeed, to the proper networking etiquette, I was blown away by their curiosity and maturity. 
  ￼ 
Congressman Emmer with panelists. 
Last night’s panelists were Lt. Lori Ellering, of the St. Cloud Police Department; Ashley Kohls, Executive Director of the Minnesota Cattlemen's Association; and Julie Kimble, Founder and President of KimbleCo. Huge thanks to these successful Minnesotans for taking the time to share their insights with our participants! Without the partnership of our incredible panelists, YWLP would not be possible.

Hoosiers,  Last week was Startup Week Across America, a time to highlight that startup businesses, which are at the forefront of innovation and job creation, are a driving force in our nation's economy. As they grow, more jobs are created, and more economic excitement is developed in our neighborhoods.  Access to capital is the key component for our local startups and small businesses to grow, hire more Hoosiers, and contribute to our communities. However, there continues to be a capital investment disparity between the coasts and our home in Indiana. For example, in the first three months of 2018, more than half of all venture capital dollars invested in small businesses and startups went to the state of California.   To address this, and allow any idea to turn into reality, I've introduced four bills to foster an economic environment that allows any and all Americans to take an idea, create a new business, and change the lives of consumers. Take a look:
	•	Developing and Empowering our Aspiring Leaders Act (H.R. 6177) - By encouraging more investment from venture capital firms, this legislation will allow more startups and small businesses to access the capital they need to grow their ideas.   
	•	Fostering Innovation Act (H.R. 1645) - Currently, federal regulations are preventing certain biotechnology companies from investing in cutting-edge medical research and development. This bill ensures that government does not stand in the way of innovative medical cures.   
	•	Improving Access to Capital Act (H.R. 2864) - Small businesses continue to face significant challenges in raising capital in order to expand and hire workers. This legislation provides an additional avenue for small reporting companies to raise capital in an efficient, public, and transparent manner.   
	•	Expanding Investment Opportunities Act (H.R. 4279) - By removing burdensome regulations that raise costs for investors, this legislation allows for more investment opportunities for small businesses, companies, and Hoosiers saving for retirement.
This is what the American Dream is all about: turning passion and ideas into reality. I'm committed to fighting for policies that create a better economy and better opportunities for all Americans.  Be of good cheer, 
￼

Dear Friends, 
America lost a true hero this weekend. After fighting his entire life for the ideals for which America was founded, Senator John McCain passed away after a long-fought battle with brain cancer. It was a battle he fought bravely and fiercely like the ones he fought in Vietnam and later in Congress on the Senate floor. He was the true example of an American hero, he was the embodiment of patriotism. I had the tremendous privilege of serving with him at the Munich Security Conference and will always treasure those memories. Linda and I are sending our thoughts and prayers to Senator McCain’s family, friends, and loved ones. May he rest in peace.
￼  
Below are some highlights from TX-10: 
Harvey Roundtable 
I met with constituents and local officials in Katy to discuss where we are with our rebuilding efforts one year after Hurricane Harvey hit. In the past year we have made tremendous strides in our recovery. My top priority from the beginning has been to find the best infrastructure solution on Cypress Creek to mitigate future flooding. I am proud to say the Army Corps of Engineers approved the study for a solution and my bill to expedite this process passed the House.  I continue to stand by willing to help however my office can as we continue to move forward, further recover, and push for infrastructure solutions to mitigate future flooding.  
￼ 
Following this roundtable discussion, I held a press conference with Katy Mayor Chuck Brawner, Katy City Administrator Byron Hebert, Katy Police Chief Bill Hastings, Katy Fire Chief Rusty Wilson, and Katy Emergency Management Coordinator Greg Goedecker.

Army Futures Command Activation Ceremony 
I was honored to attend the Army Futures Command Activation ceremony in Austin. I cannot think of a better home for the center than the booming tech-hub of Austin, which already has close ties to the U.S. Armed Forces. While it will provide more jobs to TX-10, our innovative environment will also ensure our nation's military remains the best of the best. I'm proud to have been apart of the efforts to bring this important center for tech innovation in our military to Texas and our district.
￼ 
McCaul speaks with Army Secretary David Esper ahead of the ceremony on Friday. 
AJC Houston 
I met with members of AJC Houston; a great organization that does global advocacy work to enhance the well-being of the Jewish people and Israel. We had a great conversation about our foreign policy and the importance of defending human rights. Specifically, we discussed Assad’s humanitarian crisis in Syria and H.R. 380, the IRGC Terrorist Designation Act, legislation I introduced to hold those who conduct or facilitate business with the IRGC accountable. 
￼ 
Houston's Cybersecurity Four Year Plan 
I met with officials with the City of Houston to learn about their four-year plan to secure the city from cyber threats. I offered my assistance to the city to help streamline the project as it prepares to host major upcoming events city-wide. As Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I have long focused on making sure we improve our cybersecurity capabilities on state and local levels across the county.
￼  
Snappy's Restaurant in Katy 
Snappy's is a local staple that was hit hard by Hurricane Harvey. I met there to talk with the restaurant's co-owner Alex Tsounakas, Katy Mayor Chuck Brawner, and others about the latest updates on recovery efforts and how I can continue to help. I also had the opportunity to meet with other Texans who were there enjoying lunch. 
￼ 
 ￼ 
  
President's Announcement on Updated Trade Deal with Mexico 
I am encouraged by President Trump’s announcement of an updated trade agreement with Mexico today. There is no doubt that we need improved trade agreements for the 21st century to promote the best interests of America’s small businesses, farmers, and workers. I look forward to reviewing the agreement in full to ensure that it promotes robust trade between Texas and Mexico. I hope today’s announcement also highlights the importance of swiftly working with our close ally Canada to find similar common ground. 
Legislative Update
Last week, Members were in their districts for a District Work Period. There were no votes held in the House last week. 
This week, Members will continue to be in their districts for a District Work Period. As such, there are no votes expected in the House.
As always, I encourage you to visit my website, mccaul.house.gov, for more information on constituent services and legislative updates. Also, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube to get the latest updates on my work in Washington and the 10th District of Texas.

8/27/18 22:48,Rounds Report: Details of USDA's 'Trade Aid' Package Available," 
 
￼
 
     
 

Details of USDA’s ‘Trade Aid’ Package Available   August 27, 2018
Today, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) released the details of its ‘trade aid’ package to help farmers and ranchers adversely affected by ongoing trade disputes. These programs are designed to help our ag producers recoup losses from disrupted markets.
The three programs to assist ag producers are: 
	•	Market Facilitation Program (MFP) - USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) will administer the MFP to provide payments to corn, cotton, dairy, hog, sorghum, soybean and wheat producers starting September 4, 2018. This is the first payment period.  A second payment period, if warranted, will be determined by USDA.
More information is available at www.farmers.gov/MFP.
	•	Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) – The AMS will administer a Food Purchase and Distribution Program to purchase up to $1.2 billion in commodities unfairly targeted by unjustified retaliation. USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service will distribute these commodities through nutrition assistance programs such as The Emergency Food Assistance Program and child nutrition programs.
	•	Trade Promotion Program - Through the Foreign Agricultural Service’s (FAS) Agricultural Trade Promotion Program (ATP), $200 million will be made available to develop foreign markets for U.S. agricultural products. The program will help U.S. agricultural exporters identify and access new markets and help mitigate the adverse effects of other countries’ restrictions.
While we’re glad to see the administration take steps to mitigate the negative impact that market instability is having on our ag producers, this proposal is a short-term Band-Aid. The sooner we can get trade deals completed and the markets under control, the better off our farmers and ranchers will be. Today’s announcement that a short-term trade agreement has been reached with Mexico is a positive first step.

￼
Friends, 
Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it intends to replace the Obama Administration’s proposed Clean Power Plan rule with the Trump Administration’s Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule.
￼ 
This is great news that represents an important step towards returning power to the states and further dismantling the Obama-era regulatory regime. For eight long years, Alabamians suffered under an overly-empowered EPA that burdened hardworking men and women with countless overreaching regulations. I believe that American innovation and our unique entrepreneurial spirit are the keys to meeting the energy challenges of the 21st Century. President Trump’s proposed ACE plan embraces this outlook and will give Alabama companies certainty to create jobs and prosper as we move forward. 
You can read more in my weekly column here. 
RECAP FROM THE ROAD 
It has been a very busy month traveling throughout AL-02, and I wanted to fill you in on a few of the many productive meetings I had on the road last week.  
￼ 
I visited Dothan Behavioral Medicine Clinic where I talked with staff and received a briefing on the Clinicom technology that is used to diagnose mental illness. I really enjoyed this informative meeting and discussing ways we can better address the mental health crisis in our country. 
￼ 
It was great to visit with the West End Boys and Girls Club in Montgomery! I enjoyed touring the facility and had the chance to stop by the Smart Girls Group and other classes while I was there.
￼ 
Earlier in the week, I sat down with Jay Moseley, Teresa Collier, and John Hamm of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency’s Fusion Center. They updated me on the human trafficking problem in our state and their efforts to eradicate this horrendous plague on our communities. I deeply appreciate these leaders and their work to combat this atrocious problem.

Greg's Treasure State Update
Economy booming and wages growing, according to government report 

Our economy is expected to grow 3.1 percent for 2018, according to updated projections by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The U.S. economy hasn’t grown at or above 3 percent in 13 years. 

The report also indicates good news for wages, as “increased demand for labor and competition for workers boost the growth of hourly labor compensation.” 

After more than a decade of sluggish growth – an average of less than 1.5 percent between 2008 and 2017 – Montanans and Americans are seeing the benefits of lower taxes and fewer burdensome regulations. I will continue working on pro-growth policies that increase wages and build greater opportunities for all Montanans.

Congressional committee briefing in Hamilton examines wildfires and forest management 

As chairman of the Interior, Energy, and Environment Subcommittee (IEE), I took the gavel to Hamilton to examine ways to reduce the severity of wildfires. 

We heard from local and national forest professionals on the need for more active forest management. We also discussed the need for reforms that encourage cooperation on forest projects among all levels of government. We must stop the stream of constant litigation that ties up and shuts down commonsense forest management projects. 

As wildfires continue to ravage our resources and fill our skies with unhealthy smoke, it’s clear that reform measures are needed to improve the health of our forests. 

We’ve been making progress, including reform measures I secured in the Farm Bill. 

Active forest management benefits our forests, our wildlife, our environment, and our economy. Everyone wins with more active forest management, except perhaps for lawyers and extreme special interest groups. 

I’ll continue using my position as chairman of the subcommittee to put Montana first. 

Watch the field briefing here.

Rebuilding our military to make our country more secure 

The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (NDAA), which I supported and the President signed into law, provides much needed resources to our service members and their families. It fully funds a 2.6 percent pay raise for our troops, the largest in nine years. 

In Montana, the NDAA authorizes $9 million for construction of an aircraft apron at Great Falls International Airport and $15 million for National Guard Facilities in Malta. 

The law authorizes a $69.4 million increase for the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent Program, which is scheduled to replace the Minuteman III missiles at Malmstrom Air Force Base, as well as $288 million to replace the Vietnam-era UH-1N Huey helicopters currently used for missile security operations at the base. 

The NDAA corrects the boundary of the Limestone Hills Training Area in support of the Montana National Guard.

President Trump signs bipartisan, pro-opportunity measure into law 

Opportunities for Montanans grow as teleworking grows. With increased teleworking, Montanans can have greater access to good-paying jobs in our state. To promote teleworking, I introduced a bipartisan bill that makes it easier for the federal government to recruit and employ well-qualified Montanans. 

President Trump recently signed my measure into law. 

In addition to increasing opportunities for Montanans, teleworking will also help save taxpayer dollars. For example, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) embraced a telework pilot program and, as a result, saved taxpayers $77.4 million in fiscal year 2016. 


Fire training center helps make our communities safer 

Large structure fires are not a welcome sight, but at the Rocky Mountain Emergency Services Training Center in Helena, they can be useful. 

I recently toured that facility and discussed ways Congress is helping to make our communities safer.

Last Week in Congress
U.S. Jobless Claims Near Record Low
￼ ￼ Click here to read more from the Wall Street Journal
Another sign of a healthy and growing economy - last week U.S. jobless claims fell for the third consecutive week, continuing to hover near historic lows. This number represents the number of workers that are being laid off, and the decreasing level shows that our labor market is tight as the vast majority of Americans have jobs right now. Across the country, 65% of Americans say now is a good time to find a quality job, and these layoff numbers back up that sentiment. As our economy grows at the fastest rate in years, we can expect these positive trends to continue. Pro-growth policies like tax reform and regulatory reform are driving this surge, and I look forward to finding more ways to build on this streak of success as America's economy soars.

Third District Job Fair
Yoder Announces Tenth Annual Job Fair
￼ Click here to watch Kevin's video announcement
Today, unemployment is the lowest it's been since 1969, and for the first time since 2000, there are more jobs available than there are unemployed Americans. But there is still more work to be done to help unemployment numbers and to help employers find the workers they need. If you are unemployed in the Third District or just looking for a new, quality job, I will be hosting my tenth annual Job Fair next month. Dress for success, bring copies of your resume, and head over to the Johnson County Community College on Monday, September 24th between 2 and 6 PM. Click here for more info.

Growing Futures Early Education Center
￼ Kevin reading to the Growing Futures class.
Last week, I welcomed Head Start students from Growing Futures Early Education Center in Overland Park. We read Chicka Chicka Boom Boom outside on a beautiful day. Growing Futures has been serving our community for more than 50 years, and programs like theirs help all families access early childhood education and other resources that will set up these kids for long term success. I was proud to vote to increase Head Start funding this year, and we have increased Head Start's total funding by over $1.5 billion since I first came to Congress. Head Start is a smart investment that will lead to a stronger economy, healthier communities, and more opportunities for all young people.
￼
Startup Week Across America
￼ Kevin at the Startup Week roundtable
Last week was Startup Week Across America, raising awareness about the importance of startup businesses. I highlighted Startup Week by hearing from local entrepreneurs here in the Silicon Prairie at the Plexpod in Lenexa. Startups are the driving force behind new jobs in this country, and we are continuing to build on the strong startup reputation that Kansas City as developed. Our community is a great place to live, with high quality of life, and that environment is attracting entrepreneurs to build their startups in the Third District.
I listened to the group discuss their successes, their challenges, and how policymakers like me can best support innovation in our economy. This group of startup leaders told me about the importance that tax reform and immigration reform have for spurring startups. Lower taxes reduce the cost barrier for new businesses to get off the ground, and immigration reform like my Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act will help highly qualified individuals from around the world contribute to innovation in America. We also discussed education and the current shortage of workers who have the skills and training needed for the 21st century economy. We need to increase investment in STEM education at younger ages and give students more opportunities to pursue career and technical education. 
￼
Wolf Springs Elementary School
￼ Kevin visiting the 1st grade class at Wolf Springs Elementary
School has started and I had the opportunity to spend time in a 1st grade classroom at Wolf Springs Elementary School in Overland Park. This was no ordinary classroom - students in this classroom are part of the Chinese Immersion Program in the Blue Valley School District. Since Kindergarten, these students have been engaged in this curriculum where they are becoming fluent and literate in Mandarin Chinese. Principal Dr. Gretchen Anderson and Superintendent Dr. Todd White shared with me that the data shows that students excel in Math and English when immersed in a bi-lingual education. I had the privilege of seeing a classroom of students very attentive, involved, and excitedly learning. Thank you to the teachers and staff I visited with for taking time to share the Chinese Immersion Program with me.
￼
CenturyLink
￼ Kevin speaking to CenturyLink employees
It was a pleasure to stop by CenturyLink in Gardner to visit with their team about federal telecommunications policy. We talked about internet regulations, online privacy, tax reform, and rural broadband infrastructure. Internet issues have been one of my top priorities in Congress, and I have introduced the Email Privacy Act to increase 4th Amendment protections for Americans' emails. I appreciated the feedback from the folks at CenturyLink on all these important matters. 
￼
HCI Energy
￼ Kevin with Bill Cole, Joe Heller, and Leo Morton
Thank you to HCI Energy for inviting me to visit and see the high-tech, innovative work they are doing on hybrid energy systems. HCI is a startup in Lenexa, another great example of how entrepreneurs and startups are powering our economy. They gave me a great briefing on their products and their potential uses in energy, disaster relief, and national security.

Kansas Common Sense  August 27, 2018
Hello,
 
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.
 
Honoring Senator John McCain
John McCain was a true American hero, whose sense of duty to our nation led to a lifetime of dedicated public service. First as a naval aviator serving in Vietnam, his honor led him to refuse early release ahead of his fellow American POWs. Then as a member of Congress and presidential candidate, John remained steadfast in his principles, always seeking to do what he thought was in our nation’s best interest. There has been no better advocate for our servicemembers and veterans than John and it was an honor to work closely with him on achieving the most significant VA reform Congress has passed in decades with the VA MISSION Act. This could not have been possible without his leadership and knowledge, and it was fitting that the bill was named after him.
John was a friend and an example to me and many others. He leaves behind a legacy of courage and conviction – I hope we all can reflect on these values as we work together to heal and advance America. Robba and I are praying for John’s wife, Cindy, their children and grandchildren, as well as John’s mother, and we thank them for sharing John with us for so many years.
Moving Forward with the Appropriations Process This week, the Senate passed the funding bill for ‎the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor, and Education. This package marks the first time in more than a decade that individual Appropriations bills have been considered on the Senate floor with such bipartisan success. Included in the bill is the largest boost in troop pay in more than a decade, as well as further significant investment in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's which affects millions of our fellow Americans. During my time as the lead republican on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, I was proud to have begun the important work of ensuring that our country's medical minds have the resources necessary to combat the diseases that plague our society. The fight is not yet won, but I am encouraged that the Senate continues to build upon the progress we've made against Alzheimer's and other afflictions. 
Included in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill is important funding that will drive medical research and innovation by an investment of an additional $2 billion in the National Institutes of Health, combat opioid abuse through an additional $145 million directed at improving treatment and prevention efforts, and increase funding for community health centers and rural health initiatives to make certain our Kansas communities continue to have access to the care they need. This bipartisan effort will help us address the opioid epidemic, invest in our schools, and hopefully allow our medical researchers to find new treatments and cures that will lower medical costs to our system as a whole and improve patient outcomes. I will work with our federal agencies to ensure this funding is spent responsibly to achieve these goals. 
The House of Representatives and the Senate will now begin the work of resolving the differences between the bodies' two bills. I look forward to continuing my advocacy amongst my colleagues to make certain the appropriations process is reflective of our Kansas priorities. 
Questioning Administration Officials on Russia Sanctions The Senate Banking Committee I serve on has jurisdiction over foreign sanctions, and on Tuesday our committee held a hearing examining the effectiveness of current Russian sanctions and the path forward. I had expected the witnesses representing the administration to provide recommendations for Congress to consider as new measures are debated, and I was disappointed when none of the panelists were forthcoming, despite my questioning. I also asked the Department of Homeland Security to detail how it shares election threats with our state and local officials. There is no sign that Russia has changed its behavior since President Trump met with Vladimir Putin last month, and I was pleased by the bipartisan commitment of the committee to maintain pressure on Russia and protect the integrity of our elections. Watch my full line of questioning here. 
￼ 
Announcing Plans for New Elementary School at Fort Riley I am pleased to announce the recently passed FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes a provision that prioritizes plans for a new elementary school on Fort Riley. The NDAA includes language to stabilize the Department of Defense (DoD) 2011 Public Schools on Military Installations Priority List. This language allows DoD to continue replacing schools while completing an audit previously required by law. 
The NDAA authorization secures priority for USD 475 to plan for and apply for grants to construct a new elementary school at Fort Riley. It has always been my priority to make certain we are not only supporting our servicemembers, but that we are also supporting their children and families. A new elementary school at Fort Riley will prevent overcrowding and provide our service members’ children access to modern and high-quality educational resources and facilities they deserve. 
Since the return of the 1st Infantry Division to Fort Riley in 2005, I have worked closely with the DoD and the US Army to invest in resources to grow and support critical community infrastructure around military installations. Previous projects include a new middle and elementary school on Fort Riley and the state-of-the-art Irwin Army Hospital.  
I also led an amendment to the FY2019 Defense Appropriations bill that passed the Senate on Thursday to provide up to $20 million for a 10-year pilot program authorized in the FY19 NDAA, the Defense Community Infrastructure Program (DCIP). The DCIP will provide DoD grants to assist state and local governments for the funding of infrastructure projects located off base in the military communities surrounding military installations. These grants may be used to support various infrastructure projects such as transportation, schools, hospitals, clinics, police stations, fire stations, emergency response structure and other community support facilities in locations surrounding Fort Riley, Fort Leavenworth, McConnell Air Fort Base, and other National Guard and Reserve component installations. Click here for more information. 
Meeting with Kansas Native and Office of Science and Technology Policy Nominee On Wednesday, I met with Dr. Kelvin Droegemeier, the nominee to be director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy within the executive branch. Dr. Droegemeier – an Ellsworth native – is the current Oklahoma Secretary of Science and Technology and is a professor at the University of Oklahoma. He is a well-regarded scientist and meteorologist with a host of academic and professional accomplishments that will serve the office and our country well. 
As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, I have the unique responsibility of overseeing funding for many federal agencies that carry out scientific research and utilize scientific discovery in their everyday work. Additionally, I remain focused on increasing opportunities for young Kansans in STEM fields; once confirmed, I know Dr. Droegemeier will be a strong advocate for STEM education within the administration. 
￼  
Speaking on the Importance of NIH for Alzheimer’s Research This week, I gave remarks on the Senate floor in support of funding increases for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that were passed in the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill, specifically NIH funding that supports Alzheimer’s disease research. Within the overall NIH funding increase is a $425 million increase for Alzheimer’s disease-specific research, for a total $2.3 billion in funds designated to support Alzheimer’s disease research in FY2019. 
These increased resources allow NIH researchers and their partners at academic institutions, like our very own University of Kansas Alzheimer’s Disease Center, to aggressively pursue new treatments to delay the onset of Alzheimer’s, and ultimately find a cure to this degenerative disease that has afflicted millions of Americans and their families. I will continue to advocate for stable NIH funding and support Alzheimer’s research to ultimately put an end to the suffering this disease has caused so many. Watch my full remarks here. 
￼ 
Hosting Townhall Meetings This week, I hosted three Kansas Listening Tour stops which marked my 86th townhall of this Congress and my 1,293rd overall. 
Russell County Thank you to the many residents of Russell for joining me as I continued my Kansas Listening Tour. During this meeting, I discussed how the Senate is getting back to regular order by passing separate appropriations bills and provided an update on the upcoming confirmation hearing for Judge Kavanaugh. We also discussed the uncertainty that comes with the loss of commodity markets during escalating trade tensions, and the generational effects that trade could have on rural Kansas, as well as issues related to veterans healthcare, our immigration system and school safety. 
Thank you to the Russell Chamber of Commerce and Espresso Etc. for hosting me and to Representative Troy Waymaster for attending. 
￼ 
McPherson County I appreciate the many McPherson residents who took time to join my townhall meeting on Saturday. Folks were particularly interested in hearing more about recent action on trade and tariffs and shared their frustration regarding the consequences that decisions made in Washington have on rural America. 
Thank you to The Cedars for hosting my visit to McPherson and to Mayor Tom Brown for attending. Thanks also to Miriam Hoover for attending the townhall meeting just a few weeks shy of her 100th birthday. 
￼
Trego County During my Listening Tour stop in Trego County, I visited with employees of Western Cooperative Electric (WCE) in WaKeeney. WCE maintains over 4,000 miles of power lines and employs over 50 people in Northwest Kansas. I appreciate the many people who took time to visit with me on important issues facing rural Kansas and our nation.
￼ 
Community Visits to Dorrance and Bunker Hill Prior to my townhall meetings on Friday, I made stops in Dorrance and Bunker Hill to visit with folks on Main Street and at various businesses and organizations around town. Thanks to the area residents, business owners and local leaders who took time out of their day to give me their thoughts on a variety of issues and allowing me to visit with them on the work I’m doing in Washington. 
Attending the FHSU Foundation Annual Board Meeting Reception On Friday evening I attended the Fort Hays State University Foundation's annual board meeting and reception. At the event, we heard updates on various university matters from Foundation President and CEO Jason Williby, FHSU President Dr. Tisa Mason and FHSU Student Body President Adam Schibi. The group also welcomed a group of nine new members to the board of trustees. I was pleased to visit with many long-time friends, former colleagues and fellow Kansans throughout the evening in Hays. 


Now Accepting 2018 Service Academy Applications Appointing Kansans to the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, N.Y.; the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.; the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo; and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, N.Y. is one of my favorite duties as a U.S. Senator. 
To review requirements and move through the application process, please download an application from my website or contact my Olathe office at 913-393-0711. All application materials are due to my Olathe office by September 7, 2018.

The Webster Wire
Listening to Floridians
Dear Friends: 
Saturday, we lost an American patriot. John McCain gave his entire life serving his country. We owe him a debt of gratitude. The entire McCain family is in my thoughts and prayers as we mourn his passing and celebrate his life. 
_______________ 
Last Monday, I traveled the Sumter Scenic Heritage Byway, 62 miles of roadway that showcases local businesses, fields, cattle ranches, farms, and communities in Sumter County. I met many business owners, vendors, Floridians. We discussed the work of Congress and the issues that are impacting them from taxes, regulations, farm subsidies, and more. 
￼ ￼ 
_______________ 
I visited the Florida Bass Conservation Center located at the old Richloam Hatchery, Florida’s major freshwater fish production hatchery. It supplies fish such as largemouth bass, crappie, catfish, bream, triploid grass carp, striped bass, and sunshine bass. The Center also conducts research on aquaculture methods.
￼ ￼ 
_______________ 
I met with United Agricultural Services to learn more about their work to provide sustainable agricultural solutions to farmers. 
￼ 
_______________ 
Wednesday, I was honored to speak at the August Monthly Hernando Chamber Membership Breakfast and present backpacks and school supplies to United Way of Hernando County for Stuff the Bus. 
￼ ￼ 
_______________ 
Investing in and improving Florida’s infrastructure is one of my focuses as I serve on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Located at the geographic center of Florida, the Brooksville-Tampa Bay Regional Airport & Technology Center is a multi-use aviation facility that’s helping make Central Florida more accessible. It is the largest airport north of the Tampa Bay/St. Petersburg region. 
_______________ 
I toured PACE Center for Girls in Hernando County and learned about how they are empowering middle and high school girls to create a better future. 
￼ ￼ 
_______________ 
I had a wonderful time visiting Pana Vista Lodge and Fish Camp which dates to the 1880s when it was a plantation home. It became a hotel in the 1920s and is still operated today as an old-fashioned Florida fish camp. 
￼ ￼ 
_______________
I also had a great discussion with Mark Harold from Webster Farmer’s Market about important agricultural issues in Florida including produce and cattle stock.

Constituent Corner
A constituent from Homosassa was informed by the VA of a debt totaling more than $46,000 had been created when his income had been miscalculated. A request for a waiver of the debt had been submitted and my office followed up with the VA’s Debt Management Center (DMC) on behalf of the constituent. We received correspondence which appeared to have contradictory statements, so calls were made to DMC for clarification. At that time, it was learned a partial waiver had been granted but a second debt was incurred when collections had been put on hold while DMC was considering the waiver. A request was made for a written explanation of the current balance, and it was a pleasure to learn the entire debt had been waived. 
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.

A Week in Review
This past weekend, our country lost an American war hero and a statesman who dedicated his life to serving a country that he deeply loved. No words can describe the loss of Senator John McCain, a man who I’ve had the honor of serving with in the United States Senate. He fiercely advocated for our veterans and all of those who continue to defend our freedoms today. I join my colleagues in mourning the passing of our friend, and Lynne and I continue to pray for Cindy and the entire McCain family.
Meeting with Arnold Stalk of Veterans Village 
￼ 
Click  HERE to view a video recapping my meeting with Arnold Stalk.   
I recently met with Arnold Stalk, a local advocate for Nevada’s veteran community, visited my Washington, D.C. office. Arnold is the man behind Veterans Village, a nonprofit organization in Las Vegas that works to provide essential resources, including housing, health services, and food, to Nevada’s veterans in need.
Arnold and Veterans Village are critical in our fight to ensure that our veterans are well taken care of and have access to housing and day-to-day resources. Our discussion was another reminder that while we have made great progress, there is still more work to be done for our veterans. When the VA Secretary comes to Las Vegas, I want him to talk to Arnold, as well as every other service organization that’s out there that really works closely with veterans. Click HERE to watch a video that recaps my meeting with Arnold.
Legislative Update
On the legislative front – this past week, the U.S. Senate passed measures that  I authored to help Nevada’s veterans find jobs, promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs that benefit pre-kindergarden-12 students, and support babies born dependent on opioids or other substances.  Additionally, I joined my colleagues in introducing the Ensuring Coverage for Patients with Pre-Existing Conditions Act, legislation that would guarantee Americans have equal health care coverage, regardless of their health status or pre-existing conditions.
I’m also pleased to report that four Nevada Fire Agencies – the Central Lyon County Fire Protection District, the Elko County Fire Protection District, Nye County Emergency Management, and the Reno Fire Department – have been awarded competitive grants totaling over $1.5 million to support Nevada’s fire departments . These resources will go a long way toward providing critical support and additional opportunities to ultimately enable Nevada’s fire departments to hire highly trained individuals, and I look forward to continue to push for policies that support our brave firefighters who work hard to keep our families and communities safe. 
  
  
  
  
Visit to the Washoe County Sheriff's Office
On Friday,  I visited the Washoe County Sheriff’s Office Forensic Science Division, which provides forensic services for 13 of the state’s 17 counties, to discuss Nevada’s progress in reducing the number of untested sexual assault kits.  According to a recent report, as of June 30th, 6,367 of the Nevada untested backlogged kits had been sent to labs for testing, and 4,871 – or 63 percent - had completed the testing process. Out of those kits that completed the testing process, the DNA has hit a match in 466 of the cases and at least 12 arrests have been made in Nevada as a result.
￼ 
The Washoe County Sheriff's Office Forensic Science Division expects to finish its backlog of untested rape kits by spring of 2019. I was proud to help pass my bill - the SAFER Act - into law earlier this year to help law enforcement in their efforts to test, track and audit these kits. 
As a strong supporter of authoring and supporting legislation to fund grant programs that allow our law enforcement and forensic experts to continue their operations, I’ve helped introduce and navigate into law bipartisan legislation called the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting (SAFER) Act, as well as the  Debbie Smith Crime Victims Protection Act, legislation that reauthorizes the Debbie Smith Act and dedicates much-needed resources to state and local law enforcement agencies to conduct forensic analyses of crime scenes, including untested rape kits. I remain committed to doing everything I can to secure continued federal resources for this division, and all labs in Nevada.
￼ 
Forensic Science Division Director Kerri Heward, Dr. Lisa Smyth-Roam and Brittney Chilton are helping bring justice to victims of these vile crimes through their work at the Washoe County Sheriff’s Office forensic lab. 
As always, it’s an honor to represent you in the U.S. Senate. I have offices in Reno, Las Vegas, and Washington, D.C., and I encourage you to  contact us  –  we’re here to help you .

August 27, 2018
Hello friends, 
I can’t believe it is almost September. We’re dusting off our backpacks and lunchboxes in the Kilmer household, figuring out that first day outfit and stocking up on school supplies for the year ahead.  
Across the region, college students are packing the car, and teachers are putting the final touches on their classrooms.
As we gear up for another year and students everywhere recommit to doing their best (and savor these final evenings without homework), it is a great time discuss the work Congress needs to do to ensure people get a top-notch education. 
Working for Teachers  
Last week I met with about 800 teachers from across Kitsap County gearing up for this year.  
We talked about how Congress can do more to make one of the most important jobs in America a little easier.  
Consider this quote from a policy researcher at Third Way: 
         “The average teacher coming out of school with a master’s degree in education today owes          approximately $50,000 in student loan debt. To put that in perspective, that’s $8,000 more than          the average debt for a candidate with a newly-minted MBA. Yet the average salary for this same          master’s degree-holding teacher within their first five years of their career is less than $46,000.” 
That doesn’t seem right. As the son of two school teachers, I admire the important work done by those who spend every day in the classroom investing in our kids. Folks shouldn’t have to think twice about whether teaching is a career path they can afford. 
One way Congress could help right now is by passing the Teacher Loan Repayment Act, a bipartisan bill I introduced with Representative Susan Brooks from Indiana. Our bill would simplify and strengthen the existing student loan repayment programs that are complicated and inadequate. That would help teachers better afford their degrees and enable them to go into their chosen profession.
￼ 
I also visited the Peninsula School District’s Back to School event and visited with the new Superintendent, Art Jarvis. Welcome aboard Art! 
Making College More Affordable 
Not everyone is going to go to college. But we know that more and more jobs will likely require a degree or certification beyond high school. That’s just one reason why Congress should make pursuing additional education more affordable. 
We know as educational levels rise, so do incomes.  
Education opens the door to opportunity. For many folks, including yours truly, financial aid is the key to that door. But our financial aid programs aren’t keeping pace with the rising costs of college.  
That’s why I introduced the Opportunities for Success Act, which reforms the Federal Work Study program.  
And, Congress can do far more to ensure that students can get a quality degree without ending up deep in debt, including modernizing the Pell Grant program. 
￼ 
Big thanks to Dorian and Miranda, interns that I got to meet at Fred Hutch when I took a tour a few days ago. 
Creating a 21st Century Workforce  
I’m working hard on opening doors to education because I think Congress needs to do a whole lot more to create more economic opportunity for more people in more places.  
A few days ago, I called for a new national focus on workforce development at the Association of Washington Business Federal Affairs Summit in Tacoma. 
I talked about how Washington is the nation’s #1 importer of talent.  
That means more people from out of state are filling the open jobs in Washington than any other state (which is also contributing to our skyrocketing housing prices).  
It means in too many towns in Washington, the largest export is our kids seeking opportunities somewhere else.  
There’s so much Congress can do on this front. I’m pushing for Washington, DC to invest more in apprenticeships, help connect folks to the skilled trades, and to expand shop class and other career and technical education programs. In fact, in the weeks ahead, I’ll be introducing a new bill to provide more federal support to K-12 schools for career-connected learning programs that help young people develop skills that can lead to a job. 
I also introduced the bipartisan Skills Investment Act, so folks can build funds over the course of their careers and use them to learn a new skill if they’re out of work or want to change gears in their career.
You can learn a little more about the AWB’s summit here. 
￼
Making Smart Decisions for our Economy  
Finally, part of making progress for our economy means protecting the jobs we have.  
I’ve written before about my concerns regarding the Trump Administration’s proposal to expand offshore drilling. I’m concerned that such an expansion could not only cause environmental damage – it could hurt our fisheries, our shellfish growers, and our tourism industry.  
Last week at Rialto Beach, I joined Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson as well as Quinault Indian Nation President Fawn Sharp and members of our community to send a loud and clear message that Washington’s waters should be off limits to offshore drilling. Our state’s coastal waterways and oceans support 560,000 jobs and a $26 billion economy. We shouldn’t undermine that.  ￼ 
I also traveled to Aberdeen, where I talked with local businesses about the need for smart policy decisions in DC when it comes to trade.  
Trade policy isn’t an abstract DC debate. The uncertainty caused by the mounting trade war has real impacts in our region. As I heard during my visit to the offices of Greater Grays Harbor Incorporated, these tariffs mean fewer orders for businesses in Cosmopolis and retaliatory markups on steel and sodium which makes it costlier to manufacture goods in Montesano and Elma. 
All of that could mean higher prices, smaller paychecks and fewer jobs.  
Good trade policy means more people around the world buying products stamped “Made in Washington.” I spoke with The Daily World about my meeting and the path forward.  
Working for You 
It’s been a busy two weeks traveling across the region. Here’s what else I’ve been up to: 
Honoring those who serve 
Last week in Elma I had the privilege of hosting a pinning ceremony for Vietnam veterans as part of the national commemoration of the Vietnam War. I was able to present a commemorative pin to 63 veterans in front of a large crowd at the Elma Eagles Club. To all who served: thank you. 
￼ 
Visiting Harbor Roots Farm 
I had a great time touring the Harbor Roots Farm, which runs a sustainable farming apprenticeship program for folks looking for new skills and a job. Thanks for having me and for the great work you’re doing.
￼ 
Kilmer at Your Companies 
I hosted a whole bunch of Kilmer at Your Company visits over the last couple of weeks. I stopped into Grifols Biomat, Sound Credit Union, Startup253, and the Odd Otter in Tacoma. On Bainbridge, I visited Storyville Coffee Company and Office XPats. And I had an awesome tour of the Overstock.com facility in Elma, which opened last year and now employs more than 150 people. 
￼ 
Talking Farm Policy in Kitsap 
I talked about the Farm Bill with some awesome farmers who work with the Kitsap Community and Agricultural Alliance and the Kitsap Conservation District. Big thanks to the Full Tilth Farm, Around the Table Farm, and Pheasant Fields Farm for hosting me. 
￼ 
Celebrating Local Culture 
In addition to hitting a whole bunch of county fairs over the last couple of weeks, I enjoyed heading out to Neah Bay this past weekend for Makah Days. Sophie and I had fun participating in the annual parade, taking part in the ceremonial flag raising, eating some delicious salmon and fry bread, and enjoying an extraordinary celebration of the Tribe’s culture and heritage.  
￼ 
OK - that’s it for this update. Please holler if I can ever lend a hand. As always, it’s my honor to represent you. 
Sincerely,
Derek

Cracking Down on Overdraft Fees 

 ￼
  ￼
  ￼
  ￼
Bank executives shouldn’t be allowed to scam hardworking families to pay for a CEO’s yacht. But that’s what’s happening as expensive, unexpected overdraft fees are costing too many Americans.   Overdraft protection used to be a free perk, understanding that sometimes mistakes happen – a bank transfer takes longer than someone expects, or a paycheck is delayed because of a holiday. Allowing customers to make purchases anyway, by temporarily overdrawing their account, helped many families.  But the same big banks that have gotten rid of free checking accounts have turned overdraft protection into huge profits – on the backs of hardworking Ohioans.  Rather than overdraft protection helping families avoid a bounced check, like it used to, banks now charge automatic fees whenever someone overdraws their account – and those fees are getting higher and higher.   Banks also regularly reorder transactions to generate the highest possible fees for the bank – and the highest possible cost to the customer. That’s right – banks are exploiting Ohio customers by going in and manipulating their accounts, ripping them off with higher fees than they should be charged.  And often banks bury the possibility of these charges in the fine print of account agreements. TCF Bank recently agreed to pay back $25 million to consumers it tricked into signing up for expensive overdraft products by misleading customers into believing they had to sign up for it in order to open an account. 
That’s why this month, I introduced the Stop Overdraft Profiteering Act, to protect Ohioans’ hard earned paychecks. 
My bill requires banks to process transactions in a way that minimizes overdraft fees, requires those fees be reasonable, and limits the number of fees that can be charged. It would ban overdraft fees on debit card transactions and ATM withdrawals altogether, and ensure that overdraft fees on rent and utility payments are fair and affordable.  These fees are a tax on paychecks that are already stretched thin.   Banks should be set up to serve customers – not scam them to pad their CEOs’ bottom-lines. Our bill will work to change that.  Sherrod

Visiting Fulton & Alsbury Academy
On Monday, I had lunch at the Fulton and Alsbury Academy in Lancaster. Dr. Andrew Glatfelter, the Principal, hosted the event, as 7th grader Valarie wanted to interview me. She has an interest in politics and had asked for me to visit her school. We spoke about many aspects of politics and leadership. I learned that Valarie had already completed a computer science course offered by Harvard University. Her aspirations are to attend Harvard after she graduates from high school. Valarie shared with me how her mother encourages her to work hard and make her dreams come true. Thank you to Mr. Glatfelter for hosting a very uplifting event.
￼

Speaking with students
After lunch I was asked to speak to the entire 8th grade class at the Fulton and Alsbury Academy. We had a very productive question and answer period. Some of the topics covered included pollution, gun regulations, veterans, border security and drug trafficking. These students were very aware of the issues of today along with being very articulate. Check out this great write-up on my visit for more.

Thank you to the Vons store on Alamo Street in Simi Valley for inviting me on Thursday to come and learn about all the great services you provide like free eating healthy tours of the store, diabetes education and support, health screenings, medication therapy management and immunizations to name a few. The majority of our discussions focused on the opioid abuse epidemic solutions such as a 7-day supply limit for the prescribers of intimal opioid prescriptions and the creation of a national prescription drug monitoring program.
￼

New AVTA bus route
On Thursday, a member of our staff was at the official opening of a new bus stop in Palmdale, at Avenue O-8 and Sierra Highway. AVTA is offering this new service to help residents travel economically to this location and use the services offered there.

John McCain: An American Hero

Women's Equality Day
Women's Equality Day reminds us that we still have a long way to go in ensuring equality in the workplace. While we have made some progress on this issue, we must keep striving to increase economic opportunities and address the barriers that many women still face today. That is why I had introduced the “Workplace Advancement Act”, that would empower individuals to negotiate their salaries more effectively by preventing retaliation against employees who inquire about or discuss workplace salaries. It would also reaffirm Congressional commitment to the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, existing laws that ban gender discrimination. This bill would help to ensure women are able to earn the salaries they deserve. Read more here

The nation mourns today as we remember Senator John McCain. Senator McCain was a patriot and hero who served our country in uniform and in the Senate with extraordinary courage, passion, sacrifice, and integrity. I join with his family, his friends, our colleagues in the Senate, and all Americans in mourning the passing of one of the finest leaders our nation has produced. We can honor his life and legacy by ensuring America continues to lead from a position of strength and principle – standing up for freedom, the oppressed, the dispossessed, and the rule of law.

Our Fallen Heroes 
Hoosiers and Congress are working to honor our fallen heroes. 
Last week, the Senate voted to increase funding to recover and identify our fallen service members. I was proud to cosponsor and vote for this amendment that will help provide the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency with the resources needed to fulfill its mission.

Combatting the Drug Epidemic 
As the drug epidemic continues to ravage communities in Indiana and across the country, we must take steps to understand all aspects of this crisis. That’s why I Introduced a bill requiring the Surgeon General to report to Congress the health effects of synthetic drugs. This bipartisan bill will help provide the tools needed to comprehend this growing trend and help protect Hoosiers. 
Hoosier Nominee
On Thursday, I chaired the confirmation hearing for Kip Tom of Leesburg to be Ambassador and U.S. Representative to the UN Agencies for Food and Agriculture. Kip is uniquely qualified with over four decades of domestic and international food and agriculture experience. I wrote a letter to the President last year recommending that he nominate Kip for this position. 
During the hearing, I discussed international food security issues with Kip. In his opening statement, Kip detailed his Indiana roots, experience, and desire to serve in the position. Watch the video here. 
 ￼ 
Protecting U.S. National Security 
It is said that an ‘ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,’ and that is exactly why I introduced bipartisan legislation to improve the coordination of U.S. government efforts to reduce violence and instability in fragile countries. Smart, proactive and strategic investments earlier will prevent our service members – including Hoosiers – from having to deploy into harm’s way later when violence and instability worsens. A summary of the bill is available here. 
Judge Kavanaugh's Undeniable Qualifications  
On Tuesday, I spoke on the Senate floor to share Judge Brett Kavanaugh's undeniable qualifications. I had the opportunity to sit down with Judge Kavanaugh in my office last month, and he struck me as a man of great character and integrity. He answered questions directly. He spoke forthrightly. He demonstrated, at once, a strong intellect and a deep humility. Watch my floor speech by clicking the image below.

Last week the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy rule. This is encouraging news for Indiana, where we prioritize affordable, reliable, and clean energy. President Obama’s misguided ‘Clean Power Plan’ failed to consider input from energy producing states like ours, and mandated a burdensome one-size-fits-all approach. In the House, I voted to repeal the harmful ‘Clean Power Plan,’ and I am pleased that an alternative has been introduced that takes into account Hoosier concerns.
ICYMI: My Kokomo Tribune Op-Ed 
My Op-Ed in Wednesday’s Kokomo Tribune highlights the need for a National Economic Security Strategy that focuses on China’s predatory economic practices and protects the prosperity and security of Americans. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I’ve lead bipartisan efforts to require a National Economic Security Strategy. Read it here or by clicking the image below.

Dear fellow South Carolinians,  Thank you for subscribing to my weekly e-newsletter, and please remember to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.  
 Remembering John McCain As you most likely know, U.S. Senator John McCain passed away over the weekend. John McCain is an American hero who leaves a long legacy of service. It was truly an honor to work under his Chairmanship at the Senate Armed Services Committee, and to get to know him over my five years in the Senate. My prayers are with Cindy, Meghan, and the entire McCain family. 
Remembering Aretha Franklin Aretha Franklin was a visionary. Her music inspired change, stirred hearts and minds, and influenced generations to come. We lost the Queen of Soul, but Heaven gained the voice of an angel. May God bless her legacy! You can read my full statement, and the resolution the Senate passed honoring her legacy, here. 
National Senior Citizens Day Last Tuesday, we celebrated National Senior Citizens Day. I’m grateful for the shared moments with my grandfather growing up. He was the best role model for me and my brother, and I miss him dearly. You can watch me talk about him in a short video here. 
Sincerely, ￼  Tim

8/27/18 17:05,WEDNESDAY: Service Academy Information Night in Albuquerque,"￼
August 27, 2018
Dear Friend,
My office will host a Service Academy Information Night on Wednesday, August 29, in Albuquerque at the University of New Mexico (UNM). My staff will be on hand to answer questions and give prospective applicants and their families the opportunity to speak with representatives from each military service academy and in-state ROTC programs and learn what is required to submit an application to my office.
Albuquerque - Wednesday, August 29, 2018
WHAT:  Service Academy Information Session WHEN:  From 6 to 8 p.m. WHERE: University of New Mexico, Student Union Building--Ballroom A, Albuquerque, N.M. 87131, free parking at the Cornell Parking Structure for attendees QUESTIONS:  Call my Albuquerque Office at (505) 346-6601
Representatives from the U.S Military Academy (West Point), U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, UNM ROTC, New Mexico State University ROTC, and New Mexico Military Institute will be available to speak with families. 
Each Academy prides itself on producing our nation's next generation of military leaders. Four of the five service academies--U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy, and U.S. Merchant Marine Academy--require a Congressional, Vice-Presidential, or service-connected nomination. The U.S. Coast Guard Academy does not require a nomination.  
Parents or prospective applicants who are unable to attend a service academy information session are encouraged to visit the Academy Nominations page on my website for application deadlines and more information about the nomination process.
I encourage all students who are interested in applying and willing to put forth significant time and effort to do so. Being nominated is a significant honor and the application process is rigorous. It is important to continue to strengthen our proud military history by providing each United States Service Academy with the most qualified and meritorious candidates. 
Sincerely,
￼

Legislative Work  - Olson Amendment to H.R. 8 – Requires the Army Corps to expedite authorized projects in areas hit by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria - McCaul Amendment to H.R. 8 – Expedites study for the 3rd reservoir - H.R. 3940 Veterans Education Disaster Assistance Act (Poe) - H.R. 3238 Disaster Assistance Equity Act (Sanford)  Letters to the Administration  - Houston delegation letter to FEMA to request FEMA speed up home inspection - Houston delegation letter to FEMA to request FEMA extend the disaster assistance appeal timeline from 60 to 90 days - Houston delegation letter to OMB to urge the release of supplemental funding to Texas and the Houston region for Army Corps projects  
Dear Friend,  A year ago, Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc on our Houston region, dumping nearly 60 inches of rain, claiming 88 lives and causing billions of dollars worth of damage. Through it all, Texans came together to help their friends, neighbors and even strangers and showed the country and world the true meaning of #HoustonStrong. We also saw the humanity of our neighbors across the nation who stepped up to help in our time of need. While there is still much work to be done, here is an update on my work in Congress to help folks recover and prepare for the next storm.   Securing Funds for Disaster Recovery Projects   We worked hard at the federal level to secure critical resources for recovery. Congress passed more than $100 Billion in aid for Hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma, and the California wildfires. This included needed emergency for funding for FEMA, SBA & HUD to help rebuild communities like ours. I also successfully passed an amendment to help expedite previously approved projects in storm ravaged areas. We need to cut barriers to flood prevention. My Houston colleagues and I were able to secure $537 million for Army Corps disaster recovery projects in the Houston area. That includes: 
	•	$295.162 million for the Clear Creek flood damage reduction project, which will help prevent future flooding of several thousand homes and significantly reduce future flooding
	•	$13.122 million for construction and repairs to the Buffalo Bayou and Tributaries flood damage reduction project, including the Addicks and Barker Dams
	•	$3 million for the Brazos River Erosion Management Study for Fort Bend County to make flood plains and local infrastructure more resilient
	•	$6 million for a study to explore options to reduce flood risk in the Buffalo Bayou basin, including the Addicks and Barker Dams
	•	$12 million for studies to identify flood risk management options and determine additional ways to reduce flooding risks in the Houston area
	•	$30 million for maintenance dredging of the Houston Ship Channel
Disaster Relief Bills Signed Into Law  In the aftermath of Harvey, I worked with my colleagues in the House and the Senate to secure critical disaster response, relief and recovery funding for our region. Congress passed, and the president signed multiple bills to ensure these funds help keep folks protected from future storms and flooding. 
	•	H.R. 601 includes $15.25 billion in emergency funding for FEMA, SBA and HUD for initial response and recovery efforts after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma
	•	H.R. 3823 provides tax relief for victims of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria
	•	H.R. 2266 provides $18.7 billion for FEMA’s disaster relief fund
	•	H.R. 1892 provides $90 million in disaster relief funding, including the Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery Program, and a separate $15 billion for crucial Army Corps Projects
	•	S. 1182 extends the National Flood Insurance Program through November 30, 2018 so that folks are protected during the 2018 hurricane season
	•	H.R. 4430 gives the Department of Health and Human Services temporary authority to directly appoint critical emergency response staff
If you need help or have questions about any Harvey related issues, please contact my office. My staff is more than happy to help however they can to resolve these problems. Finally, as we are in the midst of hurricane season, click here for tips on hurricane preparation. 
I’m honored to represent you in Congress. For more information on current legislation, constituent services, or to sign up for my E-newsletter, please visit my website, www.olson.house.gov.   Very respectfully, Pete Olson

Dear Friend, 
Each August, I relish my time spent at home, meeting with friends and neighbors in local small businesses, union halls, and at organizations that service our community. Nothing makes me happier than the chance to speak directly with many of you. Now, as teachers, parents, and students prepare for the excitement and changes of the coming school year, I would like to take the opportunity to discuss some of the work I am doing to try and improve our nation's education system.
Access to safe, stable learning environments allow our next generation to achieve their goals. That is why I believe we should make investments to upgrade school infrastructure, safeguard classrooms, and provide our children with the tools they need to thrive. I continue to fight for legislation that I introduced to combat bullying in our schools and to ensure schools have enough counselors to guide students through their development into young adults. Recently, I also introduced legislation to expand school mental health services, helping more students get the support they need. 
Every student deserves great teachers, school counselors, and administrators to help them live up to their potential. We need to recruit a talented, diverse workforce of teachers and retain the excellent teachers we have. Teachers should be compensated fairly for the important work they do and guaranteed the right to organize and negotiate for higher wages.
Lastly, students seeking higher education should not be crippled with massive student loan debt upon graduating. This Congress, I successfully fought to restore the summer Pell Grant, which helps millions of students earning a degree quicker without having to take out additional student loans. I also support legislation to lower interest rates and allow recent graduates to refinance their federal loans at a lower rate.
As I head back to Washington, I remain as committed as ever to enhancing our education system, bettering the lives of families in our district. If you did not get the opportunity to attend one of my events this August, please do not hesitate to share your thoughts with me on how I can best represent you.
Sincerely, ￼  Linda Sánchez Member of Congress

Highlights from the District
￼
After helping the Water Replenishment District of Southern California secure $4.3 million in federal funding for its Groundwater Reliability Improvement Project, I stopped by this month to tour the state-of-the-art facility in Pico Rivera.
When it is finished, the Albert Robles Center will help provide our community with a clean, sustainable source of water for years to come. Conservation projects like this provide a win-win for both the environment and ratepayers.
  
  
  
￼ 
Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to attend several National Night Out events in Bellflower, Montebello, and Norwalk. These community events were a great opportunity to bring together local businesses and law enforcement to discuss our joint commitment to make our neighborhoods safer, more caring places to live. 
￼
I also had the opportunity to speak with business leaders in our community at a State of the Nation Luncheon this month in Norwalk. 
I updated attendees on current events in Washington and shared the work I am doing at the federal level to address our local transportation and infrastructure woes and to help foster business development in our community.
  
  
  
  
￼
On August 10, I held my 16th annual Senior Fair at Cerritos Community College. Everyone was able to take advantage of free health screenings, information on veterans’ benefits, assistance with federal agencies, and much more. I am always thrilled to put on this event, and I want to thank Cerritos Community College for being such hospitable hosts, as well as all of the vendors and seniors who were able to join us.

It's Time to End the War in Afghanistan - Not Privatize it for Corporate Profit
￼  Billionaire Erik Prince, who founded a private security firm called Blackwater, later renamed Academi, obtained large contracts to provide security in Iraq after the U.S. invaded  that nation in 2003. In 2007, a group of Blackwater employees were convicted of killing 14 unarmed Iraqi civilians in Baghdad. The President is now reportedly considering a plan by Prince to form a private army, paid for with U.S. taxpayer dollars, to take over the war in Afghanistan.  
Dear Friend,  
After almost 17 years, it’s time to bring American troops home from Afghanistan and put an end the longest war in our Nation’s history. The Founders established America’s military for our own national defense – not as a force to be spread around the world propping up corrupt dictatorships under the guise of fighting terrorism. And not to be deployed anywhere without the consent of Congress, a clear definition of “victory,” and a strategy for achieving it.   What’s more, it’s time for the President to flatly and permanently reject a reckless plan he is reportedly considering to privatize the Afghan conflict, and turn the U.S role over to billionaire war profiteer Erik Prince, 6000 mercenary fighters, and a 90 plane private air force paid for with American taxpayer dollars. As bad ideas go, this one sits at or near the top of the list.   First and foremost, it would be immoral and wrong for our Nation to ever support or be involved in a war waged solely for private profit – where those in charge only make money by perpetuating an endless conflict at a cost of tens of thousands of civilian lives and terrible destruction. That’s not who we are as Americans.   And to be clear, no private contractor should ever be permitted to make national security decisions for the United States, either at home or abroad. Yet under Prince’s plan, the President would appoint a special “envoy” to command the operation and somehow rally the Afghan people and their army to defeat the Taliban and end Afghanistan’s civil war. If we have learned nothing else from endless wars of choice in the Middle East that will, according to credible estimates, cost our Nation nearly $16 trillion over the next three decades, along with thousands of precious lives, it’s that civil wars can’t be settled by outside forces.   Last but far from least, an unchecked private army, supported by the U.S. and let loose in Afghanistan, would be far more likely to exploit local resources and cause needless loss of civilian lives to run up the profits. The result would be even more hostility toward America, with more young people encouraged to join the Taliban and other terrorist groups. Congress must not and cannot permit this to happen. 
We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email. 
Sincerely,  ￼ 

Congress Must Prevent Presidential Interference With Mueller Investigation 
￼  The late Republican Senator John McCain hit the nail on the head with this tweet. 
Congress needs to ensure that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in our 2016 elections will proceed without interference by the President or anyone else. When the integrity of our elections is undermined by a foreign government, and when the President of the United States and people close to him may be involved in related crimes and corruption, the American people need to know the truth.    Last week’s tax and bank fraud conviction against the President’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, along with former Presidential attorney Michael Cohen’s guilty plea to campaign law violations, have clearly demonstrated that the Mueller investigation is not a ‘witch hunt’ and must go forward.   That’s why I have cosponsored legislation (H.R. 3654) stipulating that no President will ever have the authority to fire a Special Counsel. Under the measure, a Special Counsel could only be removed if a three-judge panel made a finding of misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.   Would the President sign the bill? Probably not. So the measure would need to pass by veto-proof majorities in both the House and Senate. And in that regard, Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle would do well to note the results of a recent ABC News – Washington Post poll: seven out of 10 Americans support Special Counsel Mueller’s focus on possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians to influence the 2016 election.  

Administration's Dirty Power Plan Would Boost Pollution, Cost Lives, Accelerate Climate Change
￼  The Administration’s new plan to permit greater use of coal for power generation would allow millions more tons of carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the air, accelerating climate change and causing thousands of people to get sick and die.  
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) actually admits it. According to the National Academy of Sciences, the President’s new plan to prop up the coal industry by allowing states to regulate and deregulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants – and use more coal – would cause up to 1,400 premature deaths and 21,000 missed school days every year, accelerate climate change, and release millions more tons of pollutants into the air.   Based on the Academy's analysis, here’s part of the Administration’s actual wording, contained in some 300 pages of small print accompanying the proposal: “Implementing the proposed rule is expected to increase emissions of carbon dioxide and the level of emissions of certain pollutants in the atmosphere that affect human health.”     Specifically, that means more vulnerable Americans would suffer from heart and lung disease, asthma, bronchitis and a host of other conditions that could be avoided by cleaning up the air.   The proposed rule, announced last week, would replace former President Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which would have required states to phase in more wind, solar, and natural gas for power generation, cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 19 percent by 2030. The Academy study also concluded that the Obama clean air plan would have avoided between 1,500 and 3,600 premature deaths annually by 2030, along with 180,000 missed school days.   Luckily, Minnesota power plants are already helping lead the Nation in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, and that is likely to continue. But Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) officials caution that Minnesota’s air could still be affected if other states decide to permit more coal to be used for power generation.  A number of states, along with many environmental groups, are reportedly planning to file suit to stop the Administration from rolling back years of progress in cleaning up our air. Hopefully Minnesota will get on board and help lead the charge.  

You Can't Govern From a Call Center:  It's Time to Put a Stop to Campaign  Fundraising While Congress  is in Session
￼  Click on the screen above and I’ll explain why 24-7 campaign fundraising is damaging Congress’s ability to govern, and people’s confidence in our political system. 
When you go to Washington you should go to work on the people’s business – not raising money for the next election. But the hard cold fact is that many Members of Congress spend more time dialing for dollars than governing. The “People’s House” has become a mid-level telemarketing operation. So our Restore Democracy legislation calls for an end to campaign fundraising by members of Congress and their challengers while Congress is in session.  Congress’s 24/7 fixation on fundraising at the expense of governing is leaving important work undone. Meanwhile, TV ads outside groups purchase with unlimited amounts of secret “dark” money permitted by the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision distort the truth, denigrate candidates, discourage voter turnout and destroy people’s confidence in our public policy making process. Reform must happen for our representative democracy to be real and survive.    That’s why Wisconsin Republican Congressman Mike Gallagher and I are working so hard to build support for our bipartisan Go to Washington – Go to Work Act, which would prohibit Members of Congress or their challengers from making any direct requests for money when Congress is in session. Simply stated, You can’t govern from a Call Center.    The Restore Democracy Revolution   The foundation lies in overturning the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, which has allowed corporations and wealthy special interests to spend unlimited amounts of secret “dark” money to influence elections. Our legislation would also put Congress on record supporting small donor-public campaign financing and limiting the campaign season. Moreover, we are calling for full disclosure of all campaign contributions, establishment of national online voter registration, and a halt to all voter suppression.  We also call for a return to Congress’s traditional process of Regular Order. Under Regular Order, we find common ground and bipartisan solutions by fully considering every idea and amendment under an open rule – and affording each one an up or down vote. That’s how Congress has fixed things, solved problems and gotten things done for more than 250 years. It’s time to get back to that tried and true method of serving the American people.  

Our Week in Baxter 
￼  Community members, law enforcement, emergency responders, and others gathered for Baxter’s Night to Unite picnic. In this photo, Brainerd Firefighters demonstrate how to use a firehose to some young attendees. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tiffany Stenglein captured this action shot. 
Our Week in Brainerd
￼  The Brainerd Veterans Administration (VA) Clinic hosted a Veteran Mental Health and Suicide Awareness Forum. With 20 veterans dying by suicide every day, the VA has made suicide prevention its number one focus. Pictured here, Lisa Bershok describes the differences between male and female veterans in terms of suicide methods. Nolan Congressional Field Representatives John Schrader and Tiffany Stenglein both attended this important event.  
Our Week in Nisswa
￼  The Gull Lake Trail Steering Committee held an open house for people to learn more about the 3.1 mile section of the trail that will run through Nisswa, from the Lakeshore border to the tunnel in downtown Nisswa. In this photo, committee member Gary Johnson shows residents a map of a segment of the proposed route. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tiffany Stenglein attended the meeting on my behalf. 
Our Week in Mora 
￼  The Housing and Redevelopment Authority of Mora invited local community leaders and residents to tour the brand new Mysa House for seniors. The word “Mysa” (pronounced “MEE-sah”) is Swedish but doesn’t have a literal translation in English. Best described, it is a word that portrays the act of being comfortable, cozy, content and relaxed. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen toured the new facility and snapped this photo.   
Our Week in Sandstone 
￼  Pine County Board Chairman Steve Hallan, local residents, and community leaders attended the ground breaking for the new North Pine Government Center in Sandstone. The facility will contain offices for Veterans Services, Health and Human Services, and community meeting rooms. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen attended the event on my behalf. 
Our Week in Virginia 
￼  The Virginia Stand Down for Veterans was held at the Miners Memorial Building in Virginia last week. The event provides military Veterans a chance to utilize free services including Veterans Administration benefits, meals, haircuts, support services, mental health services, clothing, legal aid services, and many other important resources to help Veterans in rural areas. The event was put on by the Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) organization, which hosts Stand Downs throughout Minnesota.  
￼  Veteran service organization representatives (from left to right) Ted Ells, St. Louis County Veteran Service Officer Director, Larry Pocrnich, United for Veterans representative, and Master Sargent Brian Tammi pose for a picture at the Veterans Stand Down in Virginia. 

Finally...
Greetings From Duluth in Summer 
￼  Beautiful in any season, the City of Duluth and its skyline are particularly striking in late summer, just before the leaves begin to turn. Our District Director, Jeff Anderson, snapped these shots last week.  
The Duluth Seaway Port Authority has been the backbone of our region's economy for more than century. Long  known as the Great Lakes ""bulk cargo capital,"" the port accommodates the maritime transportation needs of a wide range of Minnesota industries ranging from agriculture, forestry, mining and manufacturing to construction, power generation, and passenger cruising. 
By far, the largest and busiest on the Great Lakes, the Port of Duluth-Superior handles an average of 35 million short tons of cargo and nearly 900 vessel visits each year, connecting the heartland of the U.S. and Canada to the rest of the world.

Dear Friends, 
Our nation lost a true American hero on Saturday when Senator John McCain passed away after a courageous fight against aggressive brain cancer.  He brought to this last battle the same dignity and grace with which he lived his entire life, a life dedicated to service to his country and his fellow Americans. As a Prisoner of War in Vietnam, as a US Senator, as a candidate for President, he always put service to others before himself. We are a stronger nation because of his service, and he leaves behind a worthy legacy of courage, honor and devotion. Today, as much as any time in our history, we could use more statesmen like him. I offer my sincere condolences to his family and loved ones. 
Last week was another busy week in and around the district.  The highlights of the week for me was visiting with students as they started the new school year.  I had a wonderful conversation with the AP Government class at Buffalo Grove High School.  And I followed that up with what can only be described as a full scale town hall conversation with the entire Caruso Middle School—that is every 6th, 7th, and 8th grade student at the school.  The hour-long assembly ended well before the young people ran out of questions.  I look forward to continuing these school visits throughout the year. 
Looking to the week ahead, we’re continuing our active series of summer events.  This morning I kicked of a tour of local businesses throughout the district who have been affected by the Trump Administration’s trade policies. These visits are great opportunities to hear first hand about both the opportunities and the challenges facing Tenth District companies and their employees, and to explore ways Congress can make a positive impact on our economic outlook.
Tonight I am hosting a panel discussion at College of Lake County on Alzheimer’s to help educate caregivers about navigating the available resources available to them.  This Thursday I will be in Vernon Hills for a documentary screening and discussion on the opioid epidemic. Then, this Saturday, I’m hosting our next Congress on Your Corner in North Chicago – I hope you’ll join us!  You can see our full calendar on our website at schneider.house.gov/events  
  
PUSHING FOR AN END TO CITIZENS UNITED 
The Citizens United decision unlocked unlimited and unaccountable money that is a corrupting influence in our politics. As the Senate considers a new Justice for the Supreme Court, it’s time for Congress to revisit this decision and act to return needed transparency to our campaign finance system. Read my recent op-ed in The Hill with former Representative Ron Barber about steps we can take to ensure big money interests don’t drown out the voices of American voters.

Last week, I rode the Pace Suburban Bus route 570 from College of Lake County in Grayslake to Fox Lake and back to catch up with constituents during their afternoon commute.

Reclaiming Damaged Land for New Use
Recently, I’ve participated in the announcement of five projects that will repurpose old coal mine lands for a variety of uses, from economic development to recreation. Securing federal money for these projects has been a priority of mine in the House of Representatives, and it has been a multi-year process.
Money for abandoned mine land (AML) reclamation for Kentucky, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania has been included in the spending bills that come to the House floor. While those states have more sites needing cleanup, Virginia’s legacy of mining also includes sites that need restoration.
In the previous two years, I have offered an amendment that would provide $10 million each to Virginia, Ohio, and Alabama for reclamation as well. These amendments were included in the spending bills signed into law.
This year, I again put forward this amendment and the House approved it. Although a final version of the spending bill has not been sent to the President’s desk, I am confident this latest installment of $10 million in reclamation funding for Virginia will be approved. It would be added to the $20 million already secured. And the sites eligible for it are clustered in the Ninth District.
Further, the pilot project supported by my amendment is in addition to the existing AML program, which cleans up coal mine sites abandoned before August 3, 1977, but aims to address hazards and environmental degradation – not development for economic use. The pilot project applies funding for both cleanup and economic development.
Funding is now being disbursed by the Treasury to projects, which in Virginia are selected through an application process by the Department of Mines, Minerals, and Energy. Five projects have already been announced which show the array of ways money can be used in reclamation. Jobs, industry, tourism, natural beauty, all benefit from the projects supported by the pilot program.
The grants awarded were:
	•	$3.5 million for a 200-acre industrial park in the City of Norton. The park is a product of regional cooperation in the Lonesome Pine Regional Industrial Facilities Authority (RIFA), which consists of Norton and the Counties of Lee, Scott, Wise, and Dickenson. An unstable highwall will be removed and onsite material will be used for earthwork.
	•	$3,199,553 to create an industrial site in Russell County. The site to be cleaned up once hosted the prominent Moss No. 3 coal preparation plant and a coal fines pit. It will become part of an industrial park encompassing 232 acres. Some old structures will be removed while others, such as rail siding and electric lines, will be repurposed to support the industrial site.
	•	$1.5 million for the Pocahontas Exhibition Mine in Tazewell County. Funding will support improvements to the mine and museum as well as reclamation of adjacent abandoned land for commercial development, enhancing the experience of future visitors. 
	•	$711,100 to close nine old mine portals and convert an access road to a trail that connects with the Cranes Nest Trail in Dickenson County. The Cranes Nest Trail is available for hiking, biking, and equestrian use.
	•	$88,302 to improve the Devil’s Fork Loop Trail in Scott County. The trail showcases the famous Devil’s Bathtub. Funding will close an old mine portal, improve the trail, and expand parking at the site.
At the announcement in Russell County, an official with the U.S. Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement noted that it felt good to reclaim land abandoned mine lands so that they can again be the site of industrial jobs.
That is the point of this program I brought to Virginia. One of the pillars of a strong economy is adaptability. In our part of Virginia, we are taking land that no longer serves its former purpose and recovering them for future use.
The reclamation work itself will create jobs, and the uses the land will be put to, whether industry or tourism, will support jobs and economic growth as well. The economic benefit can be industrial repurposing or tourism. It can be as big as a new industrial park or as simple as parking for a natural attraction.
Southwest Virginia’s way of life is closely tied to the land, which defines our culture and our economy. Federal support for abandoned mine land reclamation will help us define our own future. I am optimistic about the five projects that have been announced and look forward to the benefits they will provide for our communities.

Boy, did the summer fly by! It seems like just yesterday we were helping pick out the kids’ first backpacks. Now, Kassidy is graduated, Kennedy is starting her final semester at SDSU, and Booker is a junior in high school.   
Even during the time my kids have been in school, a lot has changed in education. Through it all, I’ve believed states, school districts, and parents should always have a bigger say over what happens in schools than the federal government. So, when I got to the House, I pushed to secure greater local control on everything from school lunch to funding decisions. 
For instance, last Congress, I helped get legislation signed into law that stopped federal micromanagement, gave states greater flexibility to spend money in a way that benefited their students most, and modernized the Impact Aid program, which many South Dakota schools rely on. Maybe most notably, the new law ensured Washington couldn’t pressure states into adopting rigid academic standards, like Common Core. 
The same philosophy applies to higher education. Last year, I helped the House pass the Strengthening Career and Technical Education Act, which allows states to innovate new learning experiences, better encourage apprenticeships and internships, and develop programs around the local economy’s needs. 
Of course, for some, a tech school or college is out of reach. SDSU is working to do something about that. This August, I met with the school’s president, Barry Dunn, about the Wokini Initative. The effort offers support to Native American students and opens more opportunities for them to get a college degree. I introduced an amendment to the House Farm Bill that helps direct resources to this program. 
Have a wonderful school year!   
-Kristi

8/27/18 12:44,Our Servicemembers Deserve Better,"￼ 
￼
  
Dear Professor  ,
Our servicewomen and men deserve our support for the sacrifices they and their families make for our country.  That means efforts like the recent military pay raise, modern equipment, and sound diplomatic policy. 
Honoring our troops also means protecting them and our veterans from financial abuse.  That is why I authored the bipartisan bill that created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) Office of Service Member Affairs, which works with the Department of Defense to strengthen the Military Lending Act (MLA) and prevent unscrupulous lenders from charging our troops ridiculously high interest rates in excess of the 36 percent cap set by Congress. 
Regrettably, recent reports indicate that the CFPB, under the Trump Administration, wants to roll back military consumer protections under the MLA.  Such a plan is an irresponsible retreat from protecting our men and women in uniform from predatory lending practices.  I recently spoke on the Senate floor on this matter, which you can view here, and I led a letter with 48 of my colleagues that urged the Trump Administration not to abandon its duty to protect our servicemembers and their families as set forth in the MLA. 
Our troops deserve our best, and I will continue my efforts on their behalf. 
Sincerely,
 
Jack Reed
United States Senator

Dear Lindsey, 
Last week, I was joined by the Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Dr. Phil Roe, and Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Chairman Mike Bost, for a VA listening session at the St. Louis Regional Benefits Office and the Jefferson Barracks Division of the St. Louis VA Health Care System. Dr. Roe and Rep. Bost are leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives when it comes to oversight of the VA, and being able to bring them to St. Louis and the Second District shows the importance of these facilities to regional patient care and overall VA benefits. The Regional Benefits Office houses one of the VA’s national call centers, and I was able to see firsthand how the call center staff responds to veterans’ questions. We also met with Director Mitzi Marsh and her leadership team to discuss their progress on implementing important VA legislation such as the Forever GI Bill and the Appeals Modernization Act. Congress must continue to work toward delivering better services to our veterans and holding VA staff accountable for a smooth implementation of these laws. We must streamline the process for veterans and their families to access and utilize education and disability benefits.   At the Jefferson Barracks Division of the St. Louis VA Health Care System, Chairman Roe, Rep. Bost, and I met with Medical Center Director Keith Repko and his staff. We toured the medical center campus including the Spinal Cord Injury Unit and the Domiciliary, which helps homeless veterans receive treatment as they find employment and permanent housing. In the Spinal Cord Unit, we witnessed a demonstration of the ReWalk Program. The St. Louis VA Health Care System is one of fifteen sites across the country selected to participate in a research study with the ReWalk 6.0. I was deeply inspired by Britney, who shared how the device has given her the freedom to walk again. I was also pleased to visit with Stan Brown, President of the Gateway Chapter of the Paralyzed Veterans of America. Stan continues to advocate for veterans with spinal cord injuries and disorders, and I appreciate his dedication to help others.

My staff is always ready to assist if you need help accessing VA benefits or making an appointment at a VA medical center. If you are a veteran and need assistance, please contact my district office at (636) 779-5449. The VA also has a crisis hotline for veterans, service members, and their loved ones, where they can receive confidential support 24/7. The hotline number is (800) 273-8255, or text 838255.
It was also an honor to participate in St. Louis Crisis Nursery’s 30th Annual Celebrity Waiters Night. I previously had the privilege of visiting one of the Crisis Nursery locations and seeing firsthand the care this organization provides the most vulnerable among us. They are committed to preventing child abuse and provide a 24-hour safe shelter and special care for children whose families are facing an emergency situation. Crisis Nursery helps thousands of children a year, and I’m proud to support them and all the wonderful work they are doing in our community.

As students across America are heading back to school, I was reminded of how lucky we are to be home to some of best high schools in the state! The St. Louis Business Journal reported a list of the best high schools in Missouri, both public and private. The top eight public schools in the state were all in the 2nd District: Clayton, Lafayette, Kirkwood, Ladue Horton-Watkins, Marquette, Parkway Central, Parkway West, and Eureka High Schools. The top four private schools were also located in the district: John Burroughs, Saint Louis Priory School, MICDS, and Thomas Jefferson School. Congratulations to the educators across our district and keep up the great work! Our children and community are better off because of you.

Dear Texans, 
As my tour through our district continues, I have had the honor of meeting with so many of you during the past few weeks. My time with constituents, business owners, and military personnel reminds me why Texas is the greatest state in the nation. I've never been more proud to represent the good people of Texas' 25th District, and I cannot wait to take your ideas and concerns back to Washington to fight for you. If you are wondering what I've been up to this August, below is a brief update:  
￼ 
￼ 
As usual, it was great to be in Glen Rose, Texas to meet with local community leaders in Somervell and Johnson County, as well as local senior citizens. From employers to workers, to moms and dads, I appreciated everyone coming out last week. A shared concern among these folks was if this booming economy could sustain this level of growth in the years to come. I promised them I would not stop working on their behalf, and I look forward to returning to Washington to ensure we continue stabilizing the economy in Tax Reform 2.0. 
￼  
For 40 years, Gearench has called Clifton home, and as a leading oil industry manufacturer in Central Texas, I am proud to have them in our district. In a time when the United States is currently ranked third in oil production, businesses like Gearench help pave the road to success. For more information, click here. 
￼ 
I have always been a steadfast supporter of our men and women in law enforcement. I was honored to meet with local police officers of Bosque County and personally thank them for all that they do. In a time when our nation is facing increased threats at home, these brave Americans do not hesitate to protect each of us every day. I am forever grateful for their selfless service, and I will always continue to back the blue. For more, click here. 
￼  
It was great to meet with members of the Copperas Cove Exchange Club and hear their priorities for this community. We discussed what they hope to see by the end of this year, and how Congress can pass effective legislation that benefits all Americans. For more information, click here. 
 ￼ 
The Great Place is made up of some of the finest military men and women this country has ever seen, and I have fought my hardest on their behalf for the past six years. It was a great honor to be with our brave service members last week, and after learning more from them, I am more confident than ever that there is no greater military force in the world. For more information, click here.  
￼ 
Last week, I was able to recognize one of Texas’ very own, MSG (R) Clifton L. Petry, who served in the U.S. Army for over 28 years. For almost three of those years during the Korean War, this hero was taken a Prisoner of War. I commend him, as well as all POWs, for his courage and selflessness throughout that time. I am forever grateful for his service, and it was a privilege to be able to recognize him. Click here for more. 
  ￼ 
I enjoyed meeting with members of the local Marble Falls community last week to talk about what Congress can do better once we return in September. We agreed that a top priority is to make tax cuts permanent for all Americans, and that we must pass Tax Reform 2.0 as quickly as possible. For more information, click here. 
￼ 
It’s always a great to be in Lampasas, Texas, and last week was no exception. I had the opportunity to hear from business leaders in the community, and they expressed to me the benefits they’ve seen from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as the need for permanent tax cuts for all Americans. Click here for more info. 
Army Futures Command Update 
On Friday, I attended the activation ceremony for the Army Futures Command, alongside Secretary of Army, Dr. Mark T. Esper, and the Chief of Staff of Army, General Mark A. Milley. It marked a historic step for the United States Army and the State of Texas. I was proud to work with our military leadership to bring the Army’s modernization mission to Central Texas. 
For nearly two decades, we’ve asked our soldiers to defend America across the globe in complex, uncertain, and challenging environments. Whether tasked with deterring Russian aggression, taking the fight to ISIS in Iraq and Syria, or supporting our partners in Afghanistan, the Army has answered the call. 
Under the leadership of LTG (P) Murray, I am certain that the Army Futures Command will fulfill its mission to modernize the Force and provide our war fighters with the equipment they need to fight and win on any frontier. I am grateful for the warm welcome that Austin has provided, and I am excited for all that Texas will offer our Army.

Dell Children's Medical Center Update 
Last week, it was announced that Dell Medical School at The University of Texas, and the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System (CTVHCS) would partner together to better provide access to care for local veterans. 
This partnership will promote innovative care for Central Texas vets by giving them access to high-quality treatment from world-class doctors and medical professionals. I have had the opportunity to visit and learn from experts on both campuses recently, and I know these establishments are more than capable of exceeding expectations. Our nation's veterans deserve quality care, and I am proud to be a part of this profound movement that will help these selfless men and women get the care they need. For my full statement, click here. 
I have included some articles and releases you may find interesting located on the right side of this newsletter. It is an honor and privilege to represent the people of Texas’ 25th Congressional District and as always, please reach out to me with any issues and concerns that are important to you.
In God we trust,

Wicker Says Senate Is Getting the Job Done on Funding Bills
Lawmakers Have Overcome Past Roadblocks in Exercising ‘Power of the Purse’
The Senate has largely done its part to meet a major deadline, which is only a month away. September marks the end of the fiscal year, when federal funding decisions are due for 2019.
Thanks to bipartisan support for open debate and amendments, many of the funding decisions for next year have already been approved by the full Senate and are well on their way to becoming law.  When the House of Representatives gavels back into session after Labor Day, the Senate will have passed at least 9 of the 12 annual appropriations bills, demonstrating significant and encouraging progress toward restoring regular order to the Senate floor.    
Even some of the most persistent roadblocks have been overcome, such as the spending bill to fund the departments of Health and Human Services, Education, and Labor.  Funding for these departments had not received Senate floor consideration since 2007 but has now been passed by a vote of 85 to 7.
Funding Oversight Is Essential to Constitution’s Checks and Balances
A regular appropriations process is good for the American taxpayer, because the consideration of funding bills individually allows Congress to apply appropriate oversight on government agencies and cut wasteful spending.  Otherwise, the bills are put together in a massive, unwieldy “omnibus” measure to fund the government, which President Trump has said he would not sign again.
It is also critical for Congress to fulfill its unique “power of the purse,” a responsibility granted by the Constitution in its separation of powers.  As representatives of the people, lawmakers are best positioned to identify local needs and direct the appropriate funding toward them.  Likewise, control of the purse can put a check on any excessive spending by executive agencies.  
Bipartisan Cooperation Needed During Consideration of Supreme Court Nominee
Another constitutional duty the Senate is set to fulfill next month is its consideration of Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court seat left vacant by Justice Anthony Kennedy.  I recently spoke on the Senate floor about my support for Judge Kavanaugh, reminding my colleagues of the “advice and consent” that the Constitution asks the Senate to provide for judicial nominees.  
The noise from outside political groups who oppose Judge Kavanaugh should not distract from lawmakers’ full and thorough review of his credentials, which I have found to be impressive.  With 300 published legal opinions, there is no shortage of information on Judge Kavanaugh’s legal philosophy.  However, Democrats continue to make extraordinarily excessive demands in an effort to slow down the confirmation process.  They have requested hundreds of thousands of documents from his career – more than any other previous Supreme Court nominee.
I look forward to the committee hearings and floor debate on Judge Kavanaugh, which are expected in the Senate in the coming weeks.  I am also hopeful my Democratic colleagues will extend the same bipartisan spirit of cooperation to Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation process that has been essential to advancing this year’s appropriations bills.  His many qualifications and well-regarded reputation should speak for themselves.

The Stakes are High A Message from Congressman Butterfield 
Dear Friend- 
Last Tuesday, longtime Trump attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges and implicated President Trump as an unindicted co-conspirator of a federal crime. Meanwhile, White House aides reportedly expressed concern that Trump will pardon former campaign chair Paul Manafort, newly convicted of fraud, after Trump praised his loyalty. And the stakes continue to get even higher as Senate Republicans push forward on President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, scheduling the confirmation hearing for Judge Kavanaugh for September 4.
The stakes are incredibly high and it’s time to fight for what we believe in. So, while I continue to resist the attacks on our democracy and call for Republican leadership in Congress to hold President Trump and his associates accountable, I also continue to push forward a positive agenda to help the people of the First Congressional District succeed. 
That is why I launched my 2018 Jobs & Justice Agenda. With Congress in recess, I spent the last month traveling throughout the First District to hear directly from you on the issues that matter most to our community. 
I am sharply focused on key issues that many North Carolinians say they are impacted by the most:

Ohio Work Period
For the last few weeks, Congressman Davidson crisscrossed the Ohio Eighth District making nearly 60 stops to various meetings, local businesses, schools, non-profits, events, and fairs. 
Throughout the work period he spoke with various Rotary Clubs, Kiwanis Clubs, and small business round-tables in northeastern Cincinnati, Troy, and West Chester. 
In Mercer County, Congressman Davidson toured the CA Group and Kaup Pharmacy. In New Carlisle, he toured HARD Acre Farm, which is a facility that helps people with developmental disabilities.  
While touring the Miami County Fair with members of the Miami County Farm Bureau, Davidson was even presented with the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation’s “Friend of Agriculture” award. He called the award ""an honor"" in a Facebook post. 
Davidson made many other stops too including visits to the Jewish Federation of Greater Dayton, the Great Darke County Fair, and several local schools in Springfield. Davidson spoke about his time in the district during an interview this morning with WCPO in Cincinnati. 
You can learn more about Davidson’s many stops on his Facebook page.  
Congressman Davidson will return to Washington, DC when Congress is in Session next week.

Talking Trade
This week, Congressman Davidson will be joining his colleagues on a trip to China to talk trade. He's passionate about trade and its impact on Ohio families. Davidson recently wrote an op-ed in Washington Times about the issue.  
""A better way on trade""
By Warren Davidson 
Washington Times 
Prior to becoming a congressman in a special election two years ago, I spent 15 years starting, acquiring and growing manufacturing companies. I have experienced bad trade policy firsthand. Consequently, when Donald Trump campaigned on promises to fix our broken trade deals, like most of my colleagues in manufacturing, I was energized. 
Of course, trade affects far more than manufacturing. Ohio’s 8th Congressional District is also one of the top agriculture districts in America. Though smaller and less well known, the region is an innovation hub going back further than the Wright brothers. We know how vital trade is to America’s economic power, and how critical economic strength is to military power. Indeed, before America was powerful militarily, America was powerful economically...Read more here""

Walker Weekly Report
￼
Yesterday, our country lost a true patriot. In his 2008 acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, John McCain said:
""I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else’s. I loved it not just for the many comforts of life here. I loved it for its decency, for its faith in the wisdom, justice, and goodness of its people. I loved it because it was not just a place, but an idea, a cause worth fighting for. I was never the same again; I wasn’t my own man anymore; I was my country’s.""
May we all learn to love our country – and every one of her people – like John McCain did.
We were blessed with valuable time this week in North Carolina, strenghtening existing relationships and building new ones as we hosted a number of events across many of our counties.
Keep reading for the full update. Have a blessed week.  Sincerely, ￼ Mark Walker

HIGHLIGHTS
￼
Hosting More Than A Dozen Events to Hear from Constituents and Businesses of North Carolina on How We Can Serve Them
What a great week spending time with the folks who work hard to serve and grow our community. This week hosted a veterans roundtable with dozens of our heroes and representatives of the VA to learn about how we can improve care and service for our veterans. 
We visited the Nurse Family Partnership Site in Guilford County to learn about their life-saving work, giving new mothers trusted support from a personal nurse throughout the first 1,000 days of the baby's life – from pregnancy until his or her second birthday. We were blessed to meet some of the families to learn about how they have been impacted by the program.
We spent time connecting with the Greensboro Rotary Club and visited Procter and Gamble in Browns Summit to hear from employees and talk about how the company just brought $7 billion in overseas profits back to the United States because of tax reform. We also hosted a non-profit roundtable with more than 30 charities across our state, learning about the challenges they face and how Congress can help them keep improving lives in our communities.
We had the opportunity to speak at the Inaugural Meeting of the Committee on Historically Minority-Serving Institutions and learn how we can help the students they serve. We also took the time to visit North Carolina Central University Campus at the invitation of Chancellor Johnson O. Akinleye to learn about how the Eagle community is serving our state and our nation through research and education (I am looking forward to coming back this fall for a football game).
We gathered pastors from across North Carolina to discuss some of the issues facing our nation and how we can address them, primarily immigration. We also visited Payne Oil and RegO Products, two companies growing our economy and serving Alamance County.
One of the biggest highlights of the week was presenting a Purple Heart Award and Bronze Star to Donna Gurtner, the daughter of WWII veteran Sidney Hawkins. Though Sidney was never able to receive the awards he earned – nor did he ever seek the recognition – we were privileged to ensure his family had this lasting reminder of his sacrifice and service.

Profile in USA Today: ""A GOP Leader Looks to Recast His Party's Image with Black Voters""
Our office was honored to be featured in a USA Today article this week focusing on our outreach efforts and determination to expand the conservative message of opportunity and individual liberty to new communities. The story reads:
""Walker, an affable former pastor, represents a North Carolina district that is one-fifth African-American. He is championing criminal justice reform and adequate funding for historically black colleges and universities, issues that are high priorities for many African-American voters.  ""Walker spokesman Jack Minor said the lawmaker is working on legislation that would allow student athletes – many of whom are black – to be compensated for their publicity rights. Walker also has hosted two Washington summits with HBCU leaders, meetings that helped pave the way for year-round Pell grants for HBCU students. He teamed up with North Carolina Democratic Rep. Alma Adams to establish an internship program for students from HBCUs. Walker also was the first Republican in years to give a keynote address at the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus Foundation dinner in June. All of the group's members are Democrats. ...  'Walker took the findings to heart during his first run for Congress in 2014, when he sought the support of local Democratic leader the Rev. Odell Cleveland. It took three meetings for Walker to win over the pastor, including a chat in Cleveland's office, coffee together at McDonald's and a small group lunch they attended together.  ... ""For her part, Anita Estell head of CELIE, a nonprofit focused on civic engagement, said she didn’t think the focus on Trump should prevent people from listening to Walker. Estell said she’d be happy to engage with Walker on diversity.  ""'I come from an era where Democrats and Republicans worked together,' Estell said. “If Mark Walker is trying to be a public servant for all of the residents of North Carolina, God bless him.'""

Wishing Our Next Generation of Leaders the Best As They Head Back to School
It was a special moment dropping my daughter, Anna Claire, off for her first day of 7th grade this week. As all of our students – grade school and college – teachers and administrators head back to school, I wish them all the best. 
We were thrilled to join Rick Morton and the Heads Up For Our Youth Team for their Back to School Rally at the Greensboro Coliseum. Their work is making a real difference in our community, helping support and prepare our students. Check out the highlights above as the Greensboro Police Department played in a basketball game against the Heads Up For Our Youth team and we raised resources for our students.

Fox Business: ""Millions drop off food stamps""
More than 2.8 million people have moved off of food stamps since February 2017. That is the ultimate measure of our success in delivering opportunity and working to rebuild the American Dream.
This is about hope, not judgement. Studies show welfare recipients who returned to work more than doubled their incomes and their time on welfare was cut in half. By promoting the dignity of work and using welfare funds to invest in job-training for work-capable adults, we can bring hope and opportunity to families who have not seen it for generations.
Currently, there are 769,300 able-bodied adults in North Carolina on SNAP. Studies find that 61 percent of those recipients are not working. These reforms would give 484,000 North Carolinians access to work or free job-training to close the skills gap and find work in one of the 6.7 million job openings across the country.

Water Safety Business Visit 
￼ 
Over the last decade, concerns about exposure to toxic perfluorinated chemicals (PFOS/PFOA) from contaminated municipal and/or private well water have become a significant issue in our community. As part of my district small business visits, I stopped by Altair Equipment, who is doing excellent work in water purification. Thanks so much to the Altair employees for our water safety discussion.
To learn more about my work to keep our water safe, click HERE.  
  

Upper Bucks Economic Talk
￼    
I delivered a legislative update to the Upper Bucks County Chamber of Commerce on the economy and answered their questions. Our nation faces many challenges, but perhaps none is more pressing than that of growing our economy. Today’s economic indicators are pointing the right direction - and not a moment too soon. When our local small businesses succeed, they create opportunity, invigorate communities and preserve the distinct character of our local economy.

Farm Tour:
Thank you to all the producers who hosted me this week in northeast Kansas on my final annual farm tour, and to everyone over the years who has given me the opportunity to hear the many thoughts and concerns of farm country during my time in Congress. Visiting the small towns and rural homes of eastern Kansans has been critical to my mission to best serve the Second District. The many voices of rural America must continue to be heard and advanced throughout the halls of Congress and within our federal government.

Albers Farm:
It was a pleasure to start the day visiting with Mark and Crystal Albers on their farm near Denton. We had a great conversation about the impact of tariffs and trade retaliation on farmers’ bottom lines as well as the importance of keeping access to foreign markets open for soybean and other crop producers.Thanks also to Crystal for demonstrating her work in ag communications that is made practical through access to high-speed rural internet. Thanks for having me!

Thank you to Fred and Pam Meng and family for taking time out of their busy morning to show me their dairy operation just outside Troy. As operators of a Kansas dairy business, the Mengs’ perspective on the lack of and continued necessity for affordable health insurance was invaluable as I continue working toward solutions for rural healthcare.I appreciated visiting again!
￼
 
Hiawatha Ag Partners:
I also appreciated continuing the discussion at Ag Partners Coop in Hiawatha. Our packed roundtable with Ag Partners staff reiterated the current state of rural healthcare and rising premiums, anxiety in international trade, and the continued need to lessen detrimental federal regulations.
￼
 
Muscotah Mercantile:
Thanks so much to the community of Muscotah and the Muscotah Mercantile for demonstrating that local farmers and rural Kansans can pool together and provide a real treasure in small town America—a local café! I enjoyed gathering with everyone who came out to the Mercantile to chat with me and catch up!
￼
 
Armstrong Farm:
My last stop of the day was Jay Armstrong’s wheat farm in rural Atchison County. Here we discussed market volatility as well as the importance of agricultural research in our communities. Research is a critical component that allows American producers to feed the world. Thanks for the terrific visit!
￼
 
Upcoming Jobs Fair Details:
Mark your calendars for my 9th annual Jobs Fair!
I will be hosting this year’s Jobs Fair on Friday, September 21 from 10:00am-12:30pm at the Kansas Expo Center Hall. For additional details and to register, please visit my website here. I look forward to seeing you there!

8/26/18 17:01,my bill to protect Washington commuters from unfair tolls,"District Update | August 26, 2018
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email
￼
Defending Southwest Washington against a commuter fee on working-class families
I introduced legislation last week prohibiting any tolls at the Washington-Oregon state line without agreement from both states’ governors. Until Oregon formally scraps their plan to toll I-5 and I-205 at the state line without providing a specific plan to benefit those who will pay, Washington commuters deserve to have a safeguard written into law that will protect them.  My bill, the I-5 Corridor Cooperation Act, comes after multiple high-ranking Washington officials, including Governor Jay Inslee, have joined me in taking public stances opposed to Oregon’s Concept C to toll all lanes of I-5 and I-205 at the state line. Despite this public opposition, Oregon Transportation Commission took additional steps toward the implementation of Concept C at its meeting on August 16.  The I-5 Corridor Cooperation Act requires a signed agreement by the governors of Oregon and Washington before any tolls can be collected on federal roads I-5 or I-205 between S.R. 500 and U.S. 30. It also requires that the Federal Highways Administration issue a formal economic impact study covering tolling impacts on Clark and Cowlitz County businesses, residents and tribes before any such agreement can be reached.  Oregon and Washington should work together on mutually-beneficial, transportation solutions for I-5 and I-205. Oregon’s current plan to disproportionately target Southwest Washington’s working class with tolls while providing no benefits and making it harder to fix our bridges is the opposite.   You can read more about this legislation here.  
Plan to remove sea lions, save endangered salmon gains traction 
￼
My bipartisan bill, Endangered Salmon & Fisheries Predation Prevention Act, passed the U.S. House in June. Now, a companion bill is moving forward in the U.S. Senate and I am hopeful they will vote on it soon so we can get this sent to the president's desk to become law.

Support for my bipartisan bill to remove most predatory sea lions grows
Having the support of so many individuals, organizations, researchers, fishing businesses and tribes has been critical to the momentum behind my bill to control the sea lions ravaging our salmon populations. The chair of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission recently wrote about the importance of my bill for tribal members.

I'm encouraged to have secured the support of every single Democrat and Republican congressional representative in Washington state for my bipartisan bill to save our salmon runs. Now, we need to get it across the finish line. This Washington paper recently wrote an editorial praising the bipartisan effort in the House and calling for quick action in the Senate.

From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:
Good Afternoon,
As the Little League World Series comes to a close, Williamsport gears up for Sunday’s championship game.
￼
Little League World Series Championship in Sight 
For the past week, all eyes have been on Williamsport’s ballparks as fans from across the world cheer on their home teams. From stunning victories to close defeats, this tournament has been one for the books. Each year, it’s a pleasure to host this special event for a global audience. As I watch the remaining teams play, I’m inspired by the level of dedication and work ethic shown by each player. Tune in this Sunday at 3 PM for the championship game. Good luck to the remaining teams and I hope all who visited Williamsport had a memorable experience!  
Important Notice for Constituents Affected by Flooding
Due to the recent flooding throughout the district, it has come to my attention that there may be fraudulent activity occurring by individuals going door to door and identifying themselves as FEMA representatives in Bradford County. FEMA has confirmed they have not dispatched representatives to the area. If you have been contacted by one of these individuals and believe it to be fraudulent, please follow the instructions below to report.

Facts About the “Quiet Skies” Program
In an effort to correct inaccurate information reported by various media outlets regarding “Quiet Skies”, The Transportation Security Administration released a statement explaining the program’s purpose and scope. “Quiet Skies” is a vital tool that allows Federal Air Marshalls to efficiently allocate resources to monitor international travelers who may require enhanced screening. Contrary to reporting, this program does not account for factors such as race or religion. Federal Air Marshalls have a difficult and important job and it is essential they have the tools to detect, deter, and defeat any potential threat.

ABOUT BRADLEY | HOW CAN I HELP | CONTACT BRADLEY | WANT TO RECEIVE MY UPDATES?
￼

Dear Lindsey, 
Last week, I held five town hall meetings as we concluded our ""Better Off Now"" Town Hall Meeting Tour. We had stops in Grand Bay, Monroeville, Seminole, Loxley, and Spanish Fort. I really appreciate all those who came out to share their ideas and opinions with me. Even though we may not always agree on every issue, hearing directly from the people I represent makes me a better Congressman. 
￼ 
If you weren't able to make it out to one of the town hall meetings, here is a quick overview of some of the most popular topics. 
	•	Veterans issues: Issues with the VA remain one of the top things I hear about at my town hall meetings. We must keep the pressure up to get better care for all our veterans and work to get their cases handled as quickly as possible. We have made some progress, but not enough. If you are a veteran who is having trouble with the VA, please contact my Mobile office at 251-690-2811.
	•	Immigration: Alabamians are very concerned about illegal immigration, as they should be. We must get serious about actually securing our border and cracking down on sanctuary cities. We must also build the border wall. The recent murder of Mollie Tibbetts in Iowa by an illegal immigrant just underscores why this issue must be a top priority.
	•	Infrastructure: From the I-10 Bridge to Highway 98 to Highway 45, we have a lot of important road projects throughout Southwest Alabama, and I hear about these projects at my town hall meetings. While these projects are actually handled at the state level, the federal government does provide a portion of the funding. In order to get these projects completed, we need a long-term, reliable funding solution for our nation's road projects. 
	•	Deep State/Government Reform: Understandably, a lot of people are worried about the ""Deep State"" and the flaws in our government. The government bureaucracy is too big, and there are too many unelected government bureaucrats who are worried about advancing their own agendas instead of solving the problems facing the American people. We see this in the Mueller investigation, which has gone on for far too long and has gotten us no closer to proving any sort of ""collusion."" We need to take power away from unelected bureaucrats and instead empower the American people.
	•	Health care: Many local residents are still concerned about the future of health care. This includes the need to repeal Obamacare, as well as concerns about the future of Alabama's rural hospitals. I remain strongly committed to fixing our broken health care system and saving our rural hospitals.
These are just a few of the highlights from my twelve town hall meetings over the last month. Every town hall meeting is different, and I look forward to holding more of these public meetings over the coming weeks and months. 
Other Highlights 
I also wanted to highlight a few of the other meetings and events from the past week in Southwest Alabama. 
￼ 
On Tuesday, I traveled to Monroeville for a full day of meetings and events. In addition to my town hall meeting in the old Monroe County Courthouse, I visited Sterling Packages, Green Products, the Monroeville Kiwanis Club, the Monroeville VA Clinic, and the Monroe County Chamber of Commerce. It was a busy but productive day in Monroe County! 
I also held my annual meeting with our college and university presidents. This year's meeting was on the Fairhope campus of Coastal Alabama Community College. I always appreciate the opportunity to get the group together to discuss issues important to higher education. These institutions of higher education are very important to the economic success of our region. 
￼ 
One of the most interesting things I do during a District Work Period is visit local businesses. It helps to see firsthand how our local businesses operate and to learn more about how policies in Washington are actually impacting businesses and workers. This past week, I visited LaFargeHolcim in Theodore, Arkema in Axis, and the Huntsman Corportation in McIntosh. All three were very informative visits. 
If you would like for me to visit your business or speak to your organization, please contact my office. I always appreciate the opportunity to spend time traveling across the First District.

Last year, I had the opportunity to visit the “Hanoi Hilton” in Vietnam with Senator John McCain, where he was held as a prisoner of war. It was a remarkable experience that I will never forget. May his service to our country never be forgotten. His family, friends, and colleagues will be in our prayers.
What's Ahead 
This week marks the final week in the August District Work Period, and I will again be spending time getting around Alabama to listen to the people I represent. I'm also looking forward to the start of the college football season this weekend!

Honoring Tech. Sgt. John Chapman
I was humbled to attend the Medal of Honor ceremony at the White House for Tech. Sgt. John Chapman, who gave his life in 2002 while serving our country in Afghanistan. Knowing that al-Qaeda fighters were closing in, Tech. Sgt. Chapman and his fellow Navy SEALs returned to a militant stronghold to rescue a teammate who had fallen from a battle-damaged helicopter. During this effort, Tech. Sgt. John Chapman gave his own life and saved the lives of his team members by engaging an al-Qaeda machine gun team firing from an enemy bunker.
He is the first airman to receive the Medal of Honor for actions conducted since the Vietnam War.
Each of us owes a debt of gratitude to veterans who bravely fought in defense of our country and its values. It is a debt we can never repay, but this honor is a small way we can pay tribute to Tech. Sgt. Chapman.
￼
￼
Continuing Concerns about Tariffs
This week, I sent a letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, reiterating my concerns about the economic harms caused by the Administration's choice to impose tariffs under the false pretext of national security.
The decision to impose these taxes has significantly diminished the ability of domestic manufacturers to provide affordable finished products to American consumers. Combined with the impact of retaliatory tariffs on unrelated industries, imposing such massive costs on U.S. consumers and manufacturers threatens job losses in downstream industries.
In addition, I remain concerned that the exclusion process developed by the Commerce Department is inefficient and unnecessarily burdensome, resulting in the delay of timely determinations for Pennsylvania companies seeking relief.  
As the Administration continues to focus on deregulation and other pro-growth policies, it is vital that it remove counterproductive taxes on imported steel and aluminum so that U.S. manufacturers and producers can compete with foreign companies and provide well-paying jobs for American families.
￼
￼
Good News for Westmoreland County's Firefighters
Volunteer firefighters and first responders embody public service in their dedicated work to ensure the safety of others. This week, the Department of Homeland Security awarded an Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) to the Collinsburg Volunteer Fire Company in Westmoreland County.
The awarded funds will be used to purchase a new commercial, two-door tanker. I am confident that these funds will aid in efforts to protect firefighters while also enhancing the overall capabilities of the department.
If you belong to a fire department or emergency response organization and would like more information on Assistance to Firefighters Grants, please contact my Pittsburgh office at (412) 803-3501. I am proud to support these brave men and women across Pennsylvania.

U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
Last week, the White House nominated Eric Gartner to serve as U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Gartner is a retired United States Air Force Colonel who served for over 24 years as a Special Agent in the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI). Since 2014, Mr. Gartner has worked as a law enforcement, counterintelligence, and governance subject matter expert with Noblis. In addition, Mr. Gartner serves on the Board of The Veterans Group, a non-profit helping homeless veterans in Philadelphia.
Between his military and private sector experience, it is clear that Mr. Gartner is dedicated to making our communities a safer place to live, work, and raise a family.
I am pleased that President Trump nominated Mr. Gartner to serve as a U.S. Marshal and look forward to seeing the Senate confirm him for this position.
The Eastern District of Pennsylvania comprises the counties of Berks, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster, Lehigh, Montgomery, Northampton and Philadelphia.

NEWS FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT
Dear Friend,  Yesterday, we lost a true American hero and patriot – Senator John McCain. Whether flying off pitching carrier decks or surviving years of torture as a POW in Vietnam - he was as tough as they come. Semper Fortis! Leah and I send Senator McCain’s family and friends our prayers.  We had a great week traveling throughout the eastern counties in the Second District meeting with farmers, law enforcement, veterans, and students. Please read about my week below: 
 ￼  On Monday and Tuesday, I spent the day meeting farmers throughout Suwannee County and Columbia County and learning about their agricultural endeavors. I heard about best management practices and water conservation measures these local farmers are taking.  ￼  From visiting a beef and sausage processing facility to speaking to the Columbia Livestock Market Auction crowd, we met folks from all across Columbia County and Suwannee County. Thank you to Steven Dicks for putting together a very informative and fun day.   ￼  On Tuesday, I visited two hospitals in Lake City and heard from health professionals about the issues they are facing with the federal government, as well as how they are working to grow and expand.  ￼  We then had a great lunch with the Lake City Kiwanis Club, where I was able to give an update on the work I am doing in Washington and answer questions. Thank you to Charles Peeler for inviting me.  ￼  In the afternoon, we met with Jeffrey Askew, the Director of Marion County Veterans Services.  Thank you to Mr. Askew for gathering local veterans so that we could discuss the important issues they are facing, including bureaucracy at the VA and my veterans opioid and transplant bills. We also visited the Ocala-Marion County Veterans Memorial Park and saw the Statue of Liberty.   ￼   On Wednesday, we spent the morning at Dunnellon High School. I heard from the Air Force JROTC students about their rigorous program that focuses on helping the local community and setting students up for success. The Dunnellon HS JROTC program has 130 cadets who are led by Lt. Col. Dwayne Gray and MSgt. Kevin Gunter.   ￼  It was great to see Principal Wade Martin, Superintendent Dr. Heidi Maier, former Dunnellon Mayor Walter Green, and District 2 Chair of the Marion County School Board Beth McCall.  ￼   We then enjoyed a fantastic lunch cooked and presented by the Dunnellon HS Culinary students, led by Chef Melissa Mosby. Chef Mosby has done an outstanding job molding these students into top tier chefs. During lunch, I heard from students about school safety and mental health, and answered their questions about what we can do to improve these areas of concern. This year, the House passed legislation to improve school safety and dedicate more funding to mental health, including the STOP School Violence Act. This legislation creates a grant program to train students, teachers, school officials, and law enforcement on how to identify and prevent future acts of violence. By empowering students and educators and working with law enforcement we can prevent future tragedies from occurring.   ￼   We held our 5th Opioid Listening Session at the Dunnellon Police Department this week. Folks across the Second District are fighting the good fight against the opioid epidemic, but each community approaches this crisis in different ways. We heard from law enforcement, local leaders, concerned citizens, faith based organizations, and rehabilitation professionals in Dunnellon.   ￼   It’s great to see the local community working with law enforcement to fight the devastation of opioids with an amnesty program, mentorships, detox programs, and informing the community. Together we can make a difference.  ￼   Next, we traveled north to tour the Chiefland City Hall in Levy County and then spent the afternoon in Dixie County. There, we toured the McGriff Channel Dredging Project. We saw how non-maintenance of the McGriff Channel has negatively affected the environmental and economic viability of the Town of Suwannee and Dixie County. Thank you to Carol West at the Suwannee River Chamber for the invitation to join State Rep. Chuck Clemons and several others to discuss this project.  ￼   I was honored to stop by the Gilchrist County Sheriff’s Office and speak with Sheriff Bobby Schultz. The Gilchrist County Sheriff's Office experienced unimaginable tragedy earlier this year when they lost two of their own. Gilchrist County Sergeant Noel Ramirez and Deputy Sheriff Taylor Lindsey were tragically murdered in the line of duty during an ambush shooting on April 19th.  ￼  Investigator Holder then took me on a ride-along to get firsthand experience of what our law enforcement officers do on a daily basis to ensure our safety. Thank you to all who serve on the thin blue line. 
Thank you for your continued energy and enthusiasm, as reflected in your letters and Facebook posts. If you haven’t already, LIKE my Facebook page. You can also follow me on Twitter @DrNealDunnFL2. 
Thank you for the opportunity to serve you in Congress!
 Sincerely,  ￼  Dr. Neal Dunn Member of Congress

  Constituent Casework Corner  When sending a birthday care package overseas to their deployed family member, the wrong FPO was used and caused the package to be returned.  After communicating with the U.S. Postal Service, the family was informed the package was being held at an airport with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.  Unable to have the package released on their own, the family contacted my office for assistance.  My office was able to work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to have the package returned to the family so it could be reshipped to the deployed service member.       Do you need help with a federal agency?

Dear Friend,  
For the last several days, I have been on a Congressional Delegation visit to Iraq, Jordan, and Turkey. During this visit, myself and Rep. Jimmy Panetta (D-CA-20) had the opportunity to meet with troops, visit a United Nations Refugee Center, and discussed Pastor Andrew Brunson with Turkish officials. 
As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I take very seriously the charge to meet with our men and women in uniform both here at home and in theater to see how we can best provide for them and ensure they are able to complete their missions safely and effectively.
Below are a few snapshots from the visit.

Congressman McHenry Weekly Update 


America's Economy is Booming



This week marked the longest bull market ever. This is just another example of the positive indicators that we are continuing to see in our economy. In the past year alone, we've seen many benefits from Republican tax reform in the Tenth District and all across the country. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act didn't just lower taxes, it's helped hardworking Americans save in other ways as well. For instance, electricity bills are down in forty-eight states, including North Carolina, thanks to tax reform. Unemployment continues to be the lowest we've seen in decades and consumers and business owners are more positive about the future than they've been in a long time. Click here or on the image below to learn more about why our economy is better off now.

Keeping Our Communities Safe



In last week's newsletter, I shared some of what the House of Representatives has done to help protect communities by passing bills to combat the opioid epidemic. The House has also passed other important pieces of legislation that will help ensure our communities and schools are safer. The STOP School Violence Act makes our schools safer by providing resources to train students, teachers, and local law enforcement so they can help stop school violence before it happens. Click here to learn more about this important legislation. You can also learn about other community building legislation the House has passed by clicking here or on the image below.

What I Have Been Reading



ESPN Films documentary features five Montreat lacrosse athletes

Montreat College 

ESPN recently premiered ‘Crossroads,’ an inspiring documentary on five Montreat College lacrosse players. It is great to see a Tenth District college being highlighted in an ESPN documentary but it is even more exciting to learn the story behind the young men who, against all odds, fulfilled their dream to play college lacrosse. 


Sen. John McCain, American 'maverick' and political giant, dies at 81
 
USA Today

My thoughts are with Senator John McCain and his family. He was a Vietnam War hero, a United States Senator, and a true patriot who served our nation for decades. Giulia and I have his family, friends, and staff in our prayers as they mourn his passing.

Friends,
 
As students head back to school, it is important to remember all of the people who make our communities safe and who support students. That’s our teachers, our law enforcement officers, first responders, and many more. We must remember to show our appreciation for these public servants. I am committed to doing my part to improve our communities and keep students safe. As your voice in Congress, I’ve worked hard to advance bipartisan policies that combat the opioid crisis, end human trafficking, target dangerous criminals, and make our schools safer.
 
In June, the House passed H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act. This comprehensive package of bipartisan bills is a product of months of work to find solutions that will advance opioid treatment and recovery initiatives, improve prevention, protect our communities, and bolster our efforts to fight deadly synthetic drugs like fentanyl. This is an issue especially close to home – North Carolina has four of the top 25 worst cities for opioid abuse in the country – including Fayetteville in our district.
 
While H.R. 6 sits in the Senate, families are continuing to be affected by this epidemic. It was recently reported that North Carolina saw the second highest increase in opioid deaths across the nation in 2017. This is simply unacceptable. It’s time for the Senate to pass H.R. 6 and get our communities the support we so desperately need.
 
In addition to our work to combat the opioid crisis, Congress has taken critical action to end the scourge of human trafficking and protect young people. The House has passed dozens of bills to fight human trafficking, and President Donald Trump signed into law the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), a bill I was proud to support. This important legislation allows prosecutors to criminally charge operators of websites that allow human trafficking content and ensures they are shut down. This is a critical deterrent and as a result, online advertising for commercial sex trafficking has gone down by 60-80%. 
 
Working with President Trump, we’ve also made it a priority to strengthen our border security, better enforce immigration laws, and target dangerous gangs like MS-13. One example is the Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act, a law to foster and improve existing partnerships to create safer neighborhoods through sustained reductions in violent crimes.
 
And last, but not least, we’ve made progress to improve school safety and address mental health challenges with critical legislation and $2 billion in additional resources, including the STOP School Violence Act. This law helps to make our schools safer by providing resources to train students, teachers, and local law enforcement so they can help stop school violence before it happens. It also encourages state and local officials to share best practices for preventing school violence with federal law enforcement and their counterparts in other states.
 
In addition, it provides funding for technology and equipment to improve school security and stop attacks. This funding may be used for metal detectors, locks, lighting, and other technologies to keep schools safe. We have also passed legislation to improve compliance with the federal background check system. This is a good start, but there is more to do.
 
All in all, we’ve made good progress to keep America’s communities – and America’s children – safe. Rest assured as Congress heads back into session in a few weeks, I will keep fighting for what matters to you.
 
 
Until next week,
￼

Member of Congress (NC-08)

Making Communities Safe Again
 

Our nation faces threats daily - both at home and abroad.  As Vice-Chair of the Subcommittee on Homeland Security, I take the responsibility of protecting our American citizens right here in our own communities very serious. 
This week we all watched in despair as officials announced that Mollie Tibbetts a 20-year-old young woman from Iowa, was murdered by an illegal immigrant while going out for a run. A young girl was robbed of her future by a criminal who was in this country illegally.   Similarly, you may recall Kate Steinle, the 32-year-old woman that was murdered by an illegal alien in a sanctuary city.  These murders of innocent, Americans are the result of a flawed system that protects illegals over its own citizens.  This is why we must secure our borders and put the safety of our citizens first!  Democrats continue to put the lives of people who have entered this country illegally before our own citizens at the cost of American lives.   We cannot allow loose policies to stand, and political games to dictate the level of safety in our country. Which is why I will continue working with President Trump to secure more funding for the border wall, mandate e-verify, shut down sanctuary cities, and end chain migration.   Border security is national security.  We need to stop incentivizing illegal immigration by rewarding aliens with jobs and safe havens, and focus on protecting the safety of law-abiding American citizens. 
Spring internships I am now accepting internship applications for the spring of 2019 for my D.C. and district offices located in Biloxi and Hattiesburg. Internships in my office are for college-aged students that want to experience the legislative process firsthand and assist with various office responsibilities. Interns will have unique opportunities to attend events and hearings in D.C. and in south Mississippi. The deadline to apply for a spring internship is October 25, 2018. Head over to my website to download the application. 

In your service,
￼

Dillon Inland Port Day
 
 
We partnered with the South Carolina Ports Authority to give over 80 educators, religious leaders, and business leaders a tour of the Dillon Inland Port. We wanted to show these influential leaders that what they've heard about the port isn't just talk- the port is effecting real change in our community! It has already generated 1,000 jobs, and this is just the beginning of the opportunities the port will create in our region. Now, our goal is to connect people on the sidelines of the economy with these new opportunities and give them hope for a brighter future. We brought everyone together to discuss how we can maximize the benefits of the port so that we can uplift our entire community. This is truly a generation changing opportunity, and it is up to us to take it!

Rebuilding Together
 
 
This week, I visited three houses that are currently under construction after being damaged in Hurricane Matthew and I received updates from the South Carolina Disaster Recovery Office about the rebuilding process. In addition to the homes I visit while I'm in the district, members of my staff regularly visit houses under construction to ensure residents are able to get back into their homes as quickly as possible. The recovery process is long, but we will be there every step of the way!

Canfor Southern Pine Tour 
 
 
I had the opportunity to tour Canfor Southern Pine in Conway to learn more about their operation and efforts to adopt new technologies and expand their business. Canfor employs hundreds of people at their three plants in the Seventh District and they are constantly investing in modern equipment and advanced technologies to keep their operations as efficient and productive as possible. Our pro-growth policies are ensuring Canfor can continue to make these important investments at their facilities in the Seventh District and across the entire state.

Aviation Week 
 
 
Growing up around the old Myrtle Beach Airforce Base, aviation has always played a large role in my life. It was an honor to participate in the National Aviation Week press conference to highlight the tremendous value Seventh District airports add to our economy and  community. We have multiple commercial and general aviation airports in the Seventh District that play a vital role in attracting new employers and stimulating our economy. It is absolutely critical that we invest in airport infrastructure so that they remain vibrant for years to come!

Encompass Health Ribbon Cutting  
 
 
It was great to join Encompass Health for the unveiling of their new REAL (Realistic Environment Applied Learning) Therapy Space on Thursday. The REAL Therapy Space is a mock shopping center where nutritionists and doctors will teach patients how to make healthy decisions once they are discharged from hospital care, something that many patients struggle with. This is an exciting addition to Encompass Health's state of the art facility, and I was honored to join the celebration!

Dear Friends, 

One of the best parts of my job is talking to and hearing from neighbors, job creators, and friends in central Arkansas. This week was a busy one – from visiting with entrepreneurs, meeting with STEM advocates, sitting down with Faulkner County representatives on the Highway 89 project, and much more. I wanted to share some highlights from the week with you. 

Encouraging Entrepreneurship 
￼
I started Monday off visiting the University of Central Arkansas's (UCA) Makerspace, Powered by the Conductor. I'm inspired by the partnership between UCA and the Conductor to establish Makerspace as a tool to work with middle school and high school students to entrepreneurship.

I toured their space and received hands-on experience making ""squishy circuits"" with Master Maker Jason Huselton (top right) and CEO of the Conductor, Kim Lane (top left). Jason showed me how they use 3D printers to make prototypes and other products, and I enjoyed having the opportunity to see their good work firsthand.

It’s exciting to see this type of entrepreneurial growth in central Arkansas, and I’m proud to support organizations like the Conductor that support access to capital and mentorship for business owners and innovators, which are vital to the success of growing ""homegrown"" small businesses.

Inspiring Young Women to Pursue STEM 
￼
Thank you Dawn Prasifka (left), Cristy Sowell (middle right), Katie Dailey (right), with the Girl Scouts - Diamonds of Arkansas, for the good work you are doing to train and inspire young women to pursue Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) related fields.
I’m impressed by your efforts to revamp the Reading Initiative for Student Excellence (RISE) program, which helps give hope and purpose to young girls in risk of juvenile detention, and I am excited to learn about your state-of-the-art Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) Center being built in Fort Smith, Arkansas that will be open to girl scouts across our state, focusing on STEM learning and the arts.   Thank you for coming to my Little Rock office to share these updates with me. 
Equipping Our Arkansas Firefighters  
￼
I shared the good news with Mayor Paul Wellenberger of Fairfield Bay on Wednesday morning, congratulating the Fairfield Bay Fire Department on receiving $328,222 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) through the Assistance to Firefighter Grant program (AFG).
Our first responders put their lives on the line to protect the lives and property of their neighbors and it is imperative that they have the staffing and equipment necessary to get the job done. Arkansas has received over $6 million through FEMA grant programs since 2015. It has been my privileged to provide over 25 support letters to cities like Fairfield Bay.
In April, I testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security in support of funding for the AFG program and to make sure that our fire departments have the funding they need. I have also written to the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security every year since coming to Congress telling them why funding the AFG program is so important to the safety of Arkansans.
Interning in Central Arkansas or Washington, D.C.
￼
We have had incredibly talented young men and women intern on my team in central Arkansas and Washington, D.C. since I have been elected to serve you. 

Last summer, we had (top left | left to right) Madeline Colclasure, Brett Dush, Jack Carter, and Neatric Norwood - all from central Arkansas - help us in my Washington, D.C. office. Now, Neatric is working and leading on my team! This summer's D.C. interns included (bottom left | left to right) John Scruggs, Sam Ferguson, Parker Temple, and Lydia Booth. Our two interns from Little Rock working in our central Arkansas offices is (right | left to right) Anna Reckling and Lauren Ator. We appreciate all their hard work! 

If you are a college student or recent graduate, or know someone who is, we are looking for applicants to intern in my D.C., Little Rock, and Conway offices for this fall semester.
If you are interested in applying, please send your resume and cover letter to ar02.applications@mail.house.gov.
Working on the Highway 89 Overpass Project
￼
The Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department (Arkansas DOT) hosted a good meeting with Judge Baker from Faulkner County, Mayor Holland from Mayflower, and Metroplan, along with representatives from Faulkner County and the Arkansas Department of Transportation, discussing details on the Highway 89 overpass project. 
Highway 89 overpass will be an asset to the city of Mayflower and the surrounding area within Faulkner County. After completion, Highway 89 will establish a corridor to better assist with the traffic flow, help first responders better respond to emergencies at locations that are currently difficult to get to, and help boosts central Arkansas's economy. 
Thank you for taking time to keep up with the work I'm doing on your behalf. If I can be any assistance to you or your family, please reach out to my office at (501) 324-5941 or go to my website at hill.house.gov.
Sincerely,
￼ 
Representative French Hill

8/26/18 13:54,Latest from Lamar: Urging the Senate to end its bad habit of treating presidential nominees as innocent until nominated,"

Republican Congress Getting Results for Tennesseans:
	•	This week I voted for – and the Senate passed – legislation that funds grants to help Tennessee communities fight the opioid crisis, research at the National Institutes of Health to develop a non-addictive painkiller, and increases the maximum Pell grant to help more Tennesseans attend college.
	•	The legislation also provides $675 billion for our nation’s military.
Important news from this past week:
	•	The Trump Administration and our Republican Congress are delivering results for the American people – including helping to create a stronger economy. This week marked the longest stretch of growth ever for the stock market. This is just the latest economic success. Since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law in December, more than 1.5 million jobs have been created, wages are increasing at the fastest rate since 2009, and business investment is up an average of 9.4 percent this year.
 
Urging the Senate to end its bad habit of treating presidential nominees as “innocent until nominated”
￼
This week I spoke on the Senate floor about Judge Kavanagh. You can watch my remarks here.
 
The Senate has developed a bad habit, and that bad habit is treating presidential nominees as “innocent until nominated.” I hope to see better behavior during the next few weeks as the Senate begins hearings on President Trump’s nomination of Judge Kavanaugh to be a member of the United States Supreme Court. In 2006, I voted for Judge Kavanaugh when he was President George W. Bush’s nominee for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Colombia Circuit. Last month, I attended President Trump’s nomination of Judge Kavanaugh at the White House. I was impressed again with Judge Kavanaugh when he visited me in my office a few weeks ago. We discussed the importance of states’ rights, how to strengthen the Supreme Court as an institution, and other matters — but never once did I ask him how he might vote on a particular case.
During my eight years as governor of Tennessee, I appointed about 50 judges. In doing so, I did not ask one applicant to be a Tennessee judge of that entire 50, how he or she would rule on abortion or immigration or taxation. Instead of treating Judge Kavanaugh as someone recently released from San Quentin State Prison, I hope we treat him with dignity and respect so that Americans can better understand his temperament, his intelligence, and his character. That’s what we should want to know about a presidential nominee for the Supreme Court. Read more in my op-ed in the Chattanooga Times Free Press.
 
Passing the largest pay raise for military service members in nearly a decade, including for our troops at Ft. Campbell, Millington
This week, the Senate passed a bill that provides $675 billion for our nation’s military to help ensure our service members are a top priority and receive the support and resources they need. The bill provides the largest pay raise in nearly 10 years for the men and women who serve in our military – including those serving at Fort Campbell and Naval Support Activity Mid-South in Millington, Tennessee. The bill includes the largest Department of Defense research and development budget in history – a measure that will give the United States an advantage over our adversaries and allow us to maintain the strongest military in the world. This bill also includes $900 million to ensure the men and women serving in our National Guard have the resources they need to keep us safe during catastrophes, and increased funding for hypersonic research conducted by The University of Tennessee.

It was great to see Dunlap Mayor Dwain Land yesterday. He told me about the great work he’s doing in the City of Dunlap.
 
 
 
Providing funding to fight the opioid epidemic, to improve our nation’s schools, and to set record funding for biomedical research 
For the fourth straight year, the Senate has provided record funding in a regular appropriations bill for biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which allows us to have more access to life-changing treatments and cures, and see more medical miracles. Senate passage of this legislation is a step in the right direction for our country’s ongoing fight against the opioid crisis. This legislation provides $3.7 billion for programs aimed at putting an end to opioid abuse, including $500 million for NIH research to develop non-addictive pain medicines, and $1.5 billion for State Opioid Response Grants, originally authorized by the 21st Century Cures Act. These grants will fund prevention activities, training for health care practitioners, and increase access to medication-assisted treatment in states like Tennessee. The bill also provides $445 million for our nation’s charter schools -- which give teachers more freedom and parents more choices, and give students a real opportunity to attend a good school that’s right for them -- and a funding increase for each of the three largest K-12 education funding accounts that would allow states to provide better education to disadvantaged students, support academic enrichment and provide services for special education. The bill also raises the maximum Pell grant by $100 to $6,195 to help more students afford higher education.

It was great to have Evelyn Villarreal and her parents, Elena and Milan, at the National Institutes of Health oversight hearing this week. Evelyn was treated for spinal muscular atrophy type 1 with a new gene therapy developed by Nationwide Children’s Hospital, which receives funding from the National Institutes of Health.
 
 
Chairing the Senate health committee’s oversight hearing on the National Institutes of Health
The Senate health committee hearing I chaired this week was an opportunity to learn more about how federal dollars are being spent and ways to maintain America’s competitive advantage in basic research. In December 2016, Congress passed what Senate Majority Leader McConnell called the “most important legislation of the year,” the 21st Century Cures Act. We gave the National Institutes of Health $4.8 billion to conduct the research that we hope will lead to breathtaking new medicines, treatments, and cures. We often say it’s hard to think of a major scientific advancement since World War II that has not been supported by federal funding, but we are not the only country to have figured that out.  Other countries have seen that investing in basic research can lead to breathtaking new discoveries.  Since 2007, China has increased its spending on basic science by a factor of four and may surpass the United States in total spending on research and development this year. This is why this week’s oversight hearing was important in ensuring the United States keeps its advantage in biomedical research and continues to support National Institutes of Health breakthroughs.

August 26, 2018   Dear  @gmail.com,  I've written and spoke at length about the previous administration's War on Coal and the devastation it has brought to rural communities I represent. While low natural gas prices have played a major part in the declining use and demand for coal, overreaching federal rules and regulations have, as President Obama promised, made it nearly impossible to fully realize the benefits of one of our most abundant natural resources.  
Eight years of an anti-coal agenda took a human toll in my district in the form of lost jobs, lost benefits, and bankruptcies, which have threatened promised pension payments to retirees. ""Keep it in the ground"" policies led to a loss of revenue to local taxing districts, to counties, to villages, to first line responders and support for our schools. They dried up the ability for the local grocery store and the local hardware store to operate. Those years were devastating to southern Illinois.  
Thankfully, the previous administration's most aggressive anti-coal policy -- the so-called Clean Power Plan -- never fully took effect. The Supreme Court took the extraordinary and unprecedented step of halting its implementation. And for good reason. This rule was so burdensome, more than half the states, a bipartisan majority in Congress, and dozens of rural electric co-ops, trade associations and labor unions challenged its legality.  
That's why last week I was glad to see the Trump Administration propose a replacement: the Affordable Clean Energy rule. By returning to the principles of cooperative federalism that have successfully and impressively reduced air pollution for decades, rather than impose burdensome, top-down mandates on the states, the new rule seeks to empower states to continue reducing emissions in ways that best fit their various energy portfolios.
This state-led approach is better because every state's energy needs and resources are different. For example: some states have an abundance of coal and nuclear power (like Illinois), while others have greater opportunities to use hydropower (like Washington) or solar (like California and Nevada). You can learn more about the vastly different energy portfolios of each state here.  
As Chairman of the Environment Subcommittee, I know that environmental protection and economic prosperity are not mutually exclusive. We can have clean air, clean water, and a healthy environment for ourselves and our children without destroying jobs and raising energy costs. 
Sincerely, ￼  John Shimkus Member of Congress

Cindy and I offer our sincerest condolences to the McCain family on the passing of Senator John McCain, an American war hero. Arizona lost an iconic leader last night. 
Senator McCain served Arizona and his country for decades - first in the U.S. Navy and then in Congress. He endured the trials of war in Vietnam, suffering greatly as a prisoner of war. He turned his attention to public service, giving Arizona a champion for western issues and worked to preserve American military preparedness. 
My first encounter with John McCain was when he ran for the U.S. House for the first time, as an East Valley Conservative. In my encounters with Senator McCain through the years, he was always gracious and respectful to me and my opinions. When I won election to the U.S. House, Senator McCain invited me to his office to talk to me about Congress. He dismissed his staff and mine and we spent more than an hour talking about politics, family, and America. I will always remember that occasion with great fondness. 
Our prayers are with the McCain family today.

Friend:  
It's been a very productive constituent work session in Southern Illinois this month. This past week was highlighted by welcoming House Committee on Veterans' Affairs chairman Dr. Phil Roe (R-TN) to Southern Illinois for my two-day ""Veterans Listening Tour."" Crisscrossing the district and hearing from our heroes and the people who care for them first-hand was vitally important as we continue to work to reform the VA and improve access to quality care. I also had the pleasure of touring the Costello Lock & Dam and visiting a father and son-operated dairy farm in Red Bud. Here's some of what we accomplished this past week in the 12th district. 

St. Louis Regional VA Visit 
￼ 
Dr. Roe and I kicked off my two-day listening tour at the St. Louis Regional VA, hearing from leadership and employees overseeing operations. These employees are on the front lines making sure veterans in our area are receiving the care and benefits they have earned. It was great to hear from these folks working hard to improve the care of veterans. 

Jefferson Barracks Cemetery Visit 
￼ 
It was hard not to be overcome with emotion when we visited Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery in St. Louis. We must never forget those who paid the ultimate price in defense of our freedom. 

Jefferson Barracks VA Hospital 

￼
After paying our respects to America’s heroes, we had the the opportunity to visit the Jefferson Barracks VA hospital with U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner (R-MO) to see new technology that is being employed to help veterans. ReWalk-More Than Walking, a new technological advancement aimed at helping veterans with spinal cord injuries walk using a robotic exoskeleton. This technology is a sign of what is to come for easing veterans’ health issues by creation and innovation.

Public Veterans Forum 
￼ 
In wrapping up the districtwide tour, I was proud to have Chairman Roe join me for a free, public Veterans Forum at American Legion Post 2007 in Swansea. Hearing directly from these heroes helps us know what we need to do to serve their needs in Congress. Thanks for all who turned out, and for the great questions and perspectives that were shared.

Touring the Costello Lock & Dam 
￼ 
I had the opportunity to attend the Lower Kaskaskia stakeholders meeting and tour the Costello Lock and Dam during dewatering. Dewatering is extremely important for the Army Corps of Engineers to observe what maintenance needs to be done. As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I recognize the critical role that our waterways play in our transportation system.

Dairy Farm Visit  
￼ 
I had the pleasure of visiting the Father-Son Reinhardt dairy farm in Red Bud, IL last week. I was able to see up close how this father and son operation has created a fully-automated farm using new technology maximize output and increase efficiency of operations.

That’s an update on what I’ve been doing. I hope you have a great week ahead!                         
Mike

Tenney Advocates for Local Dairy Farmers at Open Forum with USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue 
On Thursday, I held two open dairy forums in the 22nd District with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue. Secretary Perdue and I began the morning at Trinity Valley Dairy Farm then traveled to Verona to Brabant Farms. During the open forum, Secretary Perdue and I took questions from over 100 local farmers, FFA members and community leaders.
Secretary Sonny Perdue‘s visit to New York’s 22nd District marks the first time in 20 years that a U.S. Secretary of Agriculture has visited the region. 
Our nations farmers are hurting, especially our famers in Upstate New York where the issue has reached a crisis level. Throughout the last year and a half, I've held roundtables across the district to gain a deeper understanding of their struggle, and I am grateful Secretary Sonny Perdue took time to listen to the plight of our farmers. The Secretary listened to real stories, answered questions and provided insight into how the USDA, under his direction, is enacting meaningful changes to turn the tide. Milk prices are dropping at an alarming rate while feed and energy costs are skyrocketing. The dairy industry is the backbone of Upstate New York’s economy and a vital part of our region’s heritage. I will continue to work alongside Secretary Perdue to support all of our dairy farmers and ensure their voice is heard in Washington.

Tenney Joins Cabinet Member Linda McMahon to Highlight the Positive Impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
On Monday, I held a roundtable discussion with Cabinet Member Linda McMahon, head of the U.S. Small Business Administration, to discuss the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the positive impact on small businesses across Upstate New York. 
Following the roundtable, Linda McMahon and I visited Lakeside Innovative Technologies, a local Small Business Administration (SBA) success story. An SBA-backed loan allowed U.S. Army Veteran, Robert Hulchanski to move Lakeside Innovative Technologies from a temporary space to a 6,500-square-foot facility. 
Small businesses employ nearly 50 percent of the private workforce in New York and are the backbone of our local economy. As a small business owner, it’s a distinct honor to host Administrator McMahon here in the Mohawk Valley to highlight the importance of providing meaningful tax relief to our small business community. During the roundtable, we had the opportunity to speak with local business owners who shared real stories about the many ways tax reform has enabled them to give back to their employees, their community or expand their business.

Hurricane Harvey, One Year Later 
It’s been nearly one year since Hurricane Harvey devastated our communities. In the months that have followed, Texans have shown that they are both strong and resilient. But as you know, there is still more work to be done. This is why I have worked with my colleagues in Congress to secure over $100 billion in disaster relief. I have also met with White House Budget officials on a regular basis and urged them to promptly release all of the money that we have appropriated for our ongoing efforts. This money needs to be put to good use – not trapped in the bureaucracy.

Meanwhile, my staff remains ready and available to answer any questions you may have as you continue to recover from the storm. To contact any of my District Offices, visit my website. 

I am honored to serve you, the constituents of the 36th District of Texas, as we rebuild together.  
 American Families Are Better Off Now
￼
  In 2016, House Republicans laid out a bold policy agenda called A Better Way to tackle some of the biggest challenges we face, including tax reform, the economy, and national security – and we have delivered. As part of this agenda, the Republican-led House and Senate passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Since President Trump signed this historic legislation our economy has been booming and millions of Americans have already reaped the benefits.

In the nine months since the tax cut bill was passed into law, more than 1.6 million jobs have been created, 90 percent of workers are receiving bigger paychecks, unemployment has hit historic lows, and economic optimism has reached record highs. 

In TX-36 alone, families will now be taking home an average of $19,417 in additional income over the next 10 years thanks to these tax cuts. I have heard story after story of how this extra money is helping to start new businesses, put children through school, or rebuild after the destruction of Hurricane Harvey. These are real world results, not political rhetoric. 

I look forward to continuing to work in Congress to pass policies that help American families, as well as the good folks of the TX-36.  
Service Academy Application Deadline Approaching 
One of the distinct honors of serving in the U.S. House of Representatives is the opportunity to nominate exceptional young men and women from the 36th Congressional District to be considered for an appointment to our nation’s service academies. If you are a student interested in attending one of these academies, mark your calendar for the application deadline on October 1st, 2018.   Visit my website to easily access the online application and the list of required documents.  For additional information, please call Rachel Iglesias at (409)331-8066.

Another Bill on its way to the President... 
Dear Friend:
As we quickly approach the end of August, I want to bring you this quick update. As always, I appreciate your time and it’s an honor representing you!   Back in June, I wrote about my bill, H.R. 2147, the ‘Veterans Treatment Court Improvement Act’. After extensive legislative work and bipartisan negotiations, the House passed this bill in June. On Wednesday, the Senate passed it by unanimous consent! H.R. 2147 will now head to the President’s desk for his signature and is soon expected to become law.   This legislation requires the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) to hire 50 additional Veterans Justice Outreach (VJO) specialists to aid in the rehabilitation of veterans caught up in the criminal justice system due to convictions on misdemeanor offenses. Under the expansion of this program, more veterans will be diverted from serving sentences behind bars to Veterans Treatment Courts providing them with a second chance by participating in a court-mandated treatment program with services coordinated and provided for by the VA. Currently, there are not enough VJO specialists to serve all of the veterans eligible. Veterans Treatment Courts are designed to deal directly with behavioral problems associated with PTSD, substance abuse, and anger management—symptoms that are often associated with repeated combat tours of duty.   Veterans Treatment Courts are a success story, and I introduced this legislation after personally witnessing participants take part in the diversion program of the 17th Judicial District in Adams County. I’m also aware that in the 18th Judicial District's (Arapahoe, Douglas, Elbert and Lincoln counties) Veterans Treatment Court program has a success rate of 73% of veterans who make it through the program and remain out of the criminal justice system. This is a true win-win for both veterans, their families, and for our country. I’m thankful to my colleagues for helping me in getting this important bill across the finish line.

U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman met with Army Medical Recruiting Commander Cpt. Nelson Kranz (left) & Sgt. First Class Scott Farrell (right)

On the same day, I met with the leadership of the Army Medical Recruiting Command to discuss the challenges they face in recruiting medical professionals to serve in the United States Army— both active and reserve. As the Chairman of the Military Personnel Subcommittee for the House Armed Services Committee, recruiting falls under my subcommittee’s jurisdiction. As you know, obtaining the qualified medical personnel is hard and the Army has to compete with the civilian demands to meet its medical personnel needs. The Army Medical Recruiters briefed me on what they are doing to attract and retain highly qualified medical personnel in the State of Colorado and around the country. While financial incentives such as pay, bonuses, and educational benefits help in attracting the appropriate candidates, that alone is not sufficient. Our recruiters must also stress and inspire these young potential recruits to fully appreciate the value of serving our country.

Finally, just like the rest of American's last evening, I was heartbroken to hear about the passing of Sen. John McCain. My deepest sympathies are with his family and friends at this time. The Senator was an extraordinary leader, a war hero, and a great public servant. His legacy and service to our Nation won't be forgotten. I will miss not seeing him in the halls of Congress. 
As always, I invite you to follow me on Facebook or Twitter to get the latest news it develops. Likewise, you can find all the latest news on my website. I look forward to seeing you around the district the rest of August!

August 26, 2018
Dear Friend,  
This week has been very exciting.  I was able to meet with countless constituents and continue my work on issues that I know matter most to you, such as reducing the cost of prescription drugs, facilitating critical research into developing treatments for diseases, and protecting our Veterans and vulnerable Floridians.  In this divisive political climate, I feel honored to have the privilege to build consensus by working across the aisle and getting things done on your behalf. 
Continue reading to learn about some of the highlights of my work this week!  
Lowering the Cost of Rx Drugs, Ensuring Quality Healthcare and Supporting Critical Research
Too often we have seen the price of lifesaving medication skyrocket due to bad actors taking advantage of monopolies in the market. The dramatic spike in cost for medications, like the EpiPen, prompted me to push for these critical reforms. Sick people should never be held hostage so a pharmaceutical company can increase its’ profits. Last week, the FDA announced its approval of a generic version of the EpiPen through the process developed as a result of my legislation.  I am thrilled that my legislative efforts are already translating into lower costs for patients and look forward to seeing the reduction of cost for many more prescription drugs.  Click here to read more about this exciting development.  I am proud of the initial success we are having, through our collaborative efforts with the Administration, in reducing the price of  lifesaving medication.  I will continue to work on this important issue.
￼ 
Another important issue is ensuring access to high quality, affordable health care.  Over 25 million Americans receive primary care, dental and mental health services at a federally funded community health center.  In addition to getting my bill to reauthorize community health centers signed into law earlier this year, I fought for full funding of these vital resources in this year’s budget. Additionally, I successfully pushed for community health centers to receive a portion of the $4 billion we allocated to address the opioid crisis. Now, community health centers will be able to expand their services to include treatment for substance abuse. Improved access to treatment is very important, and community health centers can be integral in helping us achieve that goal. As these centers plan to meet this need in communities across the country, it is critical that they have sustained funding, which is why I co-authored a bi-partisan letter to the leadership of both parties requesting support through the Fiscal Year 2019 appropriations process. 
Many of the most vulnerable Floridians rely on Medicaid in order to access health care. I want to be sure a recent proposal doesn’t hurt those who have medical incidents that occur late in the month which is why I asked the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid to carefully scrutinize this aspect of the proposal in order to protect these individuals. 
I appreciated the opportunity to meet with Laura Milford, a constituent and rare disease patient advocate last week. We discussed the estimated 25 million Americans suffering with one of the 7,000 known rare diseases and the need for federally-funded research into treatment and cures to help these patients.
￼ 
What patients, like Laura, need is the discovery of better treatments and cures.  Last week, I had the opportunity to the University of South Florida and meet with some of the premier researchers in the country who are working to develop a break-through in neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and ALS. They are making tremendous progress, and it is important that we continue to fund this critical research.  I know all too well the personal and financial toll these diseases can also take.  Sadly, members of my own immediate family suffer from a degenerative neurological disease. I am filled with hope for my family, and millions of families across the country, when I see the progress being made right here in our own back yard. 
￼ 
Fighting for our Nation’s Heroes
ICYMI- This article notes the recent progress we have made in making sure that Veterans receive the care and benefits they deserve. I will never stop fighting on behalf of my constituents and all our nation’s heroes. 
 However, I am deeply troubled by recent reports that the VA wrongly denied sexual trauma claims made by Veterans.  This is completely unacceptable. As a member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, I look forward to conducting Congressional oversight to hold the VA accountable for their actions. We must have the appropriate safeguards in place to ensure Veterans who were wrongly denied are reexamined in an expeditious manner.
Hearing from You
Last week, I was honored to be invited to speak to a group of constituents who are members of the Association of Mature American Citizens (AMAC). We discussed the Primary Care Enhancement Act, which would give Americans more control over how they spend their health care dollars. We also discussed the Good Samaritan Charitable Physicians’ Services Act, which incentivizes pro bono work for our nation’s poorest citizens. Additionally, the group was very concerned with the need to repeal the “safe harbor” provision in the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987. They feel as though a repeal would generate significant savings within Medicare.
￼ 
I was also privileged to be invited to join local and state leaders a forum at the Beacon Woods Civic Center last week. We had a great discussion about a wide variety of topics including: the cost of prescription drugs, the importance of Medicare and Social Security programs and my work on behalf of Veterans. I always appreciate the opportunity to engage with groups of constituents to learn their views on the most pressing issues facing our nation.
￼ 
Supporting Students 
School safety has been a top priority for me.  This article discusses the financial impact that school districts are experiencing as they try to comply with the mandate for campus security, and how my bill could help alleviate those concerns. 
Additionally, with school back in session, I’d like to remind students and families about the process for applying to a U.S. Service Academy. These appointments are highly competitive and it is critical to begin planning as early as possible. I can begin accepting academy nomination applications no earlier than January of the applicant's junior year of high school. Candidates must submit their completed nomination application to my office before the close of business on September 28, 2018. I have a team of experienced military leaders from our community who conduct interviews of every candidate and make recommendations about which candidates should be nominated from the 12th Congressional district. These interviews will be held in late October. Good luck to all applicants as you begin your journey of service to our country. For more information, please click here. 
Thank you for reading this week’s update. Feel free to share this e-newsletter with friends and encourage them to sign up! Remember, you can always stay in touch with me via email, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Friends,
I was deeply saddened to hear about the passing of an American hero and statesman, Senator John McCain. He served our country with dedication and honor. My thoughts and prayers are with the Senator's family and friends during this difficult time. May he Rest in Peace. 
Protecting our Seniors
Each year, more than $37 billion is stolen from seniors in America. These scammers, and unfortunately sometimes family members, target the most vulnerable among us. Over the past few years, I have held 11 seminars in Northeast Ohio, and last week I hosted one in Trumbull County to help educate seniors on steps they can take to protect themselves from these scams.
If you or someone you know has been a target of scammers you should call 1-800-275-8777. For more information, visit the United States Postal Inspection Service Website.

Opioid Resources for Ohio
Every day, an average of 115 Americans lose their battles with opioid addiction. In Congress, my colleagues and I have spearheaded the largest federal response to a U.S. drug crisis in the history of our country. I've said this before and I'll say it again, the opioid epidemic knows no boundaries, destroying the lives of Americans across the country, regardless of gender, race, upbringing, or creed. I was instrumental in directing a total of $52,121,004 for Ohio to combat the opioid crisis. This epidemic is in everyone's backyard and this funding will directly impact and improve the lives of family members, friends, and neighbors in Northeast Ohio.

""Service Above Self"" 
It's always an honor to speak at the Willoughby Rotary Club, because they are an organization that places great emphasis on giving back to the community. After hearing inspirational stories of service, it was a pleasure to share updates from the 115th Congress with such a distinguished group of business leaders and professionals in our community.

Military Academy Information Day 
On Saturday, September 22, my office will hold our annual Military Academy Information Day. 
The event will begin at 9:30 a.m. at the Auburn Career Center's Technology Learning Center Building, located at 8221 Auburn Road in Concord Township. 
Military Academy Information Day is the perfect opportunity for students who wish to serve our country to speak with representatives from each of the military academies. Representatives from the U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Military Academy (West Point), U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, U.S. Naval Academy and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy have been invited to attend, make presentations, and take questions. 
This program is open to students of all ages and their families. Anyone who has an interest in learning more about the service academies and the nomination process is welcome to attend. 
For additional information, please contact Maureen Jeffery at 440-352-3939 or by e-mail at maureen.jeffery@mail.house.gov.

American Railroads
Freight railroads serve nearly every sector of the economy, with roughly 140,000 miles of track across the country. OH-14 is lucky to have Quality Track Equipment, a division of Delta Railroad Construction, a family-owned and operated business with over 100 employees in Ashtabula. 
I was happy to sit down with the group and discuss ways we can work together to ensure our country has the infrastructure we need to provide safety and efficiency that benefits all Americans. 
Thank you to Ashtabula County Commissioners Casey Kozlowski, Kathryn Lynn Whittington, and J.P. Ducro for accompanying us.

August 25, 2018
Greetings,
One year ago today, the Texas Gulf Coast was changed forever by Hurricane Harvey. With 135 mph winds and historic flooding, Harvey left in its wake 250 miles of devastation, from Corpus Christi to Louisiana. But we do not mark the anniversary of Harvey only in a spirit of tragedy, but also one of triumph. In the face of enormous destruction, first responders jumped into the floods to save their fellow Texans from harm’s way, and business owners and houses of worship threw open their doors to shelter those in need. Texans stood united. And that unity, along with the support of federal, state, and local partners has allowed disaster survivors and the entire Texas Gulf Coast to continue making long strides down the road to recovery over the last year. This week, I delivered remarks on the Senate floor and introduced a resolution recognizing the unity that has brought us through the storm, reiterating my commitment to seeing Texas’ recovery through to the end.
Americans have become all too familiar with the horror of school shootings. Texas is no exception. In the face of evil, horrific, violent attacks on our students, local school boards, teachers, and communities across the county have united to find a solution. Earlier this year, I participated in a school safety roundtable with Gov. Abbott, local law enforcement officials, and the victims of the Santa Fe High School, Alpine High School, and Sutherland Springs church shootings. On Tuesday, I introduced a school safety amendment to empower local communities and education officials with the resources they need to reinforce school safety and keep our children safe. This amendment expands the use of Student Support and Academic Enrichment (SSAE) grants so that our schools can hire school safety officers, and purchase infrastructure and technologies that keep our children safe.
On Friday, I had the honor of participating in the ribbon cutting ceremony for the Army Futures Command in Austin, Texas. As a pillar in America’s defense, military readiness, and national security, it is only fitting that the Army Futures Command call Texas home. Here in the Lone Star State, we take seriously the defense of our great country. Given our long history of proud military service, and Austin’s booming innovative technology sector and equipped workforce, Texas is ready and able to ensure the Army succeeds in this new mission. I am eager to continue working with the Army to ensure they are modernized and ready to deter aggression, promote peace, and project American strength.
As we continue to rebuild from the unprecedented devastation from Hurricane Harvey, we must also take all steps necessary to prepare for the hurricane season ahead. For those seeking information or assistance during the recovery and rebuilding process, please do not hesitate to contact my office or use the federal and state resources listed here. For those seeking preparedness information and resources, please refer to the federal and state resources listed here.

Hurricane Harvey Anniversary 
Harvey, one year later; how our community came together to rebuild and recover.
By: Congressman Kevin Brady
 



Today marks the one year anniversary of when Hurricane Harvey made landfall. The storm was one of the most devastating in history. Harvey left hundreds of Texas families homeless and without resources, and 88 Texans lost their lives. 

Immediately following Harvey, I voiced my hope that the days after the storm would be remembered for the historic way in which the national, state and local governments responded. Looking back a year later, I am proud to say that my hopes were fulfilled. 

On day one, the Texas congressional delegation took action and worked to deliver historic relief in record time. Just six months post-Harvey, Congress was able to deliver $146 billion in relief funding. This was the quickest relief response time of any disaster aid to date. Congress leapt into action in order to ensure that aid was given to those who so desperately needed it. 

Looking back, what I remember most is how Texans came together to lend a hand and help their neighbors during our time of need. There was an outpouring of support from nearby communities and across the country, neighbors helping neighbors. Everyday people volunteered their time and resources to local shelters, and even used their own boats and cars in rescue missions. 

Our work is not done, but we have already shown what we are capable of. We have come out of this stronger than ever; ‘Texas Strong’ in fact. Because that’s what Texans do.

REBUILDING OUR MILITARY

Last week, President Trump signed the FY 19 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) into law. The NDAA is the primary way Congress meets its most important constitutional obligations to provide for the common defense by setting defense policy for the year.

I was proud to support this legislation because it provides critical support for our military in the First District. The NDAA ensures the A-10s at Moody Air Force Base keep flying, supports future missions at Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base and more. The legislation also includes an extremely well-deserved pay raise for our troops - the largest in nearly a decade.

It also works to rebuild and grow our forces. For too long, the military has had to do more with less and it has created a dangerous readiness crisis that must be reversed. 

One of my top priorities in Congress is working to provide the brave members of our military with the support necessary to ensure they are the most well prepared and well equipped force on the planet. This includes new investments in training, equipment, and personnel and I will continue this mission. 

Click here to learn more about our work to strengthen and support our military. 

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CLXXVI

Monday, August 20, 2018:  After being out of town for 10 days and getting back last night at 10:00 p.m., I’m in downtown Savannah this morning as I take part in the Hometown Tour event with Axios, a news website.  Sponsored by Wells Fargo, the forum brings together civic and business leaders, such as Savannah Mayor Eddie Deloach and Board of Regents Vice-Chair Don Waters, to talk about educational and business challenges in our area. 
￼
Rep. Carter participates in the Hometown Tour with Axios
Next, I stay downtown for a meeting with Dr. Chip Cowart with the American Academy of Family Physicians before heading to Richmond Hill for a meeting with city officials and Rayonier representatives to discuss the exciting plans for the Belfast project.  This private/public project will include a new interchange on I-95 as well as new schools, roads and commercial and residential developments.  Along with Georgia representatives Ron Stephens and Jesse Petrea, I am brought up to date on the progress of the project as well as challenges that the project is facing.  Next, I head back to downtown Savannah where I participate in a restaurant roundtable with local members of the Georgia Restaurant Association to discuss workforce issues.  Afterwards, I head to Macon for the Georgia Chamber of Commerce Congressional Luncheon to be held tomorrow.  During the always exciting I-16 drive, I have a phone interview with the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) for an article in their magazine about my experience serving on a community bank board before I became a member of Congress.

Tuesday, August 21, 2018: After participating in the Chamber of Commerce Congressional Luncheon by introducing the singer of the National Anthem, I enjoy listening to Georgia’s two nominees for Governor.  Afterwards, along with my good friend and fellow delegation member Rep. Drew Ferguson (R-GA), I participate in a breakout session to discuss trade and the impact of tariffs.  Next, I head to Atlanta and while in route have a phone discussion with Savannah businessman Clint Land to learn more about his exciting business interests. 
￼
Rep. Carter discusses trade with Rep. Drew Ferguson
Once in Atlanta, I head to see my good friends at Georgia State University (GSU) in the downtown area to learn more about their work in controlling tuition rates and decreasing student debt.  GSU is the largest university in the state with over 53,000 students spread out over numerous campuses.  Recently, GSU has increased their graduation rate by utilizing, among other things, Panther Retention Grants, small emergency grants that they give to seniors who may be dropping out of school because their financial aid has runout.

Wednesday, August 22, 2018:  This morning I have the honor and privilege of meeting with the Consul General of Israel to the Southeastern U.S., Ambassador Judith Varnai Shorer.  I am a strong supporter of Israel and believe that a strong U.S.-Israel relationship is vital to the stability of the Middle East.  I find Ambassador Varnai Shorer to be most engaging and her strong interest in the First Congressional District and particularly in the Port of Savannah is highly encouraging.  Next, I head to Georgia Tech to visit the Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC), the state of Georgia’s startup incubator that was founded in 1980 by the Georgia General Assembly. 
￼
Rep. Carter meeting with the Consul General of Israel to the Southeastern U.S., Ambassador Judith Varnai Shorer
The mission of ATDC is to work with entrepreneurs in Georgia to help them learn, launch and succeed in the creation of technology companies.  Since its inception, ATDC startup companies have raised over $3 billion in investment financing and generated more than $12 billion in revenue in the state of Georgia.  After touring the facility, I meet with representatives from some of the health care related companies to learn more about the innovative and cutting edge work they are engaged in.  Next, I stay on the Georgia Tech campus and head to the Parker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience (IBB) where I meet with Executive Director Dr. Andres Garcia and learn more about the fine work being done at this research center.  Afterwards, I have a chance to tour one of the many labs and meet with some of the researchers to learn about their projects.  Next, I head to the financial services offices where I meet with the Director of the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid to discuss their experiences with tuition rates and student debt. 
￼
Rep. Carter at the Advanced Technology Development Center
My last meeting of the day is near the Capitol as I meet with University System of Georgia Chancellor Steve Wrigley and his fine staff to discuss ways to streamline some of the burdensome federal regulations that drive up costs at our universities.  I found the Chancellor and staff to be most cooperative and genuinely concerned with rising tuition costs and student debt and determined to control both.

Thursday, August 23, 2018:  I’m still in Atlanta this morning and my first trip is a visit to Innovation Compounding in Kennesaw to learn more about their outsourcing pharmacy compounding facility.  After meeting with Shawn Hodges and his fine staff, I observe their first class facilities and learn more about the important services they provide to patients across the U.S. who are in need of sterile and non-sterile pharmaceutical compounds.  Next, I head to the airport for my return trip home and, once back in Savannah, I visit Bright Life Chiropractic to tour their facility and learn more about the work they do and the challenges they face as a small business.  Afterwards, I head to my Savannah office where I have a phone call with the Consul General of Canada, Ambassador Nadia Theodore, to discuss tariffs and then participate in a Podcast with PolitiTalkRX to discuss prescription drug pricing and the opioid epidemic.  Next, I have a series of meetings in my office first with SNF Holding Company to discuss tariffs, then with a constituent to discuss campaign finance reform and finally with one of our many fine artists in the District to discuss a project she is working on. 

￼
Rep. Carter visiting Bright Life Chiropractic
Before I leave the office, I have a visit from Patti Victor with the Matthew Reardon Center as she introduces me to “Buddy” the center’s 7 week old Jack Russell who is being trained as a comfort dog.  My final stop of the day is at Savannah Technical College where I participate in an opioid symposium and have the opportunity to share with the large gathering the work that we are doing in Congress to combat this national epidemic.

Friday, August 24, 2018:  I’m happy to be visiting Bethesda Academy this morning and learning more about the fine work they’re doing at this all-boy school.  Headmaster Mike Hughes and his great staff are truly changing lives here and after visiting with some of the students, I am very impressed with the way they carry themselves and how respectful and courteous they are.  Afterwards, I head to Savannah State University to tour the Marine and Environmental Science building that I helped secure funding for while I served in the Georgia State Senate.  This state of the art facility is an asset to the First District and the state of Georgia and is a testament to the fine work that is being done at Savannah State University. 
￼
Rep. Carter discussing the opioid crisis in our community
This great facility is surpassed only by the dedicated staff and researchers that work here.  Afterwards, I head to the Georgia Historical Society in downtown Savannah where I meet with President and CEO Dr. Todd Groce to learn more about the exciting and important work being done here and the plans for renovation and expansion.  Next, I head down to Brunswick where I am the commencement speaker at the Brunswick Job Corps graduation ceremony.  This is one of the best programs in our District as it helps many of our young people obtain job skills but, perhaps more importantly, provides our employers with a high quality workforce.  Afterwards, I head to St. Simons Island where I have been invited by members of the Cassina Garden Club to tour the Hamilton Plantation Slave Cabins that they have restored.  Located on Gascoigne Bluff near Fort Frederica, the club began meeting here in 1932 and was deeded the property in 1950.  This fine group of dedicated preservationists have carefully restored and preserved the integrity of the cabins and because of their great work, a piece of our area’s history will be witnessed by generations to come.

Amish Roots 
￼
On Wednesday afternoon, I visited Dutch Meadows Farm in Lancaster County. One issue of importance for this family farm is federal policy related to raw milk. Our area is known for the best raw milk in the country, and it's highly sought after. It's also critically important to many family farms throughout our district. Yet bizarrely, the federal government regulates it so it can't be sold across state lines. 
Dutch Meadows delivers its products all around our community. All of their products are humanely raised, grass-fed, and organically pastured - they have quite the operation! I was thrilled to be able to get a tour of the farm - and I  drove the buggy pulled by a horse named Beauty (pictured above) - reliving one of the experiences I had being born into an Amish family. 
 
Assisting Our Veterans 
￼ 
More than 200 people showed up for the veterans benefits expo I hosted on Tuesday morning at Willow Valley! This was a great opportunity to help veterans and their families get the services they have earned and deserve. Pictured on the left is Lancaster County Recorder of Deeds Ann Hess. She and her staff worked during the event to provide veterans with an ID card. 
Here's a snapshot of the event: 
	•	120 veterans signed up for their Veterans ID Card
	•	The oldest veteran in attendance was 94 (entered service in 1943) and the youngest was in their late 20s
	•	My office specifically helped with things like correcting military records, VA compensation claims, requests for discharge documents, and enrolling veterans in VA health plans 
If you are a veteran, or if you know a veteran, and you're having trouble with a federal agency like the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, I may be able to help. Call my office at 717-393-0667 to find out how I can help!  
 
Opening Ceremony at Elizabethtown Fair 
￼ 
Did you know that Pennsylvania has 109 fairs? The Elizabethtown Fair kicks off our annual fair season and I look forward to it each year. It's a great opportunity to learn about our local agricultural industry, connect with neighbors, and enjoy some delicious food. I was glad to be invited to participate in the opening ceremony on Monday evening and to speak with so many constituents! 
 
Manufacturing on the Rise 
￼ 
On Wednesday morning I had the opportunity to visit Pennsy Supply Inc. in Manheim where I was shown around the facility and held a town hall with employees where I heard about the work they're doing and answered any questions they had. 
Pennsy Supply is the leading manufacturer of aggregate, sand, asphalt, and concrete throughout north and central Pennsylvania, providing materials for commercial construction, infrastructure development, and residential buildings.
Pennsy has been operating in our community for nearly 100 years, and operates over 15 asphalt plants, 12 aggregate quarries, 3 sand sites, and 6 ready mix concrete plants. We're luck to have these hardworking employees supporting our local economy, and I'm glad to see Republican policies helping manufacturers across Pennsylvania and the nation.

8/26/18 7:01,3 bills for the Great Lakes,"
￼
￼

Email Update: August 26, 2018  

Dear Lindsey, 

For this week’s newsletter, I wanted to share some of the most significant legislation that Congress has passed to continue to help keep our Great Lakes beautiful and healthy. As the largest freshwater system in the world, the Great Lakes are an unparalleled economic driver supporting jobs, transportation, recreation, tourism and agriculture for people across the United States.   

Below are three big pieces of legislation that the House has passed that benefit our Great Lakes:


1. H.R. 6147: The Department of Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2019, the Interior Appropriations bill contains a total of $35.3 billion, funding programs that protect and make the best use of domestic natural resources, that provide investments in infrastructure such as improvements for drinking water systems, and that help protect against and fight devastating wildfires. The bill also makes strides to rein in harmful regulations at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Furthermore, it includes full funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI). The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has made great strides in protecting our beautiful Great Lakes. Since 2010, GLRI has shown real and measurable results, from restoring native habitats, to combating invasive species, to improving water quality. This funding is vital in keeping the Great Lakes healthy and I applaud my colleagues in both the House and Senate for passing this important legislation. To learn more about this bill, please follow this link. 

2. HR. 8: The Water Resource Development Act of 2018, also known as WRDA, is the vehicle by which Congress authorizes critical improvements to our nation’s water resource infrastructure including ports, locks, dams, and flood protection. The bill included an amendment authored by Congressman Mitchell (MI-10) and Congressman Davis (IL-13) that will protect the Great Lakes from invasive species like Asian carp by requiring the Army Corps of Engineers to expedite completion of the Brandon Road Study. The Brandon Road Lock and Dam system is one of the last stops along the Des Plaines River keeping Asian carp out of Lake Michigan and the entire Great Lakes system. I am proud to have supported this vital legislation so that we can continue to keep invasive species like Asian Carp out of our Great Lakes. To learn more about WRDA, please follow this link. 

3. H.R. 5895: The Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, a bill which invests in many programs that help veterans, invests in American infrastructure, and advances safe nuclear storage far from the Great Lakes. Specifically, this bill invests in American water resources infrastructure through the Army Corps of Engineers, which has oversight of critical projects, such as upgrades to the Soo Locks. It also repeals the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule, and upholds the balanced, federal-state partnership that has regulated our waterways for over 40 years under the Clean Water Act. Finally, this bill continues congressional efforts to reopen the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada, which will move nuclear waste off the shores of the Great Lakes to a permanent secure location. To learn more about this bill, please follow this link. 

More than 40 million people get their drinking water from the Great Lakes, more than 3,500 species of plants and animals also live in the Great Lakes basin, and I am proud that the House is committed to passing legislation to keep our Great Lakes beautiful for years to come. As always, if there is anything that my office can do to be of assistance to you, please do not hesitate to contact either our Troy or Washington offices. 

Thank you and best wishes.

Dear Friend,  One year ago, the outer bands of Harvey were just beginning to sweep across the coast. Many of us having lived on the Gulf Coast most of our lives knew what to expect - hunker down, have extra supplies, help your neighbors. We'd all seen hurricanes before, but no one was prepared for Harvey...  The first four days, we didn't see the sun. We were inundated with over 50 inches of water.  The first ten days were filled with shelter visits and emergency notices.  The first several weeks were spent watching the water recede and getting home to salvage personal belongings.  The first couple of months were a blur of mucking out homes, tearing down walls, and drying out what little was left.  During the course of the first year, 82 disaster recovery centers were up and running; 895,503 individuals registered with disaster assistance programs; 3 disaster relief packages received the President's signature; and most importantly, there was an abundance of help and hope.  
￼

From Friday, August 25 through about Tuesday, August 29, rain fell from the sky in unprecedented amounts. The National Weather Service created a new color to record our rainfall, and Jeff Lindner, meteorologist with the Harris County Flood Control District, dutifully updated us with each passing hour. Our first responders, emergency services, Coast Guard, neighbors, and volunteers worked around the clock to rescue people from rising water. 

￼

Once the rain finally stopped falling, local leaders and I took to the sky for flyovers, surveying the damage and assessing where help and funding would be most critically needed. 

￼

Harvey may have brought the downpour, but YOU brought the outpour. From the Cajun Navy to strangers with johnboats and jet skis, from Team Rubicon to neighbors and college students lending a hand, help was never far. Everyone knew someone who needed help, and everyone helped someone in need. Some of you lost everything, and your first thought was still, ""I need to help and give back to my community."" Thank YOU.

￼

From the moment Harvey's devastation began making itself known, your Texas Delegation started coming together. In the days following the rain, we met with local and state officials. In the weeks and months following, your Texas Delegation - Republicans and Democrats, Senators and Representatives - met to address the problem at a hand. We worked with Leadership and the President to make sure we got the relief supplements we so desperately needed to get us back on our feet. 

￼

Stories of heroism are everywhere, but this young man's story is particularly inspiring. On August 26, Harvey's unrelenting downpour was quickly making bad situations worse. On that same day, Virgil Smith acted with a type of selflessness few people possess. He showed strength and kindness in the darkest of hours. He let his faith be bigger than his fear. Quiet and unafraid, Virgil entered the rising floodwaters time and time again to rescue friends and neighbors using his family's air mattress. Over the course of four hours, this young man of 13-years-old saved the lives of 17 others. 

In March, I had the honor of spending the day with him and his mom, Lisa. At a dinner that night,  Virgil received the Young Hero award from the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation, Citizen Honors. Each year, five people are awarded a Citizen's Honor in recognition for their act of valor.

Harvey forever left an impression on us. In the midst of everything though, Harvey reminded us that UNITED we can accomplish anything.

Congressman Smith's E-news: August 25, 2018  ￼  I recently spoke at the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce's Federal Legislative Summit along with the rest of our congressional delegation. This annual event is always a great opportunity to speak with Nebraska's small business leaders to learn how we can best advocate for them in Washington.    
Auditing the Federal Reserve  
The Federal Reserve, or Fed, is responsible for overseeing the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks and administering monetary policy. Founded by Congress in 1913 in response to the panic run on banks of 1907, the Fed is a semi-public institution charged with ensuring low unemployment, stabilizing prices by controlling inflation, and moderating long-term interest rates. Ideally speaking, it accomplishes these goals by controlling the size and growth rate of our money supply, that is by buying and selling Treasury securities which is sometimes referred to as “printing money.”   The Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors is comprised of seven presidentially-appointed members serving 14 year terms. It is considered a semi-public institution because it is an arm of the federal government, but each of its governors is expected to act independently without interference from political interests. In an effort to preserve this independence, the Fed was designed to fund itself through investments, which netted around $100 billion in 2015, the majority of which was deposited into the Treasury to pay the government’s bills.   The Fed’s role in our economy has expanded over the years in response to catastrophic events such as the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Great Recession of the 2000s, but its transparency measures, unfortunately, have not. This is why I, along with many Americans, support action by Congress to mandate auditing the Fed on an annual basis. Financial markets function most efficiently when information is both timely and accurate. Large swings in the stock market, for example, are commonly attributed to surprises such as unexpectedly bad – or good –earnings announcements or unforeseen action by an increasingly activist Fed.   We know the Fed currently owns around $4.5 trillion in assets, but because no routine audit mechanism exists, we have no idea what they are and the Fed chairman is not required to disclose them in testimony to Congress. I have cosponsored the Federal Reserve Transparency Act every Congress since it was first introduced, including in 2012 and 2014 when it passed the House as standalone legislation, and in 2016 when it passed the House as part of a broader package of Fed reforms. Unfortunately, the Senate has not yet passed a similar bill. Annual audits would provide this backward looking transparency while preserving its entitlement to private deliberation. With that said, changes to the Fed should be carefully considered with special consideration given to preserving and increasing its absolute independence from political interests.   Many people believe the Fed’s easy money policies were at least partially to blame for the severity of the financial crisis of 2008. There were early indicators of a housing bubble, but the market was not allowed to provide the necessary feedback mechanisms to stem investment into toxic assets. Instead, the Fed continued to pump “cheap” money at artificially low interest rates well beyond the point at which the market should have contracted making its eventual contraction an outright crash.   Increased transparency into the Fed’s decisions and asset ownership would not only provide additional information to stabilize markets, but also discourage actions based on ulterior motives, political or otherwise. The American people and their duly elected representatives in Congress have every right to know the inner workings of their government. Auditing the Fed on an annual basis would be a great step in that direction.

Dear Friend,
This week at the Delta Days in the Bootheel, I’ll be wrapping up a 30-county, monthlong swing through southern Missouri’s unique agriculture industry. I’m grateful to all the farmers, organizations, and agribusinesses who have taken the time to share with me their successes, what makes their farm unique, and their concerns with the federal government. Over the past month I’ve traveled the back roads of southern Missouri to listen to local farmers because when the agriculture industry does well, the entire country benefits. And when the agriculture industry struggles, so does main street America.....KEEP READING HERE


WHAT'S GREAT IN THE 8TH

￼
Joshua Morris, who once taught at Army Ranger School, now teaches environmental science at Drury University and raises cattle and registered Boer goats on his family farm in Rolla. He believes an understanding of agriculture helps children grow into responsible adults, and I couldn't agree more!
￼
The Workforce Development Board of southeast Missouri opened an office in Fredericktown this week. You can find out more about the services they offer to build a strong workforce and economy in southern Missouri here.
￼
The Cluck family in Mountain View was kind enough to host our agriculture summit at Cluck Ranch with local public officials. Thanks for taking the time to walk us through your operation and talk about what makes Missouri a great place to raise a family, and in their case, thousands of sheep and goats!
￼
Elizabeth Cureton recently took over the Cureton Livestock Market, making her one of the few women who run sale barns in Missouri. She's already getting her son Cash involved, making it a third generation business! Thanks for the great discussion on how we can strengthen family operations in Missouri. (📸by Victoria Kemper, Democrat News)

Books from the Library of Congress have a new home in Crawford County! I donated 20 boxes of books to the county library system, which will be distributed between the Bourbon, Cuba, and Steelville branches.

NFIB Awards Guardian of Small Business
I was privileged to visit Midwest Groundcover this past week, where I met with the owners, operators and employees of this impressive local business. While visiting, I had the great honor of receiving the National Federation of Independent Business’ Guardian of Small Business Award for outstanding support of small business owners in the 115th Congress.
I am proud to have maintained a 100% rating with NFIB during my tenure in Congress, and I am committed to continue working for these job creators to relieve the burden of crippling taxes, lessen regulatory restrictions and increase access to capital to allow them to grow and create jobs.
￼
NFIB Senior Director for Federal Government Relations, Kevin Kuhlman, presents the award to Rep. Hultgren, alongside Peter Orum, founder of Midwest Groundcovers and its family of companies. 

District Constituents Participate in Town Halls Across the 14th
I recently wrapped up a series of Town Hall Meetings that were held throughout the 14th District. I greatly appreciated the opportunity to answer questions and learn from you and your neighbors. 
As I often say, no two people ever agree 100% of the time, but I am grateful that folks from all over the district with different viewpoints were able to come together, ask important questions and get a firsthand account of what’s being done in Washington.
The best ideas I bring to Washington are the ones I get from the people I represent, people like you. I hope you will stay in touch and reach out to me anytime to share your thoughts and views, by calling, emailing or writing.

National Startup Week
Last week was National Startup Week! This was a great opportunity to showcase small businesses as the engine of job growth in this country, and to highlight how entrepreneurship provides the spark and fuel for them. 
The fabric of our nation is literally woven with the ambition and hope of entrepreneurship and the recognition that anyone, from any background, can innovate, persevere and build a business. 
I had the great honor of joining Representative Suzan Delbene (D-Wash.) to kick-off Startup Week and share our thoughts with The Hill.
Startups play an integral role in the economy, give them the resources that help them to succeed

Weekly Update: Our Economy – Better Off Now By Rob Wittman August 25, 2018  Two years ago, House Republicans laid out a bold policy agenda called A Better Way to tackle some of the biggest challenges of the day, including reforming the tax and regulatory system to work for all Americans. We are now delivering on those promises. After years of sluggish growth, our economy is finally making a comeback. The policies we planned and passed this Congress are unleashing historic economic growth; last month, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. economy accelerated to a 4.1% growth rate.  Since passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and rolling back countless burdensome regulations, we have seen unbelievable results.  One million jobs have been created since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act became law and unemployment numbers are at their lowest point in decades. In July, Virginia added 12,000 jobs and the unemployment fell to 3.1%; over the past twelve months, Virginia added 62,600 jobs – incredible. With more job opportunities and lower unemployment, consumer confidence is on the rise and Americans are finally having a chance to become full participants in our economy and achieve the American Dream.  We are also seeing Americans taking home more of their hard-earned money. Thanks to a doubling of the standard deduction and lower tax rates, 90% of Americans saw bigger paychecks this year. Plus, more than 4 million Americans at 642 companies have seen raised wages, bonuses, and expanded retirement options. In fact, more than half of small businesses have plans to expand, boost hiring, or increase employee benefits.  I have spent August traveling the First District and I’ve heard countless stories of how businesses are benefitting from the economy, whether it’s passing savings along to employees and consumers or investing back in their business. Just last week, I visited McLane MidAtlantic, Mapei, and the Rouse Center in Fredericksburg and Stafford, and I’ve been proud to tell folks how I will keep fighting for policies that help businesses flourish.  There is much more work to be done, but one thing is for certain: the American people are better off now. Republican economic policies are improving the lives of Virginians and allowing families to have greater confidence in their financial future. Congress is back in session on September 4, and I will be ready to take all the ideas I’ve heard from you this August to fight for an even better America.

TRAVELING FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY This week, I took to Pittsburg, Latimer, Ottawa, Craig, and Rogers counties to meet with Oklahomans on issues that matter to them.
On Tuesday, I enjoyed sitting down with Oklahomans for Independent Living to learn about how their program encourages individuals of all ages, with all types of disabilities, to live a fulfilling and independent life within their communities.  
￼
It was great to spend time with Mayor John Brown and City Manager Pete Stasiak of McAlester. We discussed transportation challenges in McAlester, including the new highway construction, and the McAlester Army Ammunition Plant.  
￼
The Arkansas-Oklahoma Railroad Company, founded in 1996, operates a growing 118 miles of railway. I was grateful to visit with members of their team on Wednesday which is still a family owned and operated business.  
￼
I stopped by the Latimer County Hospital to visit their facility and meet with administrators. They kindly presented me with a plaque for standing up for rural hospitals—a necessity for our rural communities like Wilburton. 
￼
It was an honor to present Veteran James Collins of Miami with his well-deserved decorations this week. As a Corporal in the United States Army, he served 10 months and 10 days in Korea and was awarded the Combat Medic Badge, the Korean Service Medal with a bronze star attachment, and the UN Service Medal. My office can help obtain earned military medals for veterans. Contact one of my veterans’ caseworkers at 918-687-2533 or write me an email. 
￼

All Settlers’ Day is a Vinita tradition – and I was glad to meet this year’s Will Rogers Rodeo sweetheart and Vinita Rodeo queen! 
￼
￼
 I held a coffee and conversation in Claremore on Thursday. I enjoyed visiting with constituents and McDonald’s team members about a variety of topics. Thanks to everyone who stopped by! 
￼
I also hosted a Senior Citizens Information Fair at the Claremore Senior Citizens Center to assist anyone who needed help filing a Social Security claim or getting answers from the Social Security Administration. Enjoyed visiting with everyone! If we can help you with an issue you’re having with a federal agency, contact my office at 918-687-2533.
￼
It was great to meet with ORU Board Trustee Billy Wilson, State Senator Wayne Shaw and State Representative Tom Gann to talk about Inola’s recent report on its infrastructure-waste water issues. It’s always great to be in contact with our state and local community officials so we see what role—if any—the federal government should be playing in our infrastructure issues. 
￼
I met with directors of Light of Hope and the Stonebrook Project in Claremore to learn more about the good work they’re doing to help families and individuals who are facing the struggle of addiction and life difficulties—free of charge. Tyson Food also donated truckloads of food to benefit the individuals they help. Watch a clip about the event, courtesy of Fox 23, at this link.  
￼
I enjoyed speaking at the Owasso Chamber Legislative luncheon on Friday to give them an update from Washington, D.C. and answer their questions. Thanks for having me!
￼
 WEEKLY WRAP-UP I hosted a coffee and donuts today so that I can meet Oklahomans like you and learn how I can help problem solve to get the federal government out of the way. This Congress, I’m proud to say that I voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to let Oklahomans keep more of what they earn and drive down unemployment rates in our communities. Watch the weekly wrap-up on my Facebook or YouTube page. 
￼
 See more from this past week on my Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr pages and as always, don’t hesitate to contact me if I can help in any way.
Thank you, ￼

Friends,   What a week! After kicking things off with a visit from President Trump and welcoming the administration’s proposed Affordable Clean Energy plan announcement, the Senate wrapped up another productive week by passing two additional government funding bills—all developments that West Virginians stand to benefit from. Get a sneak peek at some of this news by clicking here or the image below, and keep scrolling for more exciting updates from this week in the Senate. 
￼ 
 Back Home in West Virginia
Whenever I’m back home in West Virginia, I hear from so many individuals—whether they are small business owners, students, teachers, or community leaders—about how the Republican pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda has improved their lives.  Just last week, I made several stops in Wheeling and Huntington where I heard even more about how West Virginians who are already seeing positive results from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Take Warwood Tool in Wheeling for example. During my visit, employees told me that they are planning to create a new line of products thanks, in part, to tax reform. This is real and tangible progress, and Warwood Tool is not alone. I’m hearing similar stories just like this one all across our great state.   In Huntington, I had the chance to host my friend Senator Tim Scott for the day, where we made a number of stops focused on economic development and Opportunity Zones, a federal program that offers tax incentives to promote private investment in economically distressed areas. Opportunity Zones provide another chance for revitalization and growth in our state. Cities like Huntington can really benefit from this provision of the new tax cuts law, and it was exciting to hear about how local leaders plan to attract new investment to the area. Click here or the image below to catch a glimpse into our visits in Huntington. 
  
￼ 
  
Rolling Back Burdensome Regulations 
In addition to pro-growth reforms like tax reform, the Trump administration has followed through on its promise to roll back burdensome and misguided regulations. After leading the charge back in 2015 to nullify the previous administration’s so-called Clean Power Plan, I was glad to see the EPA announce on Tuesday that it is moving forward with the process of reviewing and replacing this misguided and harmful regulation.   The Clean Power Plan was a complete overreach by the federal government. Not only was the one-size-fits-all approach disastrous for West Virginia’s coal industry, but there was also absolutely no consideration for the economic effects the plan would have on an energy-rich state like ours. The proposed replacement plan, known as the Affordable Clean Energy rule, will be a positive change for West Virginia both economically and environmentally. This action is a clear signal to West Virginia and the entire nation that the war on coal is over and a new and improved approach to energy production is underway.
 Continuing to Provide Resources for WV Priorities 
On Friday, we continued to move forward with the appropriations process by passing the Defense/Labor-HHS government funding legislation. This measure provides critical funding for a variety of important issues—including priorities that range from supporting our servicemen and women and workforce development to advancing Alzheimer’s research and maximizing Pell grants for low-income students. It also includes funding I helped secure to combat the opioid epidemic.   Friday’s vote is another indication that the Republican-led Congress is restoring regular order to the appropriations process, a more responsible and more effective way to use our limited fiscal resources.

SUPPORTING COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS
￼
All across America, community health centers serve 27 million patients, and I am grateful for the innovative service and dedicated care they provide to Hoosier families.
This week I had the privilege of helping HealthLinc staff, volunteers, and patients open the doors of their newly expanded Mishawaka health center.
￼
I also had a chance to tour the Indiana Health Centers facility in South Bend and meet the hardworking providers whose dedication makes a real difference in the lives of Hoosier patients.
I will continue working with my colleagues in Congress to ensure community health centers like these have the resources needed to provide quality, affordable health care.
GROWING HOOSIER MANUFACTURING
A big thanks to these Hoosier manufacturers for the opportunity to tour their facilities and meet their incredible workers who are paving the way for continued economic growth in our region.
￼
Tuscany Motor Co. in Elkhart
The high-quality products and unmatched innovation coming from northern Indiana manufacturers like these show the positive direction our country is moving in. 
￼
Tenneco Automotive in Elkhart
Our local manufacturers are hiring more workers, growing and expanding capabilities, and boosting our economy, and it doesn’t look like they plan on slowing down anytime soon.
￼
Bennington in Elkhart
HONORING HOOSIER HEROES
￼
It was an unforgettable honor to present two Hoosier veterans with the military service medals they earned while serving our country years ago.
￼
James Stemmler bravely served his country in the U.S. Army in Vietnam. Now he serves his fellow veterans and helps honor the memory of America’s fallen heroes. I had the privilege of presenting him the medals he earned but never received.
￼
Tom Hollis proudly displays his military service medals, but two were missing. I was honored to present him with these decorations, including the Valorous Unit Award earned in Operation Desert Storm.
As always, it is a privilege to represent 2nd District Hoosiers in Congress.

Congressional Report

Dear Friends, 
This week I attended various meetings with individuals and organizations, including a visit to the Facebook Headquarters in California. 

My staff also attended several events including meetings with Veterans in Laredo and La Vernia. They also met with representatives from different agencies and organizations throughout the district, including Volunteers Serving the Need CEO & Founder Gigi Ramos, and the Sheriff from Hidalgo County J.E. Guerra. 

Lastly, I have included a video from the Federal Emergency Management Agency that provides useful information about the dangers of high temperatures and humidity, and useful tips on how to remain safe during this season.

As always, please contact one of my offices if you need any assistance with any federal agency.


Remembering Harvey One Year Later

As we approach the one-year mark of Hurricane Harvey’s landfall on August 25th, we remember the devastation and destruction suffered by hundreds of thousands of Texans.  We also take pride in the stories of survivors and the response and willingness of so many Texans and neighbors who came to the aid of those affected.  While Texans have made great progress to rebuild, we want to bring a number of important deadlines and resources to your attention: 
	•	Many insurance policies have a one-year deadline.  If you have not already filed a claim for Harvey-related damages, be sure to check with your insurance company on the deadline.
	•	On April 18, 2018, the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association extended the deadline for policyholders to request an appraisal on their Harvey claim.  The new deadline is 180 days from the day a policyholder received their most recent Notice of Claim Acceptance letter. Click here for more information.
	•	For a list of resources and additional information to help you recover from Hurricane Harvey, visit FEMA’s Texas Disaster Mitigation page.
	•	As we are currently in hurricane season thru November, please visit the Texas Governor’s site to ensure you have taken recommended steps to protect your family and home.

Weekly Review
 

August 18

Health Savings Accounts: Under the category of continuing to catch up on legislative details, last month the House voted on two bills that would expand Health Savings Accounts. In a technical sense, the measures proposed did more than that, but I believe that the most interesting portion of these bills was tied to their change to Health Savings Accounts. Specifically, H.R. 6311 and H.R. 6199, both by a vote of 242 to 176 and 277 to 142, respectively. I voted for both bills.
If you believe in market principles, health savings accounts are a vital cornerstone to improving our country’s healthcare delivery system. There will always be unlimited demand for a product that someone else pays for. This is the dynamic built into our healthcare delivery system. One is either on a governmental program, wherein once eligible, individuals don’t have incentives to limit demand. Or one is on private insurance, and outside of co-pays or caps, there is the feeling that someone else is paying for the healthcare services rendered. Click here to read more.

Digital Media Consumption: I found this chart startling.
What it shows is that people’s time on cell phones has basically doubled over the last five years from 1.6 hours a day to 3.3 hours a day. That’s a startling change in human behavior over just 5 years.
At one level, it’s a reflection of what we all know as we navigate the world of email, texts, social media, and more on mobile platforms. But here’s the interesting part, the average person still spends more than 2 hours a day on a computer.
This means the average American is spending a combined 6 hours a day looking at some sort of screen.
I find that perplexing and alarming, given its implications for old-time social interaction.
I certainly see it when I go to a restaurant...with the number of people that you’ll see using their cell phones as they sit looking at the screen rather than talking to other people around the dinner table. I see it as well with my boys, who give me a very hard time for not texting. My point is that I can’t even keep up with email. Why would I start something new with this revolutionary new thing called text?!
So I get it that I might be a dinosaur on this stuff…but I looked at this chart, and it really did jump out at me, given the way computer usage didn’t go dramatically down, while mobile usage went dramatically up.
I’d be curious to get your thoughts….

Internet Trends Report: Since I posted Monday on a page from Mary Meeker’s 2018 internet trends report, can I circle back to Mary Meeker? I’ve never met her, but I kind of have a crush on her. I say that in the most economic and fiscally conservative terms. Here’s what I’m trying to get at…before she joined Kleiner Perkins, she was at Morgan Stanley and wrote two amazingly comprehensive reports on the federal budget. Click here to read more.

Student Loan Debt: I read an interesting article last Monday in the Wall Street Journal in which the CEO of Chubb Insurance talked about the problem with government flood insurance. In simplest form, his point was that by subsidizing risk, we wind up with more of it. So that which may help an individual policyholder collectively works against the good of all policyholders and the taxpayers who support the program.
But I bring this up to highlight the larger principle that we see at work all too often in government, wherein the best of intentions oddly leads to unforeseen and negative consequences.
This is proven definitely to be the case with government’s involvement in student loans and aid. When I was governor, I saw first-hand the escalation of college tuitions that dovetail perfectly with the increased money that came into the state system as a consequence of lottery scholarships. That which was intended to help in pricing in fact escalated pricing. Click here to read more.

Op-Ed on Our Flood Legislation: I wanted to draw your attention to an op-ed in The Post and Courier highlighting a bill that Congressman Blumenauer and I recently introduced in the House and Senator Tim Scott introduced in the Senate. It’s called the “Promoting Flood Risk Management Act” and it aims to protect both homeowners and taxpayers from the current destructive cycle of flood, rebuild, flood, rebuild. I think it’s particularly relevant given the ways we’re seeing increased flooding in the Lowcountry.
The current buyout process is too long for homeowners and too costly for taxpayers, particularly considering that 2% of the homes in the National Flood Insurance Program have seen repetitive losses and, accordingly, account for 30% of total payouts. Here’s a snippet of the article:
“South Carolina is not alone in dealing with homes that are susceptible to flooding. The National Flood Insurance Program has paid $5.5 billion to rebuild more than 30,000 of the nation’s most flood-prone homes an average of five times. Roughly half of these 30,000-plus properties have suffered damages that exceed what the property is worth, underscoring that it would be cheaper to help interested homeowners move somewhere safer.
As residents of West Ashley have experienced firsthand, even when the owners of these homes want to move somewhere safer and it would be a better use of taxpayer dollars to help them relocate, it’s difficult and time-consuming to secure assistance to make that happen. People can be left in limbo for years, wondering if and when assistance will arrive or if they will flood again.
The legislation that Sen. Scott and Rep. Sanford have introduced will find out why homeowners, like those in West Ashley, become trapped in an endless pattern of rebuilding and have trouble obtaining assistance to move somewhere safer. The legislation requires an assessment of FEMA’s efforts to support repeatedly flooded homeowners and recommendations for how the agency’s procedures might be streamlined to help more people find safer places to live more quickly.”
I’d be curious to get your thoughts…

Dear Friends,  It's the summer season, a time when we look forward to relaxing and reconnecting with our friends and family and finding time for fun and enjoyment. But as we celebrate this carefree time of year, it's important for us to remain connected and aware of what is happening at home and around the world.
That is why I would like to share with you my reading picks. These are the articles and op-eds that have captured my interest this week. I believe that the work highlighted here is crucial to remaining well-informed. When each of us does our part to educate ourselves, we are better equipped to make positive contributions that benefit us all. Together, we have the power to make our community, state, and country a place of prosperity and justice for everyone.     Happy reading! All the best, ￼

The un-celebrity president
By Kevin Sullivan and Mary Jordan, The Washington Post
Jimmy Carter finishes his Saturday night dinner, salmon and broccoli casserole on a paper plate, flashes his famous toothy grin and calls playfully to his wife of 72 years, Rosalynn: “C’mon, kid.” 
￼ 
She laughs and takes his hand, and they walk carefully through a neighbor’s kitchen filled with 1976 campaign buttons, photos of world leaders and a couple of unopened cans of Billy Beer, then out the back door, where three Secret Service agents wait.  They do this just about every weekend in this tiny town where they were born — he almost 94 years ago, she almost 91. Dinner at their friend Jill Stuckey’s house, with plastic Solo cups of ice water and one glass each of bargain-brand chardonnay, then the half-mile walk home to the ranch house they built in 1961. 
On this south Georgia summer evening, still close to 90 degrees, they dab their faces with a little plastic bottle of No Natz to repel the swirling clouds of tiny bugs. Then they catch each other’s hands again and start walking, the former president in jeans and clunky black shoes, the former first lady using a walking stick for the first time. 
The 39th president of the United States lives modestly, a sharp contrast to his successors, who have left the White House to embrace power of another kind: wealth.

What Does Knee Surgery Cost? Few Know, and That’s a Problem 
By Melanie Evans, the Wall Street Journal
￼
For nearly a decade, Gundersen Health System’s hospital in La Crosse, Wis., boosted the price of knee-replacement surgery an average of 3% a year. By 2016, the average list price was more than $50,000, including the surgeon and anesthesiologist. 
Yet even as administrators raised the price, they had no real idea what it cost to perform the surgery—the most common for hospitals in the U.S. outside of those related to childbirth. They set a price using a combination of educated guesswork and a canny assessment of market opportunity.
Prompted by rumblings from Medicare and private insurers over potential changes to payments, Gundersen decided to nail down the numbers. During an 18-month review, an efficiency expert trailed doctors and nurses to record every minute of activity and note instruments, resources and medicines used. The hospital tallied the time nurses spent wheeling around VCR carts, a mismatch of available postsurgery beds, unnecessarily costly bone cement and delays dispatching physical therapists to get patients moving. 
The actual cost? $10,550 at most, including the physicians. The list price was five times that amount.

Why ""crashing the grid"" doesn't keep cyber experts awake at night
By Joe Uchill, Axios
In news stories, TV shows and at least one bestselling non-fiction book, you'll see warnings that hackers are coming to take out the U.S. electric grid, plunging the nation into democracy-ending darkness. An attack on that scale was even raised by leading intelligence officials in an Axios deep dive on global security threats. 
Reality check: The people tasked with protecting U.S. electrical infrastructure say the scenario where hackers take down the entire grid — the one that's also the plot of the ""Die Hard"" movie where Bruce Willis blows up a helicopter by launching a car at it — is not a realistic threat. And focusing on the wrong problem means we’re not focusing on the right ones. 
So, why can't you hack the grid? Here's one big reason: ""The thing called the grid does not exist,"" said a Department of Homeland Security official involved in securing the U.S. power structure.

The Daily 202: Duncan Hunter embraces the smash-mouth tactics Trump learned from Roy Cohn
By James Hohmann, the Washington Post
THE BIG IDEA: “Study the late Joseph McCarthy,” President Trump tweeted on Sunday, “because we are now in [a] period with [Bob] Mueller and his gang that make[s] Joseph McCarthy look like a baby!” 
It was an ironic ask considering that Trump’s mentor was Roy Cohn, who served as McCarthy’s hatchet man and chief counsel during the Wisconsin Republican’s red-baiting crusade right up until his censure by the Senate in 1954. 
Two decades later, Trump hired Cohn to be his lawyer when the Justice Department sued his family’s real estate business for systemically discriminating against African American tenants. On behalf of Trump and his father, Cohn filed a $100 million countersuit against the federal government, accused the DOJ of using “Gestapo-like tactics” and said the charges were not just “baseless” but “irresponsible.” The attorney even purportedly tried to pressure a senior Justice official to sanction a lower-ranking lawyer who was working on the case. After declaring that he would never settle, Trump eventually settled. The Justice Department later accused him of not living up to all the terms of the agreement. 
Justice Department later accused him of not living up to all the terms of the agreement. The parallels between Trump’s first tangle with the Justice Department and his current efforts to undermine the special counsel’s investigation into him, his campaign and his associates are striking. Once again, he’s using the tactics he learned under the tutelage of Cohn, who was his go-to fixer decades before Michael Cohen assumed the same role. Trump has pined for Cohn, someone who never betrayed him, asking associates: “Where’s my Roy Cohn?” 
Cohn is long dead, but Trump has been a practicing disciple of his approach to crisis communications for 45 years now. Deny everything. Never apologize. When someone punches, punch back 10 times harder. Attack the messenger. Muddy the water. Accuse others of what you’re accused of. Win at all costs.

These soldiers are part of a multinational force positioned within 100 miles of the Russian border to deter aggression in the region. 

Whether it’s giving our very deserving men and women in uniform the largest pay raise since 2010, or working to denuclearize North Korea, this administration and Congress have made tremendous progress in strengthening our military and making the world a safer place. 

Additionally, we have seen the remains of our fallen heroes brought home from North Korea, and we’ve withdrawn from the harmful Iran nuclear deal made by the previous administration. President Trump and Republicans understand when America is thriving and safe, so is the rest of the world; and we want to continue on this path of prosperity and increased security.

Press Release on increasing U.S. security: U.S. Withdraws from the Iran Nuclear Deal
 
 
Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-GA) today issued the following statement after President Trump announced the United States will withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran Nuclear Deal:

“President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran Nuclear Deal could not come soon enough. This bad deal – negotiated and signed by the Obama administration – only emboldened Iran’s posture in the Middle East and further antagonized one of our closest allies, Israel. Even though reinstituting sanctions on Iran alone won’t be enough to curb their quest for nuclear weapons, it is a major step toward reigning in the Iranian regime. The President sent a clear message today that America will not sit idly by and watch Iran jeopardize Americans’ safety, our allies safety, or the common interests we share around the world.”

Fifty-five cases containing what were believed to be the remains of U.S. servicemen killed during the Korean War were returned Friday, the White House said.

The cases, each draped with the flag of the United Nations, arrived aboard a U.S. military plane at Osan Air Base outside Seoul, South Korea. Earlier, the plane and its crew had traveled to Wonsan, North Korea, to collect the remains, the White House said.

Dear Friend,  In 2014, Congress passed the Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act, break-through legislation to allow individuals with disabilities to set up tax-free savings accounts to cover expenses while still retaining eligibility for critical federal assistance programs. Under this law, states are able to establish and operate ABLE programs. Washington State recently launched its program. Now, beneficiaries with accounts through Oregon’s ABLE for All Program can transfer their account to Washington for free. Additionally, according to the Washington State Department of Commerce, residents who enroll before June 30, 2019 will be able to waive the $35 account maintenance fee. For more information and instructions on how to apply, visit the program’s new website today.  A Fellow Washingtonian Made the Ultimate Sacrifice
This week, Washington lost one of its own. Chief Warrant Officer Taylor Galvin from Spokane was tragically killed when his helicopter crashed in Iraq during his 9th military deployment. I am incredibly grateful for his sacrifice and for the dedicated service of our brave service men and women. My thoughts and prayers are also with his family and his fellow troops.  A Year of Accomplishments  As we look back on the past 8 months, my colleagues and I in Congress have accomplished great things for law enforcement, seniors, children, our military, the environment, and our veterans. Here are just a few highlights of these accomplishments.  Our law enforcement and first responders fight on the front lines every day to protect our communities. This year, Congress has passed legislation that was signed into law that gives them the funding and resources they need to do their jobs. 
￼
From children to seniors, we have worked to ensure Americans of all ages continue to receive their important benefits and the programs they rely on are held to the highest standard for their protection. 
￼
Protecting our national security is one of the greatest responsibilities of Congress, and one I do not take lightly. My colleagues and I have worked hard to provide the necessary resources for military, so they can continue to keep our country safe on the front lines around the world. 
￼
Here in Washington, we are blessed with beautiful coasts, mountains, and forests and it is important that we maintain them for generations to come. Over the past 8 months, Congress has made great efforts to pass bills that will protect our lands. 
￼
America is blessed to have brave men and women who put their lives on the line to serve and protect our country. Our veterans who have dedicated their lives to protecting our country deserve to have access to the best treatments when they return home. My colleagues and I believe in this, which is why we have passed several important pieces of legislation that have now been signed into law, putting in place important reforms that will better the care our veterans receive. 
￼
District Happenings  TODAY: Barkfest & Rover Romp  Bring your dog for the Rover Romp 3K and 5K walk/run and enjoy demonstrations, exciting vendor village of booths, dog contests, inflatable obstacle course, adoptable pets and much more! Presented by the Auburn Valley Humane Society.  EVENT DETAILS: When: August 25, 9am - 1:30pm Where: Roegner Park, 601 Oravetz Rd SE, Auburn  TOMORROW: Confluence Jazz  The Downtown Issaquah Association is hosting Confluence Jazz, which will feature local and internationally-renowned jazz artists for a one-of-a-kind event at Confluence Park in downtown Issaquah. Featured artists will include Cool School Jazz, The Lloyd Chisholm Sextet, and the Cascade Jazz Ensemble. The event is free and will be held, rain or shine.  EVENT DETAILS: When: August 26, 4pm – 8pm Where: Confluence Park, 595 Rainier Blvd. N. Issaquah  Thanks for joining me this week! Tune in next weekend for more of the accomplishments Congress has had so far this year and my goals for the rest of this year.
Sincerely,
Dave

Lowering the Cost of Care and Increasing Coverage Options for East Tennesseans  
Since its passage, we’ve seen promise after promise broken when it comes to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the care it was supposed to provide all Americans. The ACA, or Obamacare, has been an abysmal failure. Under Obamacare, Tennesseans were promised more coverage options, lower costs and an easier-to-navigate health care market. What we got was the opposite: higher premiums, fewer plans and a more restrictive system that makes it difficult for patients and their families to shop for a plan that meets their needs. Ignoring warnings that Obamacare would fail, Democrats pressed on to push Obamacare through, despite the fact the only thing bipartisan about the law was its opposition. Make no mistake: Democrats in Congress who supported Obamacare have full ownership of its failures. 
Now, many of those same Democrats are calling for even more radical “reforms” we can’t afford when we know they won’t work, even going so far as to claim a single-payer system would save trillions of dollars. We know that’s false – in fact, some estimates have projected this proposal would actually cost more than $30 trillion in the first ten years and $218 trillion over 30 years. Even if current tax rates were doubled, we would not have the revenue to pay for a health care system like this. A recent Washington Post fact check rated the claim that such a system would save money with three Pinocchios, which means there are “significant factual errors and/or obvious contradictions – the statement is in the realm of ‘mostly false.’” While some Democrats continue to double down on systems we’ve seen fail around the world, Republicans in Congress are working with President Trump to provide Americans relief from Obamacare while taking action to increase options for coverage and lower costs. 
As you may know, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated the penalty for the individual mandate, meaning families who cannot afford insurance are not taxed for going without coverage. Still, we know that simply providing relief from the burdensome penalties of Obamacare isn’t enough, which is why earlier this month, the Trump administration announced an expansion of short-term, limited duration insurance (STLDI) plans. This expansion will provide coverage options for the Americans left behind by the high costs and slim offerings of the ACA, and the administration estimates these plans will cost between 50 to 80 percent less than Obamacare plans. STLDI plans were rolled back to three-month durations under the Obama administration, which is not workable for the many Americans faced with life transitions like changing jobs or taking a year off from school, or for the middle-class families who are ineligible for subsidies but still cannot afford the high costs of Obamacare. The new rules announced by the Trump administration would allow these plans to last for twelve months. Further, under the new rules, STLDI plans can be renewed for up to 36 months, ensuring no American is left without affordable coverage options no matter their life situation or income. In June, the Trump administration also announced expanded access to Association Health Plans. This will allow small businesses and workers to band together to compete in the same way large employers can to negotiate for affordable health coverage for their employees. 
Another thing I’ve long pushed for is transparency in the cost of health care. It’s never made sense to me how the same procedure can have a huge price disparity depending on where it takes place, with little to no transparency. Patients should have the option to shop for the very best care they can afford, and cost information should be readily available for patients and their families as they decide where to seek care. This was a provision I included in my legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare, the American Health Care Reform Act, and I was glad to see President Trump and CMS Administrator Seema Verma announce that hospitals will now be required to post a list of standard prices online beginning January 1, 2019. Americans are the best shoppers in the world; they’ll drive across three lanes of traffic to save five cents off a gallon of gasoline. I know empowering patients with this kind of pricing data will help families shop for care that makes most sense for them.
I’m proud President Trump is working with Republicans in Congress to provide Americans relief from Obamacare while taking action to increase options for coverage and lower costs. As a physician, I came to Congress to help shape the health care debate, and I’ve fought since the day I was sworn in for changes to our health care system that center around the needs of patients while allowing the market to work. It doesn’t mean anything if a patient has an insurance card in their wallet if they can’t afford to use it, and it’s not helpful to hardworking families when premium costs are so high they have to choose between purchasing health insurance for their families and making ends meet. There’s no question we’ve got a lot of work to do to reform our health care system, and I’m still committed to doing that work.   My door is always open to East Tennesseans. Feel free to contact my office if I can be of assistance to you or your family.

8/25/18 9:06,House Republicans Are Protecting Rural America,"￼ 
PROUD TO SERVE MISSISSIPPI’S THIRD DISTRICT 
Dear Friend, 

As another week is coming to an end, I think it is important to continue to discuss the great work that House Republicans are accomplishing here in Washington. This week, I want to highlight our legislative victories for rural America. 

H.R. 2 --Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 - Farm Bill

To provide for the reform and continuation of agricultural and other programs of the Department of Agricul­ture through fiscal year 2023, and for other purposes. The Farm Bill supports the current and long-term devel­opment of rural broadband.

H.J. Res 38 --The Stream Buffer Rule (CRA) (Signed into law)

Repeals a rule that would have saddled mines with unnecessary regulations, putting up to 64% of America's coal reserves off limits and threatening between 40,000 to 70,000 mining jobs.

H.J. Res. 36 --The Bureau of Land Management Venting and Flaring Rule (CRA) (Failed in the Senate) 

Repeals a rule that would further cap methane emissions in the oil and gas industry at a time when the industry is already dramatically reducing emissions, potentially wiping out family-owned marginal wells and costing an estimated $1 billion.

H.J. Res 44 --The Bureau of Land Management Planning 2.0 Rule (CRA) (Signed into law) 

Repeals a rule that would reduce local authority over large swaths of land out west, massively expanding the federal government's control of more than 175 million acres of land-about 4,000 times the size of Washington, D.C. - in 11 western states.

H.R 4986-RAY BAUM'S Act

FCC reauthorization included $600 million for a rural broadband pilot program managed by the U.S. Depart­ment of Agriculture, Rural Utilities Services.

H.R. 8 --Water Resources and Development Act 

H.R. 8 authorizes Army Corps of Engineers civil works activities and builds on previous reform efforts to ensure improvements are made to the nation's ports, inland waterways, locks, dams, flood protection, ecosys­tem restoration, and other water resources infrastructure.

H.R. 23 --Gaining Responsibility on Water Act of 2017 

Works to make more water available to families, farmers, and entire communities in California and bordering Western states.

H.R. 2874-- 21st Century Flood Reform Act 

Reauthorizes the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) for five years, introduces private market competi­tion, and provides programmatic reform to help policyholders.

NDAA Amendment #122 -- Critical Minerals Development 

Facilitates streamlined permitting for critical and strategic minerals.

Farm Bill Amendment #16 --WOTUS repeal 

Would repeal the Obama-era definition of 'navigable waters' under the Clean Water Act that unconstitution­ally expanded the EPA's jurisdiction over transient and insignificant waters, and in a way that was also inconsis­tent with the underlying Clean Water Act.

Farm Bill Amendment #31 --Streamlining the permitting process for rural broadband 

Would streamline and expedite the regulatory framework necessary to utilize federal lands for broadband infrastructure deployment and improve broadband coverage in Rural America.

H.R. 289 -- Guides and Outfitters Act (GO Act) 

Eliminates regulations that inhibit outdoor recreation and increases opportunities for all Americans to access and enjoy the nation's federal lands.

H.R. 2883 -- Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act 

Updates permitting requirements for oil and natural gas pipelines and electric transmission facilities that cross international borders.

H.R.2936 -- Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017 

Expedites forest health projects under the National Environmental Policy Act and improves forest manage­ment activities on public lands and and Tribal lands to return resilience to overgrown, fire-prone forested lands.

H.R. 2910 -- Promoting lnteragency Coordination for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act 

Would specify timeframes and procedures for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and other affected agencies to follow in conducting environmental reviews related to natural gas pipelines.

H.R. 3043 -- Hydropower Policy Modernization Act 

Modernizes the regulatory permitting process and encourages the expansion of hydropower generation by improving administrative efficiency, accountability, and transparency; promotes new hydropower infrastructure; requires balanced and timely decision making; and reduces duplicative oversight.

H.R. 238 -- Commodity End-User Relief Act 

Reauthorizes the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to better protect futures customers, to provide end-users with market certainty, to make basic reforms to ensure transparency and accountability at the Com­mission, to help farmers, ranchers, and end-users manage risks, to help keep consumer costs low, and for other purposes.

H.R. 1238 -- Securing our Agriculture and Food Act (Signed into law) 

Authorizes a program within the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Health Affairs to coordinate efforts to defend U.S. food, agriculture, and veterinary systems against terrorism.

H.R. 1654 -- Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act 

Creates a ""one-stop-shop"" permitting process through the Bureau of Reclamation to streamline the current multi-agency permitting processes for new or expanded non-federal surface storage facilities.

H.R. 1873 --Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act 

Provides streamlined processes for the removal of hazardous vegetative overgrowth within or adjacent to electricity infrastructure on federal lands.

H.R. 3144 -- Dam Protection 

Provides for the continued operations of the four Lower Snake River Dams in the Pacific Northwest through September 30, 2022 in accordance with the best available science and a biological opinion previously approved by the previous Administration. Under the bill, only an act of Congress or a subsequent final biological opinion could cause a departure from current operations or make structural modifications to the four dams addressed by this legislation.

H.R. 4111-- Spurring Business in Communities Act of 2017 

The bill would increase the amount of capital flowing to rural and underserved areas of the country by refo­cusing the SBIC program to focus on forming in these areas.

I hope you enjoyed this legislative overview. Mississippians certainly have a number of legislative victories to celebrate!

Stay tuned for future updates on our legislative effort to build safe and strong communities. 

God Bless,

￼ 
DEMANDING ANSWERS FOR CANCER PATIENTS
￼ 
Lindsey - 
The families of dozens of people in St. Lucie County impacted by brain cancer deserve answers. That’s why I’m demanding accountability and transparency from the Department of Health and Human Services about why they haven’t implemented a law that could help. 
Trevor’s Law was passed in 2016 to investigate potential cancer clusters. But 2 years later, the failure to implement this law has real word consequences for these families and cannot be allowed to continue. 
That's why I'm demanding an exact record of progress that has been made toward implementation and urging HHS to expedite implementation of this law. I’ve also inviting HHS Secretary Alex Azar to sit down with families in St. Lucie County that have been impacted by brain cancer personally.

Fighting for our Great Lakes  



Friend,
Welcome to your weekly update. As always, you can learn more about these and other legislative issues at my website: upton.house.gov. 
Fighting for our Great Lakes
Growing up on the shores of Lake Michigan has instilled in me a deep appreciation for our wildlife and natural resources. Last month, I was proud to join with my colleagues in voting to fully fund the critical Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI). The GLRI helps us strengthen and preserve our Great Lakes environment and helps keep our Southwest Michigan economy and tourism industry booming.
We had to fight for this full funding as some wanted it nearly-eliminated. Not on our watch.
Some other wins we’ve chalked up for the Great Lakes in recent years include banning plastic microbead pollutants, securing needed funding for commercial and industrial harbor dredging, keeping nuclear waste off the shores of our lakes, and ensuring increased safety and oversight on pipelines including the Line 5 pipeline.
Learn more about my extensive, bipartisan record of fighting for our Great Lakes so we can preserve their beauty for future generations by clicking here.
Affordable housing grant coming to Portage
On Thursday, I helped announce a new Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) for the City of Portage. The grant, allocated from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, is worth $237,119 and is to be used for housing assistance programs and more
Simply put: This grant will help improve lives right here at home. Affordable housing is critical for families looking to put down roots in our region and we’re all looking forward to seeing the grant in action and the positive impact it will have on community pride.
Learn more by clicking here.
Parchment update 
I was back in Parchment Thursday night passing out water to those that still need it. Some good news: The latest test results show the amount of PFAS in Parchment has dropped. More testing is coming so please follow Kalamazoo County Health & Community Services for the latest. 
In the meantime, the water distribution center is open on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays from 2:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. at Haven Reformed Church. The Parchment water hotline is still: 269-373-5346. 
On the road again…
It’s been another busy, and fun, week here at home meeting with constituents of all stripes. I attended the Women’s Equality Luncheon in Kalamazoo, visited with employees at Zoetis in Kalamazoo, met with Ducks Unlimited in Fennville, discussed health care issues with constituents in Kalamazoo, gave a quick legislative update to the Lions Club in Benton Harbor, was on-hand for a ribbon cutting ceremony for a new McDonald’s restaurant in Oshtemo Township, talked with employees at Thermo Fisher in Portage, helped pass out water in Parchment, and much more.
You can always stay up-to-date with what I’m up to back home by following my Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter pages.
Have a great weekend and God bless,
-Fred

8/25/18 9:01,Opioid Roundtable,"News from Representative Crawford 
￼ 
￼   ￼   ￼   ￼   ￼   ￼   
￼
Opioid Roundtable 
With Congress out of session for August, I've had another week of productive meetings with folks in the district. One of these meetings included a roundtable with local leaders involved in healthcare, law enforcement, and education about how the opioid epidemic is directly effecting the 1st district. 

It was incredibly helpful to get many perspectives on the new ways they are seeing opioid abuse spread through their respective fields. All attendees brought positive feedback to the discussion and were in agreement that having multiple people from different counties is a step in the right direction. I appreciate their time and willingness to work together to combat this large epidemic facing the 1st district and I'm optimistic their insight will be useful to better address opioid addiction in Congress. 
 
￼
 
As we in Congress work at effectively ending the epidemic I wanted to let you folks know about the resources available to you: 

A list of recovery centers can be found here.

and a map of prescription drug collection sites can be found here.

FAQ (What folks have been calling/texting my office about this week)
Q: I have a lot of concerns about the new Hours of Service regulations that have been implemented. What is the Congressman doing to help with this?
A: Hours of Service is something that continues to show needs for reform. Truckers play a huge role in not only the movement of goods across the nation, but in the agriculture as well. Not only have I introduced legislation to help provide some more flexibility in some of the regulations but I've also been in contact with the Department of Transportation about some of these concerns. The Secretary has been very receptive of these concerns and just this week they announced an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) that outlines a framework to provide our trucking industry with flexibility within Hours of Service (HOS) regulation. I hope to work together to achieve our mutual goal of efficient movement of goods as well as safer roads and highways.

Campaigns & Elections
Weighing alternatives to Facebook for advocacy
When a four-term congressman deletes his Facebook page to explore an alternative technology for receiving and acting upon constituent feedback, it catches our attention.
Now, it could be said that Arkansas Rep. Rick Crawford (R) was jumping on the #deletefacebook bandwagon in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. But his decision to leave the platform was still significant.

Cotton, Boozman, and Crawford Applaud Iraqi Purchase of U.S. Rice

Senators John Boozman and Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) and Congressman Rick Crawford (R-Arkansas) today applauded the news that Iraq will buy 30,000 metric tons of rice from the United States.

'As an advocate for new and friendly trade partnerships, I am pleased to see the U.S. reach a rice tender with Iraq. This new market creates more opportunity for our Arkansas farmers and I appreciate the large effort put into making this deal happen,' said Crawford

Grant will allow for 3 firefighters in Jonesboro
The Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response grant will have to be approved by City Council. It reimburses the City for 75 percent of the new employees’ pay in their first two years, and 35 percent in the third. The City has six months to make the hires, and Miller said each new firefighter will require six months to a year of training.
Perrin praised the City’s Community Development Director Tiffny Calloway and Miller for winning the grant, and offered thanks for a support letter from U.S. Congressman Rick Crawford.

McKinley Applauds Release of Affordable Clean Energy Rule 
On Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency released the Affordable Clean Energy Rule that replaces the Obama Administration’s harmful Clean Power Plan, which the Trump Administration repealed in last year. 

President Trump is keeping his promise to revitalize the coal industry. One of his first actions in office was to roll back the Obama Administration’s regulations on power plants that were an unconstitutional, bureaucratic and ideologically-driven assault designed to kill coal.

Under President Trump’s leadership, we are taking a different path that promotes American energy dominance and innovation that allows us to use our abundant resources cleaner than ever before. Rather than overstepping its role, the government will work with the states and give them the flexibility to set standards. And the government will no longer pick winners and losers in an attempt to set America’s energy policy.

DOJ & DEA Seek to Reduce Manufacturing of Opioids
Recently, the Department of Justice and the Drug Enforcement Agency announced a proposed effort to reduce the amount of opioids manufactured in the U.S. next year. We have been saying for years that this was the correct course of action and we're encouraged to see the Trump Administration taking this critical step.

McKinley Holds Round Table with the Mid-Ohio Valley Regional Council
This week, we held a round table with the Mid-Ohio Valley Regional Council. There was some great discussion that highlighted the need to invest in our infrastructure, continue promoting workforce development programs, and we discussed ways to boost economic development in the region. 
￼

McKinley Meets with the Academy Programs of Fairmont
This week, we visited the Academy Programs of Fairmont. Founded in 2002, this organization provides excellent behavioral and substance abuse services for at-risk youth. We talked about the House’s recent legislation to provide greater resources to combat the opioid epidemic, and our success in securing a five-fold increase to the level of funding that West Virginia receives. 
￼

McKinley Speaks at the Morgantown Chamber of Commerce Breakfast
On Monday, it was great to join the Morgantown Chamber of Commerce for breakfast, and to give a legislative update on our work in Washington. From infrastructure to workforce development to opioids, there was a lot of good discussion.

Foxx Report
  
This Congress, House Republicans have been productive in fulfilling our promises to the American people, and this month's district work period has been no different.  As your elected representative in Congress, I have been traveling around North Carolina's beautiful 5th District meeting with businesses, universities, non-profits, and local organizations to hear their stories of success and the challenges they are facing to effectively serve them in Washington.   Constituents have also visited me in my Boone and Clemmons offices to bring a variety of issues to my attention, including recent scams targeting senior citizens.  One man brought in a whole box full of scam mail that his mother received, and my office has alerted the Federal Trade Commission to these attempts at fraud.  This is a reminder to all of us that if you think you see a scam, it is important to report it to the Federal Trade Commission at ftc.gov/complaint.  The North Carolina Attorney General also collects information on consumer complaints here. 
￼

    Looking through scam mail with Brionna Miller, who is interning in my Clemmons office this semester

One theme from my visits throughout the district is that after the nearly two years of a unified Republican federal government, North Carolinians are Better Off Now.  Small businesses are thriving thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the 16 Congressional Review Act Resolutions reducing regulations signed into law this Congress.  People are returning to work with the 3.7 million new jobs that have been added to the country's economy since November.  Communities are tackling the opioid scourge with new resources.  High-skilled manufacturers and numerous other industries are praising the bipartisan Strengthening Career and Technical Education Act that became law last month to close the workforce skills gap.  Not least of all, we are also rebuilding our military and ensuring that the over 750,000 veterans in the 5th District receive the care and benefits they deserve. 

Here are just some of the highlights from district events and site visits so far.

On my weekly ""Capitol Hill Report,"" I spoke with Dennis Morrice of KLEM Radio in Le Mars and Dale Wagner of the Sac Sun in Sac City about trade, security clearances and Iowa's low unemployment rate. 
Q&A: Border Security
Q. Why did you write a letter to the Department of Homeland Security asking how the man accused of murdering Mollie Tibbetts got from Mexico to Iowa and was in Iowa illegally for up to seven years? Q. How do Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) protect our borders? 
Quick Links
The Senate passed a bipartisan amendment I introduced with Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois that will help to empower patients, promote transparency and lower prescription drug costs. Bringing transparency to drug pricing and educating the public about the cost of their prescriptions is common sense. We’re building on what the pharmaceutical industry is already doing. In their ads, these companies educate consumers on new drugs and their side effects. This bill goes one step further by educating the public on pricing. This is long overdue and will be a great service to health care consumers throughout the country.
The Senate Judiciary Committee, which I chair, has received more than 430,700 pages of executive branch materials for Judge Brett Kavanaugh. That is more than double the previous record of 180,000 pages set during Justice Gorsuch’s nomination. I’m proud to preside over what will be the most transparent confirmation process in history and I look forward to Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings beginning on September 4. 
Over the course of my public service, I’ve found sunshine to be the most effective way to promote transparency and accountability in the federal government. That’s why congressional oversight is so important, and why it’s been a centerpiece of my work as a U.S. senator. Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have joined my oversight efforts. Government oversight is a key ingredient to changing the federal bureaucratic culture. The health, safety and livelihoods of the American people depend on it.
Omar Abdulsattar Ameen, an Iraqi national and alleged member of Al Qaeda and ISIS who is living in the United States as a refugee, was recently arrested in California. I'm seeking Ameen’s full immigration history, any security vetting documentation related to Ameen’s entry into the United States and Ameen’s visa application history. We need to better understand how someone with ties to terrorism and wanted for murder could possibly be granted refugee status and allowed to enter American communities.
Every instance of a missing child is a tragedy and we cannot let up on our fight against child abduction and exploitation. That's why I joined Senators Dianne Feinstein of California, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Rob Portman of Ohio and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota in introducing the bipartisan Missing Children’s Assistance Act of 2018. The bill would reauthorize the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and continue the fight against child abduction and exploitation. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children helps families, caregivers, schools and communities prevent the exploitation of children and aid in their recovery. This is an important bill to support and modernize that work.

Thirty-Seven Days Until Land and Water Conservation Fund Expires; Sen. Burr, “I Won’t Allow That to Happen…”
 
 
This week, I returned to the Senate floor to continue my fight to reauthorize America’s most successful conservation program, the Land and Water Conservation Fund. We are 37 days away from the program’s expiration, and I’m more committed than ever to renew this vital fund that does so much to protect and maintain some of America’s most beautiful national treasures – at absolutely no cost to the taxpayers. 
 
You might remember that in July I offered an amendment to reauthorize LWCF. While that effort was unsuccessful, I offered my colleagues two more bipartisan compromises this week. Although nearly all of my colleagues profess to support this program, they again refused to take up the issue. I promise all my fellow Senators and Representatives this: if I have to come down to the Senate floor morning and afternoon, day after day after day, I’ll do it. I’ve got enough iterations of the bill that I can accommodate anybody’s concerns and find a way to get permanent authorization.
 
￼
WATCH: Senator Burr Speaks on the LWCF on Senate Floor
 
In 2015, it took LWCF’s expiration before Congress got serious about reauthorizing the program and allowing these vital conservation efforts to continue. We must act now because the next generation deserves to grow up in the same beautiful North Carolina that we enjoyed so much. 37 days until the Land and Water Conservation Fund expires –  rest assured, I will not allow that to happen again.

This Week in Review
￼￼￼
 
Hello Friends, 

I had yet another great week of meeting with groups in Arizona. This week I had the chance to meet with Proctorio, a startup based in Scottsdale for Startup Week Across America. While most might think of Silicon Valley as the hub for innovators, in Arizona, we are blessed to have entrepreneurs that are consistently creating jobs in our own backyard. Thank you, Proctorio, for your time! 


￼￼

Photo on the left: I served as a panel moderator at the ASU Congressional Conference on Space and Innovation. Arizona continues to have a large footprint on the space ""world"" and it was great to hear from experts about how to stay ahead of the curve
Photo to the right: I joined the Jewish National Foundation to discuss the Gaza Border Crisis. It was inspiring to hear the personal stories from residents of the Border to discuss such a critical issue in the world, and I thank the foundation for inviting me to join the conversation. 

￼

To wrap up this week I met with employees at the FAA Phoenix Terminal Radar Approach Control Tower at Sky Harbor Airport. During our visit, they showed me what it is like being an air traffic controller and we discussed policies that impact their work. I appreciate the time they spent with me and I thank them for their vigilance in keeping our skies safe!
Russia and the United States' Relationship
Many constituents have asked me about Russia in the past few weeks, so I wanted to share a bit on the Russia and the United States' Relationship  I am proud to have supported the Magnitsky Act during the 112th Congress. This law originally banned 18 Russian government officials and businessmen from entering the United States, froze all their U.S. assets, and barred them from using the U.S. banking system in the future, thus freezing them from out of the global banking system.
This was despite the Obama Administration’s strong opposition to the enactment of this law, for fear of angering the Russian government during their ill-fated attempt at ‘resetting’ the U.S.-Russian relationship . President Obama held this legislation hostage under threat of veto for many months, and his colleague then Senator John Kerry tried to delay this legislation as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee.  Eventually, public pressure and bipartisan support won the day and the Magnitsky Act became law, despite President Obama and then Senator John Kerry’s ardent opposition.
In 2016, a global version of the Magnitsky Act was expanded to human rights abusers around the world, and many countries have now followed with their own legislation modeled closely after the original Magnitsky Act. I was an original cosponsor of the global Magnitsky Act and helped to get broad support for this legislation. According to the Treasury Department, since January 2017 over 460 human rights abusers from Russia, Burma, South Sudan, Nicaragua and many other countries have been added to Treasury sanctions programs due to direct actions by those individuals  involved in perpetuating human rights abuses or corruption.

A Week in Photos: Working for You
As Congress gets ready to return in September, I want to reaffirm my commitment to being your voice for the 6th District of Georgia. There has already been a tremendous amount of forward progress in fostering economic security, making our communities safer, and protecting our country here at home and around the world. 
This month has been very busy but incredible. After meeting with so many of you, one message is loud and clear – tax cuts are working for you and your family. Wages are increasing (up nearly 3%), millions of jobs have been created, and businesses across the country are benefiting – investment is up nearly $600 million! 
Throughout the week, I visited many businesses and met with several constituents. If you have a few moments, check out some of the highlights below. 
￼ 
I had a great time in Alpharetta with Delta Dental at a town hall. I received a lot of good feedback about how Washington can work better for you and your family. 
  ￼ 
The East Cobb Rotary is fired up about tax reform! The average family of four is seeing tax cuts of more than $4,400. 
 ￼ 
HUD Secretary Ben Carson came to Roswell to tour the Veranda at Groveway to see affordable housing options in Georgia. 
   ￼ 
It was incredible to tour Honda and meet with employees. The automotive industry – suppliers, automakers, and dealers – have a big impact on the 6th District economy. 
  
￼ 
There is nothing quite like an ice-cold Coke on a hot summer day. Thank you to Coca-Cola for having me to your bottling facility in Sandy Springs.

U.S. Dept. of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue Visits Upstate New York
It was a pleasure to have U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue in Columbia County to visit two local farms. Upstate New York is home to some of the hardest working farmers in America whose high-quality products feed the region and the rest of the country.
Secretary Perdue and I discussed prospective changes to farm labor programs, and we also sat down with local dairy farmers to discuss how we can create policies that better serve them and their farming operations. It is critical that we address the shrinking dairy market and identify how to shift the headwinds that are affecting Upstate Dairy Farmers to tailwinds.
Thank you to the Secretary for coming to Upstate New York to hear directly from our local farmers. A thank you also must go out to Altobelli Family Farm and Dutch Hollow Farm for not only hosting the Secretary, but also taking the time to educate him on the fantastic work being done here.  
There are more pictures at the bottom of this newsletter and available to share on Facebook by clicking here.

Solutions to Shortcomings in the Farm-Labor Program
Farms across Upstate New York have faced challenges maintaining a consistent and reliable workforce. Many of the Upstate producers that I have visited, along with members of my Ag. Advisory Committee, have relayed their concerns over the insufficiencies of the current H-2A worker program that hamstrings their production. In fact, it’s an issue Secretary Perdue and I heard a lot about during our visit to Altobelli Family Farm in Columbia County this week.
After hearing these concerns, I helped develop and co-sponsored H.R. 6417 – the Ag and Legal Workforce Act, which will create a new agricultural guest worker program (H-2C) to ensure Upstate farmers have the ability to maintain a reliable workforce. The overhaul contained in this bill is supported by dozens of Ag. Stakeholders in New York and nationwide. Notably, the overhaul would allow dairy farmers to gain access to the guest worker program. I am hopeful that Congress will act quickly to help our farmers. In addition, it would require all U.S. employers to use E-Verify, a web-based program that would help ensure workers are legal and their documents are valid.

IRS Rules on State and Local Tax Deduction
On Thursday, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued guidance disallowing state tax changes approved by the State of New York and numerous other states to convert some state and local tax payments to payments that might be eligible for the charitable tax deduction under federal law.
The partial elimination of the state and local tax deduction was the primary reason I voted against the tax bill. Due to numerous questions from constituents and tax professionals, I asked for the IRS to clarify the treatment of proposed workarounds enacted in Albany. That's my job as a Member of Congress. Taxpayers deserve to know how the IRS would treat these workarounds, and merely hoping that the IRS would approve the Cuomo plan was not a responsible stance. Now that the IRS has ruled, the State of New York needs to get to work reducing our high tax burden.
Read the letters I sent to the IRS by clicking here: https://faso.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1239

The USS Pueblo is not a War Trophy, It Must be Returned
Based on the input that I received from the members of my Veterans Advisory Committee, this week, I sent a letter to U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton urging the administration to secure the return of the USS Pueblo in any nuclear deal with North Korea. In 1968, the USS Pueblo was intercepted by a North Korean patrol boat. The North Koreans assaulted the American intelligence vessel in international waters, which resulted in the death of U.S. Navy sailor Duane Hodges.  After their ship was captured and led to a North Korean port, the American crew members endured eleven months of physical and psychological torture before returning to the United States.
The USS Pueblo remains a U.S. Navy commissioned vessel, but it is currently being used as a museum and war trophy for the North Korean regime. Bringing it home would help provide closure to the heroes who wrongly suffered at hands of North Korea and their surviving family members.
Read the full letter here: https://faso.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1238

Showing Support for our Nation’s Heroes
Vet2Vet is a veteran’s services program under the umbrella of Mental Health America of Dutchess County that offers a resource office, social activities, and support groups to help local veterans who may be struggling with addiction, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Traumatic Brain Injury, or other mental health issues. On Saturday, I had the pleasure of attending a picnic they hosted to thank and show support for our nation’s heroes.
Our local veterans have played a vital role in defending our liberties and building our communities. I am grateful for programs such as Vet2Vet that provides important services from veterans to veterans and their families.

Synthetic Drugs Emerge to the Forefront of the Opioid Crisis
Just a couple grains — less than a pinch of salt even — can pretty much seal your fate.” This is how law enforcement approaches synthetic drugs such as fentanyl when it’s found on the street. Fentanyl is created in a lab, much of the time overseas, and can be fifty times more potent than heroin.
The United States Department of Justice recently announced indictments for two nefarious fentanyl producers in China who have exploited U.S. mail to flood American communities with synthetic drugs. Fentanyl is attributed to have caused 30,000 overdose deaths in 2017—twice as many as heroin, prescription opioids, and cocaine. 
We must stop synthetic drugs such as fentanyl and its even stronger alternative carfentanil before they reach our communities. The STOP Act will strengthen enforcement by giving border agents the tools needed to identify and confiscate packages containing these synthetic opioids when they come into the country through international mail.
I’ve been a leading proponent of this bill and am proud of the progress we’ve made to construct a bipartisan and bicameral solution. I’m looking forward to it passing the Senate and being signed into law. The American people deserve no less.

""Signs of Arrogance""
Originally posted in the Watertown Daily Times, this editorial details the ridiculous behavior by the Cuomo administration in seemingly refusing to take down illegal highway signs that will cost the state of New York $14 million in federal funding. The state said in February that it would be taking down the signs to avoid that unfortunate outcome. However, to this date, nothing has been completed.
It’s time for Albany to get serious about using taxpayer dollars efficiently, and prioritizing infrastructure projects that are effective and budget conscious. Our state needs these funds and allowing them to be wasted for political reasons is unacceptable.

Preserving Upstate Revolutionary War History
The National Park Service’s American Battlefield Protection Program is a critically important program that promotes the conservation of our nation’s historic battlefields. The NPS recently announced that, through the American Battlefield Protection Program, federal funding has been awarded to the Fort Plain Museum in Montgomery County for research, documentation, and planning for a project related to the Battle of Stone Arabia fought during the American Revolution.
Last December, I wrote a letter to Empire State Development to support the museum’s proposal. The Fort Plain Museum’s project is an exciting proposal to enshrine history from our nation’s founding struggle so that future generations may know the bravery and courage of Americans who fought in the Revolutionary War. New York was home to many critical battles during the American Revolution, and I’m excited to see more Revolutionary history highlighted.

Bake-off to Stock the Stephentown Food Pantry
The Stephentown Day Bake-off and Sale is held as part of the annual Celebrate Stephentown Festival. Proceeds from the sale benefit the Stephentown Food Pantry.
I had the pleasure of serving as one of the judges for the bake-off. All the entries were delicious, and I can say the sheer amount of desserts spoiled my dinner for the night. Thank you to the volunteers who put on the Festival and all the entrants who baked for the competition and for the sale.

Upstate New York’s Storied History as the Nation’s Knife Producer
The Wawarsing Historical Society and Knife Museum was built to preserve the rich history of knife-making in the Hudson Valley. It was great to tour the facility and learn more about the crucial role that the region played in crafting a large portion of the knives Americans used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Agricultural Advisory Committee Forum at the Dutchess County Fair
On Thursday, I attended the fourth annual Agricultural Advisory Committee Forum at the Dutchess County Fair. The Dutchess County Fair is the largest six-day county fair in all of New York State, and brings together members of the community for six days of food, fun, and entertainment, and highlights the county’s rich and dynamic agriculture community and its many local vendors.
Agriculture is the engine of the Dutchess County economy, and it is imperative that we stay in-touch with local stake holders and farmers to identify programs and solutions to strengthen the farming industry for future generations. At the forum, we discussed the implementation of the Dutchess County Agricultural and Farmland Protection Plan as well as the Partnership for Manageable Growth. I also had the opportunity to listen to a presentation by members of the Harlem Valley Food Alliance on the state of agriculture in Dutchess County.
This meeting was extremely informative and brought together key members of Dutchess County’s agriculture community. I want to thank Dutchess County Executive Marcus Molinaro and the Agricultural Advisory Committee for hosting this forum, and the other local officials, State Senator Sue Serino and County Legislator Gregg Pulver, who participated.  Preventing further decline of the county’s agriculture sector will require a team effort, and I am encouraged by the innovation and forward thinking of Dutchess County’s farming community.

Dear Lindsey, 
It was great to join the League of Conservation Voters, the Appalachian Mountain Club and the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests at Plymouth State University yesterday to celebrate the centennial of the White Mountain National Forest and discuss the importance of reauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). I’m a proud cosponsor of a bipartisan bill that will permanently reauthorize LWCF, which has been critical in preserving our environment. New Hampshire’s outdoor recreation industry generates $8.7 billion in consumer spending every year and supports 79,000 Granite State jobs, so conservation efforts are about protecting our environment and economy.

Protecting public health and our economy 
That’s why I’m outraged over President Trump’s decision to roll back the Clean Power Plan this week. Instead of looking out for the well-being of Granite Staters and the American people, the President made a choice that will benefit a few large corporate special interests. I will continue to push back on this misguided move and work to defend our environment in New Hampshire to protect public health and our economy. 
Taking care of New Hampshire's seniors 
Yesterday I had the opportunity to visit the new Summit by Morrison senior living community in Whitefield and meet with staff. I was impressed with the variety of housing options Summit has for seniors who want to move to or continue living in the North Country. Ensuring seniors in this part of New Hampshire have access to affordable and quality living communities that meet their needs is critical to the well-being of North Country seniors and their families.

Combating the North Country's substance abuse crisis 
I also got to tour the new and expanded Friendship House Residential Treatment Center in Bethlehem yesterday and see its capacity to help people reclaim their lives from addiction. I was proud to write in support of funding through the Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC) for the construction of this 32-bed facility to help expand services at Friendship House, the North Country’s only short-term residential and outpatient treatment program. I’ll continue advocating for funding that will bring much-needed services to address the substance abuse crisis in the North Country.

Ensuring every Granite Stater has stable housing 
I was excited to take part in the ribbon cutting ceremony for the newly renovated Brookside Park low-income apartments in Berlin this morning. Affordable housing is critical for communities and our economy in New Hampshire. I will keep working to ensure everyone who lives in the Granite State has the comfort and confidence that comes with stable housing.

See below for highlights of my week fighting for the priorities of Granite Staters.

This Week: Follow Granite Staters’ Health Care Stories on My Instagram

Every Granite Stater and American deserves quality, affordable health care. It’s as simple as that. But unfortunately, since I came to the Senate, we have had to fend off repeated attacks on Americans’ health and well-being. 
 ￼ 
Last summer, we defeated legislation that would’ve gutted protections for people with pre-existing conditions because the American people came together, shared their most personal health care stories, and made clear that we would not stand for these attacks. 
That fight isn't over. The Trump Administration's efforts to undermine protections for pre-existing conditions, sabotage our health care system, and raise costs for consumers have not stopped – and it’s critical that we continue to speak out.  
I’ll be sharing the stories of Granite Staters who know first-hand how much is at stake in this fight on my Instagram, @senatorhassan. I hope you’ll follow along.  
This week, the Senate passed a bipartisan funding bill for FY2019 to help bolster national security, and invest in critical New Hampshire priorities, including combating the devastating opioid epidemic, strengthening workforce training, protecting women’s health care, and more.  
Working across party lines, we were able to secure a significant increase in federal funding for New Hampshire to combat the opioid crisis for the remainder of this fiscal year, and this bill will help ensure that this funding increase continues next year. While this additional funding is a critical next step to help those struggling with substance use disorder get treatment, we know that this fight is far from over. I’ll keep working every day to strengthen prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts and to ensure that those on the front lines of this crisis have the support they need to help save lives.
Read more here. 
President Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was found guilty this week of eight felonies and the President’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to eight separate felonies.  
President Trump’s closest circle of advisors, including his campaign chairman, personal lawyer, White House National Security Advisor, deputy campaign chair, and campaign advisor have all either pleaded guilty or been found guilty of serious criminal charges in a court of law. The president's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, went so far as to state – under oath – that his actions were at the direction of the candidate. President Trump needs to answer for his involvement.
A clear pattern of criminality continues to emerge. Now more than ever, the ongoing investigations regarding President Trump and his associates must be allowed to continue without any interference from the President or his administration. I continue to urge Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and my colleagues to have the courage to put country before party by immediately taking up and passing legislation to protect the Special Counsel. 
Given the news of criminal acts committed by the President’s closest advisors, it is more important than ever that we have access to all of Judge Kavanaugh’s records, especially those relating to the checks on the President’s power. Until then, his hearings should not move forward. 
There continue to be extremely high levels of PFAS contamination in the Merrimack area. 
Our people deserve safe, clean drinking water. I joined the rest of the Congressional Delegation in sending a letter to the director of the agency in charge of toxic chemicals, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), asking him to take additional steps to assess the contamination in Merrimack. Read more here. 
￼ 
This week, the Trump Administration repealed the Clean Power Plan, putting people’s health in danger and undermining efforts to restrict greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.   
In New Hampshire, we've long been working to ensure that our people can breathe clean air – requiring power plants to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and increasing our use of clean, renewable energy.  
Read my Medium post on how the Trump Administration is reversing the progress we have made and giving his friends in the fossil fuel industry free rein to pollute the air our children breath.  You can read it here.  
This week, I was proud to recognize Positive Street Art as the August Granite Staters of the Month for their work to remember those lost to substance use disorders and support those seeking recovery in Nashua. 
￼ 
When completed, Positive Street Art's new ""Take Courage"" mural will bear an important and hopeful message for people in Nashua and across the Granite State who have been impacted by the horrific opioid crisis: “Take Courage. When the road is long you must never forget you are never alone.”

A Culture of Corruption


￼
A Cesspool of Self-Enrichment, Secret Money and Ethical Blindness 
Tuesday’s guilty verdicts against President Trump’s campaign chairman Paul Manafort on multiple felony charges of tax and bank fraud and the guilty plea of Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen of tax fraud, bank fraud and campaign finance violations are evidence of the rampant corruption and criminality at the heart of Trump’s inner circle.  The indictment of San Diego Congressman Duncan Hunter on charges related to the falsification of campaign finance records and the misuse of campaign funds are further proof of the culture of corruption in Washington.   
Every day, the American people are confronted with a GOP Congress and Administration that has taken every opportunity to stack the deck for the wealthy and well-connected against hard-working families.  Republicans have turned Washington into a cesspool of self-enrichment, secret money and ethical blindness, as evidenced by the recent indictments of President Trump’s first two supporters in Congress, Congressman Collins and Congressman Hunter.  Speaker Ryan must affirm that no one is above the law and immediately call on Congressman Hunter to resign. 
The American people deserve better than the corruption, cronyism and incompetence of the dysfunctional political system in Washington.  Democrats are committed to fighting For The People to clean up corruption and give power back to the people.

Therefore, my office wrote a Non-Immigrant Visa Letter of Support for his father. As a result, the Non-Immigrant visa was granted, allowing him to attend his son’s wedding. To celebrate this happy occasion, my office sent a congratulatory note to the newlywed couple.

Focusing on career and technical education
￼
Rep. Lewis hosts career and technical education Roundtable in Burnsville.


Dear Lindsey,
This summer I’ve had the opportunity to meet with various groups of Second District residents, business owners, and community leaders to discuss the issues near and dear to your hearts. 
Just recently in Burnsville I held a Roundtable that focused on the importance of Career and Technical Education (CTE) to Minnesotan students, young people, and businesses. 
Two-year technical degrees are a viable alternative to four-year universities, and prepare students to enter a modern 21st Century workforce. CTE programs allow students to get real-world experience in skilled trades that employers are looking for. Almost half of talent recruiters at Fortune 1000 companies report trouble finding qualified candidates with 2-year STEM degrees, and about 50 percent of all STEM jobs are open to workers with less than a bachelor’s degree.
There is a skills gap in America that CTE programs can help fill, and it was great to come together with local business owners and community members who resonate and support the work being done to increase access to this kind of training, and some of which offer CTE themselves to workers and students in the metro area. 
To that same end, the President recently signed the Strengthening Career and Technical Education (CTE) Act into law, which included my language to support dual and concurrent enrollment so that high school students can take classes at technical colleges for credit, and get a head start in their chosen field. 
I’m proud to support CTE programming in our schools so students can have the opportunity to try their hand at a skilled trade, and potentially find a career path that works for them.
As I work on this and other issues, I always like to hear directly from you.  Please share any thoughts you may have through my website, and sign up for my e-mail newsletter for the latest updates from Washington, D.C. and around the district. You can also stay on top of my work by following my Facebook and Twitter pages. Please feel free to call my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-2271 or my local Burnsville office at 651-846-2120 with any comments or for assistance with a federal agency.

Sincerely, 
￼

WEEK IN REVIEW
￼
To start off this week's From the Front... I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nation’s capital, including Larry and Vicki Thomas from Bentonville, the Barker family from Fayetteville, and Stewart Ong from Bentonville. Safe travels back to the Natural State.
This week, I wrapped up my town hall tour of the Third District, hosting town halls in Russellville on Monday and Bella Vista on Wednesday. Topics of discussion included healthcare, social security, border security, immigration reform, concerns with the medical care our veterans receive, and the need to have a robust military in a world where both state and non-state actors are active in their opposition to the United States. I also discussed my job as Chairman of the House Budget Committee, where we have passed through Committee our Budget for a Brighter American Future, and my role as co-chair of the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform. I believe it is important for my constituents to have a forum to speak with me, and it is equally important that I have a chance to connect with you. I was pleased to know that so many people felt it was their civic duty to come out and join me. I want to thank all of the constituents of the Third District for coming out to my town halls!
￼
I began my week traveling to Russellville to tour JW Aluminum. JW Aluminum is the leading aluminum rolled products company in the world. This is the newest JW Aluminum plant and services consumer durables, containers and packaging, and general distribution markets. I met with employees and discussed trade, tax cuts, the local work force, national debt, and social security. One employee I met, Josefina Arevalo, just recently became an American citizen. Congratulations, Josefina!
I then met with the Russellville Chamber where I updated them on recent legislation in Washington, along with the progress of the Joint Select Committee. The Joint Select Committee has been tasked with reforming our flawed budget and appropriations process and shares the common goal of having an effective federal budgeting process. As we determine fixes, it is my hope that we recommend a framework that works regardless of who holds the majority.
￼
Before I hosted my town hall Event, I toured Arkansas Tech University’s new Multi-Sport Athletic Complex. The $3.86 million complex provides indoor practice space for the intercollegiate baseball, softball, tennis, and men’s and women’s golf programs, as well as locker rooms, office space, a training room, and a conference room. This will be a great addition for the success of the school’s student-athletes and sports programs!
On Tuesday morning, I visited the Teen Challenge Ranch, which is a Christian therapeutic boarding school dedicated to helping troubled boys get a new start in life. Teen Challenge Ranch helps at-risk boys who struggle with behavioral issues, such as anger, defiance, attention deficit disorder, drug or alcohol abuse, trouble with the law, dangerous activities, or disrespect for authority. The therapeutic program offers hope and an opportunity for a new, more productive future. I am happy to have visited. 
￼
My next stop was the Prairie Grove Senior Center. The senior center provides regularly scheduled transportation for seniors who no longer drive, as well as home-delivered meals. The senior center is a great place for seniors to meet new friends, have a nutritious lunch, or join in exercise and computer classes. I gave an update on current legislative business and answered a few of their questions. I ended my Tuesday meeting with Farmington City Officials and touring the new City Hall complex with Farmington Mayor Ernie Penn. Thank you for inviting me to stop by!
￼
On Wednesday, I visited the newly completed Intermediate School in Gentry. Visiting schools throughout the Third District fills me with great confidence in the future of our country, and the Intermediate School is no exception. What an impressive group of kids! I then toured the construction site for the future Simmons Poultry Production Plant to be completed by late 2019. This facility will employ over 3,000 workers, making it currently the biggest job creation project in Northwest Arkansas! I look forward to its completion. 
I spent Thursday in Siloam Springs partaking in a tour of the small businesses in downtown Siloam Springs. I sat down with local business owners to talk about current legislation in the House, as well as the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We talked about how their businesses have been benefiting from tax reform. I then walked down Main Street and stopped in some local shops, including Blogs for Brands, Heather Hill Clothing, Feemster Building, and City Barber Shop, the oldest barber shop in Arkansas. Main Street businesses are the backbone of our communities. They contribute to local economies and bringing growth and innovation. I encourage you all to shop local and show your support!
￼
On Friday, I hosted Coffee with the Congressman in Van Buren. I host these coffee events in small towns across the Third District to provide an opportunity for constituents outside of the four biggest population centers to meet with me in an informal setting. Thanks for the great conversation! I believe it is important as their elected representative to provide my constituents with the opportunity for civil, meaningful, and substantive dialogue. I encourage those who reside in Arkansas's Third District to monitor my website and social media platforms for future announcements notifying the public when these events will occur. 
￼
I then traveled to the Arkansas Valley Electric office to tour their new high efficiency office. This is the first solar array for Arkansas Valley Electric, which is intended to reduce peak demand electricity costs and provide a testing ground for future solar projects. The field of solar panels can produce enough electricity to power 75 homes. Thank you for taking time to meet with me and tour me around the new office! 
I ended my Friday stopping by Stepping Stones Jobs Plus Adult Development Center. Jobs Plus, the vocational division of Stepping Stone was started to meet the  growing need of adults with developmental disabilities to be trained and make a positive contribution to our community. The goal is to help these individuals become as independent as possible while also helping build their self-esteem by achieving gainful employment. Jobs Plus brings in contract work opportunities from many varying industries in the community. Their recent expansion includes health and fitness classes and academic instruction in areas such as budgeting, financing, and reading skills. The facility was awarded a 2017 Giving Tree Grant from the Arkansas Community Foundation to help fund the project. I am impressed at all they have done for our community—thank you for letting me stop by!

POLICY UPDATE: CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION
As I travel throughout the Third District, one of the major challenges businesses bring to my attention is finding properly trained employees for high-skilled, well-paying, technical jobs. These conversations have highlighted for me how serious of a problem the skills gap is for our district and state, and that a sustainable solution requires a fundamental shift in how we as a nation perceive postsecondary education and training. I am proud to say Arkansas is at the forefront and a leader in career and technical education (CTE) and workforce training programs, and it is important that my colleagues and I continue to prioritize and support such efforts with federal funding and legislation.
As Vice Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education (LHHS) subcommittee on the House Committee on Appropriations, I have a direct influence in prioritizing and highlighting the importance of CTE and workforce development. Earlier this year, we held a hearing called “Pipeline in the Workforce”, where industry and education experts testified before the subcommittee on the progress and challenges we face as a nation in CTE. This summer, my colleagues and I also passed through committee the Fiscal Year 2019 LHHS Appropriations bill, which included $1.9 billion for CTE and adult education.  
Parallel to an emphasis on CTE in the Appropriations Committee, in July, President Trump signed into law the Strengthening Career and Technical Education of the 21st Century Act, a bill I voted for and supported. In addition to updating the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act for the first time in over a decade, this prominent piece of legislation provides $1 billion to support states in secondary and post-secondary skills training. It also gives a stronger voice to local stakeholders on what is most effective, rather than following a one-size-fits all directive. These reforms and updates are critical to keep up with the ever-evolving business demands and I look forward to seeing positive impacts.
With these steps, I am hopeful that we as a nation can change the mindset that a four-year degree is the only pathway to a successful career and life. In addition to the abundance of jobs requiring this training, CTE provides lifelong skills without the significant financial burdens often associated with other educational paths. There is no question that educating students about all their options and creating programs that properly train and prepare them for high-demand, well-paying jobs will be good for our nation.
I am proud to support recent efforts in Congress and in the Natural State related to CTE and I will continue to work with my colleagues to keep that momentum going.

Dear  , 
I've had a busy few weeks crisscrossing eastern Connecticut. Here is a quick update on some of my recent stops. 
￼
Congressman Courtney escorting HUD New England Administrator David Tille to the site of a foundation replacement in Vernon on Wednesday
Federal Resources for Crumbling Foundations 
On Tuesday, I attended an important public hearing in Vernon supporting the use of federal funding for crumbling foundations response in our region. The towns of Vernon, Stafford and Ellington have joined together to apply for a portion of Connecticut’s annual allocation of the federal Community Development Block Grant, or CDBG, funds. Earlier this year, I raised concerns with the Connecticut Department of Housing that only $250,000 of the $1 million in CDBG funds set aside by the state to help towns with testing for crumbling foundations had been used, and that the remainder had been disbursed to other priorities. In response to my concerns, the agency re-opened the application process for CDBG-funded Crumbling Foundations projects, which these three towns are now pursuing. 
 As I said at the hearing in Vernon, we need to leverage every possible resource on the state and federal level to address the crumbling foundations crisis. That is why I fought hard to make sure that these federal resources that Connecticut receives were kept available for towns in our region – and why I will keep working hard to bring all options for addressing this crisis to the table.

Site of the Inter Royal Mill, which closed in 1985
Revitalizing the Inter Royal site in Plainfield  
Last week, I had the chance to visit the Inter Royal Mill site with EPA Regional Administrator Alex Dunn and first selectwoman of Plainfield Cathy Tendrich. The mill, which went bankrupt in 1985, was the site of a fire in 2005 that burned for three days, causing substantial amounts of damage and hazardous waste. The 2005 fire leveled the northern half of the property and created additional concerns about the future development of the property. During my visit, we discussed the developmental opportunities for the 16-acre site, and its varying potential for downtown Plainfield. The site’s centralized location downtown and intermodal connectivity with the Providence and Worcester Railroad offers promising economic potential. In 2013, Plainfield received $200,000 in assessment funding, which has helped the town and potential developers understand the contamination risks associated with the site. While there is still much to be done with regards to redevelopment, this site has incredible potential. I will continue to support Plainfield residents and officials in their vision for the site’s redevelopment.

Congressman Courtney meeting with residents at the Vernon Housing Authority this week
HUD Visit to Eastern Connecticut 
On Wednesday, I was joined by Regional Administrator for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development  (HUD) David Tille for a visit to eastern Connecticut. We started the day reviewing HUD’s efforts to help address the crumbling foundations crisis in our region. Then we visited the Vernon Housing Authority, which houses hundreds of elderly and disabled residents, as well as qualified families in our region. It was great to see how these federal dollars are used to provide tenants with not only affordable but comfortable housing in a setting that promotes community awareness, involvement, and positive relationships.
Following our visit in Vernon, we had the opportunity to meet the staff of Thames River Community Services (TRCS) and tour the Norwich location. TRCS’s lead program, the Thames River Family Program (TRFP) has housed nearly 600 families, including over 900 children, since its establishment. TRFP is the only program in the state the provides transitional housing for young families, and serves as a model for the implementation and use of federal grant money.
It was great to host David Tille in eastern Connecticut for the chance to witness and celebrate the dedicated organizations at work in our region, as well as the partnership between the state and federal government, that has made these services and opportunities possible in our state.

Congressman Courtney, David Tille and U.S. Army Veteran Alfred Fretoni at a medal ceremony Wednesday honoring Korean War veterans
Honoring Veterans of the Korean War  
This week I had the honor of joining the VFW, American Veterans, and Vietnam Veterans of America in recognizing 26 of our region's Korean War veterans. I was joined by HUD Regional Administrator David Tille, a U.S. Army war veteran himself, who delivered the keynote speech. Each veteran was presented with a medal, serving as a symbol of our nation’s gratitude for their great service and sacrifice. Though these ceremonies are an important opportunity to honor veterans in our state and region, protecting veterans’ rights in Congress remains the best way to serve those who have fought for our country. These efforts will remain at the forefront of my efforts, both in Washington and at home in eastern Connecticut.

Progress in Preserving Plum Island 
Since plans were announced to sell Plum Island, a federal research center located on an island in the Long Island Sound, I have been working on a bipartisan basis to preserve this unique ecological treasure. The process by which the federal government came to the decision to sell off the island to the highest bidder was fundamentally flawed, and I am leading bipartisan efforts in Congress to block this sale. While legislation I am working on with my colleague Congressman Lee Zeldin (R-NY) has passed the House with strong bipartisan support, the Senate has not yet acted. However, after ongoing pressure from representatives from both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Long Island Sound, as well as groups like the Save the Sound, the federal government will now update its environmental impact study on the island. The last study, completed in 2013, left out major environmental and preservation concerns that would more clearly outline the clear benefits of conserving Plum Island – making it more of a real estate appraisal than an environmental review. 
The news of an updated environmental study ensures that we will have a more complete picture of the impacts of potential development on the island as we continue to fight in Congress to prevent this unique resource from being sold off to the highest bidder. I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress from Connecticut and New York to keep at this important goal. 
 Thank you, as always, for reading this update. Do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of any assistance. 
Have a great weekend,

Dear Friend, 
This week, I urged the Majority on the House Judiciary Committee to do the important work within its jurisdiction and stop neglecting pressing issues such as ongoing voter suppression efforts, the need for criminal justice reform and President Trump’s self-dealing constitutional violations. I also reacted to the federal courtroom convictions of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the President’s long-time attorney Michael Cohen; wrote to the President to urge him to stop punishing his critics by revoking or threatening to revoke their security clearances; planned to host a Military Service Academy Day next month; welcomed our newest American citizens naturalized this month; and offered a health tip about breastfeeding. Keep reading to learn more about my week and follow me on Twitter and Facebook to see more updates as they happen.

Urging the House Judiciary Committee to Do its Job 
￼ 
Since the early days of the Trump administration, I have been urging the Majority on the House Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on criminal justice reform, re-entry programs, ongoing efforts to suppress voting rights and other matters under the committee’s jurisdiction. I have also asked that the committee pursue inquiries into the various violations of the Constitution’s anti-corruption “emoluments” clauses – violations that continue because of the President’s failure to divest his financial holdings or put them in a blind trust, as others have done. Now we are approaching a constitutional crisis with sworn testimony this week that the President ordered his lawyer to violate campaign finance laws with hush-money payments to his paramours -- and his supporters evidently plan to look the other way. Meanwhile the Committee pursues yet another meaningless investigation of the Clinton email server other congressional probes have found groundless. It is well past time for the Committee to call witnesses and get to the bottom of the real matters of concern to the American people. I joined my Democratic colleagues on the Committee in a letter asking the chairman to let us get on with the important work our citizens expect us to do. See it here.   Reacting to the Convictions of Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort 
￼  Special Counsel Robert Mueller 
On Tuesday, in federal courthouses in New York and Virginia, members of the President’s inner circle were convicted of serious crimes. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted of bank- and tax-fraud charges brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and faces up to 80 years in prison. Minutes later, Trump’s former personal lawyer and self-described “fix-it guy,” pleaded guilty to making hush-money payments to a Playboy playmate and an adult movie star to guarantee their silence, with the express purpose of affecting the 2016 presidential election, among other charges. Elements of those offenses that were within their jurisdiction were turned over to New York federal prosecutors by Mueller’s team. Despite the President’s efforts to label the Mueller investigation a “rigged witch hunt,” it is clear it is instead a very professional, disciplined criminal probe. Besides Cohen and Manafort, Mueller has brought charges against 25 other people and secured guilty pleas from former Trump national security advisor Michael Flynn; Manafort’s deputy, Rick Gates; and Russia policy campaign advisor George Papadopoulos, and others. I’m continuing to urge passage of The Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act (H.R. 5476) that I co-sponsored so that Mueller’s ongoing efforts can be protected.   Protecting the Security Clearance Process 
The President’s use of his authority to punish critics by revoking or threatening to revoke their security clearances is unprecedented and wrong. I joined colleagues in writing the President on Thursday, noting that there has been no assertion or indication that former CIA Director John Brennan or any of the individuals named on what some are calling Trump’s Nixonian “enemies list” have ever compromised or disclosed classified information. Security clearances for former government officials provide our ongoing government with access to vital institutional memory and skills that are essential to our national security. We suggested that the President follow long-established procedures for administrative review of these sensitive credentials, which include respect for the due process rights of those involved. See the letter here.   Hosting Military Service Academy-Senior ROTC Day  
￼  
On Saturday, September 29, I will host the annual Military Service Academy-Senior Reserve Officer Training Day at Crosstown High School, 1365 Tower Avenue, from 9 a.m. to noon. Appointments to one of the five military service academies – for the Navy, Air Force, Army, Merchant Marines or Coast Guard -- are life-changing events and lead to preparation of future military officers while chosen students get an excellent education and a ticket to a bright future. I look forward to seeing some aspiring applicants at the Crosstown Concourse. The high school is on the fourth floor. For more information, contact Jeremy Jordan in my Memphis office at (901) 544-4131 or Jeremy.Jordan@mail.house.gov 


Welcoming New American Citizens
￼ 
Earlier this month, members of my Memphis staff attended the monthly naturalization ceremony with U.S. District Judge Thomas L. Parker in the Clifford Davis-Odell Horton Federal Building downtown, watching as 57 people from 26 countries raised their right hands and took the oath to become American citizens. Judge Parker encouraged the new citizens to vote and the League of Women Voters was there to register them. These new Americans emigrated from such places as Somalia, Ghana, Syria, Iraq, Argentina, Taiwan, Palestine and China to follow the American dream. I welcome all the new Americans, especially those who make Memphis their home. E Pluribus Unum.   Holding Monthly “Congress On Your Corner” 
￼ 
On Thursday, my office held another “Congress On Your Corner” event, this time at the Whitehaven Branch Library, and had a good turnout. For a change, this was an evening event for constituents who can’t get away during daytime hours to get help from my staff on Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits and military service issues, Small Business Administration (SBA) loans and services, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) home loans, federal grant applications, visa and passports or help with any federal agency or department.   Signing Up for “Congress On Your Corner” and this e-Newsletter 
￼ 
I enjoy meeting regularly with constituents in the district and helping get answers for them to questions about dealing with federal agencies. If you are interested in attending one of my “Congress on Your Corner” events, you can sign up here to receive notification as soon as the next event is scheduled. 
For those who haven’t participated in a telephone town hall, it’s easy to sign up for them by using this form.   
If you would like to receive this weekly e-Newsletter, or share it with others, you can do that with this form.   Weekly Health Tip 
￼ 
Each week, I share a health tip in the hope of promoting a healthy lifestyle for residents of the 9th Congressional District. As always, it is best to check with your doctor before making any changes to your diet, exercise routine or lifestyle. 
Earlier this month, I hosted a symposium on infant and maternal health with a variety of medical specialists, advocates and social services experts. Evidence shows that mothers who breastfeed have healthier babies and are at a lower risk for some cancers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have declared August “National Breastfeeding Month,” and have outlined advantages of the practice here.   Quotes of the Week 
“A sacred respect for the Constitutional law is the vital principle, the sustaining energy, of a free government.” – Alexander Hamilton, essay in The American Daily Advertiser, August 28, 1794. 
“When occasions present themselves in which the interests of the people are at variance with their inclinations, it is the duty of the persons whom they have appointed to be the guardians of those interests to withstand the temporary delusion, in order to give them time and opportunity for more cool and sedate reflection.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 71, March 18, 1788.   As always, I remain,   Most sincerely,   ￼   Steve Cohen Member of Congress

8/24/18 17:35,Omak Senior Symposium & Update for Local Communities,"News from Congressman Dan Newhouse
￼  
Omak Senior Symposium - August 29th 
￼ 
You're invited to attend a Senior Symposium in Omak hosted by my office on August 29 from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM. The event will feature three panels of experts to help seniors and their families navigate benefits and systems available to them, from health care and Medicare to identity theft and veterans issues. The panelists will be available to answer questions and provide answers to all constituents in the 4th Congressional District. Find more details and list of participating panelists here. 
North District Priorities 
￼ 
I spoke with the Twisp and Winthrop Chambers of Commerce to discuss priorities for Okanogan County. The Methow Headwaters campaign is one issue that is important to the area, and I wrote to Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke and Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue early this year declaring my support for the proposal for a long term withdrawal of the lands that make up the headwaters of the Methow Valley. Earlier this summer, my staff was able to join the Headwaters campaign for meetings in Washington, D.C. with federal agencies to help demonstrate my strong support, and I will continue to urge the two Departments to complete their work to move forward with this effort.  
Another major issue is the prevention and mitigation of catastrophic wildfires. As part of that effort, I have been committed to ensuring we keep our North Cascades Smokejumper Base in Winthrop, the birthplace of smokejumping. 
Additionally, I have raised my voice to make sure that the local community is heard before any decision is made to move forward on transporting grizzly bears into the North Cascades. I strongly believe the concerns of people who will be most impacted by any such proposal are the most important to be heard. 
Securing Our Border 
￼ 
Did you know that the U.S. and Canada share the world's longest unfortified border? U.S. Border Patrol's Spokane Sector covers about 308 miles of the border with Canada, from the Cascade Mountains to Glacier National Park in Montana. Much of that terrain is very rugged and patrolled by horses, ATVs, and snowmobiles in winter. With so much recent attention on our southern border, which I visited earlier this summer, it's also important to focus on the needs of keeping our northern border secure. I was able to take a helicopter tour with U.S. Customs and Border Protection near the Oroville station border crossing for a firsthand look.  
Disaster Aid for Tribes 
￼ 
On August 17, President Trump declared that a major disaster exists for the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and ordered aid to supplement the Tribe's efforts in the areas affected by flooding from May 5 to May 28, 2018. I had the privilege of meeting with the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the Colville Confederated Tribes, in Omak to discuss education, health care, and natural resource management.  
Achieving the American Dream 
￼ 
This week, I was honored to address the Tri-City Regional Chamber luncheon to update their members on what is going on in Congress and connect with people in our community. Central Washington's growing economy means more opportunity for families working to achieve their American Dream, and federal policies should encourage entrepreneurs by helping - not hurting - growth. The unemployment rate continues on a downward trend in our area, and wages in the Tri-Cities area are up 3.8 percent over 2017 - among the fastest growing the state. Tri-Citians deserve a federal government whose policies foster this kind of growth through lower taxes and smarter regulation.  
We discussed several issues important to the region, such as trade policies and immigration reform, and we even played a ""heads or tails"" game, where attendees learned a little more about my motorcycle riding and love for IPA's produced in Central Washington. 
Read more about my visit to the Tri-City Regional Chamber luncheon here.  
Connecting with Grant County 
￼ 
I traveled to Grant County, where I addressed the Quincy Rotary Club. It was a pleasure to catch up with the local community members and learn about their priorities when Congress resumes work in Washington D.C. in September. We discussed the importance of the Snake and Columbia River dams to our region, which provide affordable, renewable energy (and low costs for ratepayers), as well as flood control and transportation of many of the important agricultural goods we produce in Central Washington. Additionally, we discussed the efforts in Congress to lower health care costs for Americans and provide relief from burdensome federal regulation for those of us living in rural areas. 
Thank you for reading this e-news update. It is an honor and a privilege to represent you in Congress.  
Sincerely, ￼  Dan Newhouse Member of Congress

“World’s Oldest Rock” – Yellow Medicine County
 
Dear Friends,
 
This week, I went to Washington to check on the status of the farm bill conference. I met with Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts and Ranking Member Debbie Stabenow to discuss the steps needed to complete the conference report. On Thursday, Governor Mark Dayton signed a letter to the Small Business Administration (SBA) requesting an agency disaster declaration for Lyon and Redwood counties. If declared, SBA will begin offering disaster loans in those counties for businesses affected by flooding. The Minnesota State Fair opened its gates on Thursday and will be open through September 3rd. Congratulations to Rebekka Paskewitz from Browerville on being chosen as the 65th Princess Kay of the Milky Way. Rebekka will have the honor of representing Minnesota’s dairy industry during the State Fair and throughout the next year.
 
Sincerely,
￼ Congressman Collin C. Peterson

One Year of Northwest Angle Pilot Program
￼
 
One year ago this week, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officially released new border identification check technology to local resort owners after the Northwest Angle was selected as the location for a pilot program.
 
Two years ago, resort owners in Lake of the Woods contacted my office and raised safety concerns with the Outlying Area Reporting Stations (OARS) that anglers were required to use if they recreated in nearby Canadian waters. The three OARS locations, which consisted of an unheated booth with a telephone and CBP camera for visual identification purposes, were decades old and scattered across the Angle. Oftentimes anglers would return from a day-long fishing trip in Canada and travel an extra 13 miles round trip to report their return to CBP. Winter nights at the Angle are particularly cold and long, making any extended travel dangerous. 
 
I began advocacy efforts and persuaded CBP to select Northwest Angle resorts as a testing ground for newly developed technology which would allow anglers to use tablets at the resorts to check-in with CBP. Over the past year, resorts who opted-in to the pilot program received tablets with CBP software for immediate use. Since then, the pilot has expanded to cities like Miami, FL and Buffalo, NY and is having promising results. 
 
The Northwest Angle is an ideal place for CBP to test this new technology, and I am happy to have successfully advocated for its introduction. I know how this technology impacts tourism and the local economy.
 
Farm Bill Meetings in Washington, D.C.
￼
Senate Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Debbie Stabenow and Chairman Pat Roberts
 
I returned to Washington this week to check in on progress with the farm bill conference.  I had meetings with my Agriculture Committee staff to review the status of discussions on resolving difference between the House and Senate versions of the farm bill.  I also met with Senate Agriculture Chair Pat Roberts and Ranking Member Debbie Stabenow to review the timeline and steps needed to get a conference report ready for the House and Senate to consider and pass before September 30th. We were all in agreement on the importance of getting a new farm bill passed as soon as possible.
 
To that end, the House and Senate Ag Committee leadership announced that there will be a public meeting of the conferees on Wednesday September 5th at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. We will share more details with how the public can view the meeting via the two committees’ websites.
 
Murray County Flood Damage
￼
 
On Saturday, I met with Slayton Mayor Miron Carney and Murray County Emergency Manager Heath Landsman to discuss flooding damage in the community. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Homeland Security and Emergency Management (HSEM) and Small Business Administration (SBA) officials continue to assess the potential individual assistance for counties in the southern part of my district. They have determined that Lyon and Redwood counties have met the SBA criteria for disaster related loans. 
 
On Thursday, Governor Mark Dayton signed a letter to the SBA requesting an agency disaster declaration for Lyon and Redwood counties based on the results of the SBA damage survey conducted last week. A declaration for Lyon and Redwood counties will also make loan programs available to residents in the contiguous counties, which are Brown, Cottonwood, Lincoln, Lyon, Murray, Redwood, Renville, Pipestone, and Yellow Medicine.  If declared, SBA will set up disaster loan outreach centers, presumably in Marshall and Redwood Falls.
 
Ag Centric
￼ 
I was honored to attend and speak at Central Lakes College Ag Centric Field Day today. It was interesting to watch presentations from researchers and demonstrations of drone scouting technologies for agriculture. This year marks the 50th anniversary that Central Lakes College Ag & Energy Center has been operational. I want to congratulate them on this milestone and thank those involved for their commitment to agriculture, dedication to research and contributions towards improving the agricultural economy.
 
Clay County Farm Bureau
￼
 
The Clay County Annual Farm Bureau meeting was held in Hawley this year, and my staff aide LeRoy Stumpf was able to attend. After the barbecue pork dinner, Bill Bergquist, the Clay County Sheriff and a deputy, spoke to the attendees. Clay County is in the process of building a new jail and law enforcement center, and Sheriff Bergquist shared how this project may affect farmers living in the area.
 
Norman County Farm Bureau
￼
 
Norman County Farm Bureau’s Annual meeting brought folks together for an evening of informative discussion and great food. DeMetris Reed, Jr., a Ph.D candidate at North Dakota State University’s (NDSU) Meat Science Department, prepared food for the event using skills from the BBQ Boot Camp at NDSU. DeMetris is from Houston, Texas and his family has a BBQ restaurant called Sam’s Barbecue.  
 
Livestock is an important part of the 7th District’s economy and I am glad one of my staff was able to attend this meeting. I support a strong crop and livestock economy and know how important it is for our rural communities.
 
Hemp Policy Discussion in Marshall
￼
 
Hemp has been illegal in the United States since 1937 because of the narcotic properties of certain marijuana varieties. In recent years, growing worldwide industrial demand for hemp fiber and oil has increased pressure to legalize hemp in the United States as a potentially profitable alternative crop.

Some government drug enforcement officials are opposed to legalizing industrial hemp because they believe it could complicate the identification and eradication of the drug-producing varieties and could be perceived as undercutting national anti-drug policies. While I understand their concerns, I support H.R. 3530, the Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2017, because it limits the delta-nine tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration of industrial hemp to no more than 0.3 percent. This means that industrial hemp will not have the psychoactive effects of its marijuana varieties. I cosponsored H.R. 3530 because I believe it will regulate this agricultural product in a responsible and safe manner while allowing the U.S. to participate in the increasing global market for industrial hemp. This legislation could help create jobs while continuing to prohibit dangerous drugs and protect public safety.
 
Tru Shrimp Facility Commissioning in Balaton
￼
 
Tru Shrimp commissioned its Balaton Bay Reef and Training Center in Balaton on Wednesday. This training facility will prepare workers for roles in Tru Shrimp’s other facilities in Luverne and Marshall. Tru Shrimp has been a pioneer in the shrimp aquaculture industry by developing methods for raising healthy shrimp in a man-made, controlled environment. Their success has allowed them to expand by constructing the “Luverne Bay Harbor” in Luverne that will house 256 shrimp tanks on roughly 30 acres near Luverne. Tru Shrimp expects its first harvest in July of 2019.
 
VA Mental Health Summit
￼
 
My staff aide Meg Louwagie attended the 6th Annual VA Mental Health Summit on Monday. Many issues affecting veterans’ mental health were discussed at the Summit. Topics included the public health approach to suicide prevention, understanding the cause of opioid use disorders and methods for identifying those disorders, and the different treatment options available to veterans in Minnesota.
 
Kermit Nelson Prepares for Steam Threshers Reunion
￼
 
One of my staff aides met with Kermit Nelson from Hawley this week. Kermit is putting the finishing touches on a tractor he built and hopes to bring to the Western Minnesota Steam Threshers Reunion in Rollag (Aug.31 – Sept. 3). There is a build-your-own machine competition, so he built a tractor from an old John Deere swather and a John Deere manure spreader. Kermit’s tractor is fashioned after a 1910 International one-cylinder oil pull. Kermit said that in its day, it could pull a six-bottom plow with its one cylinder.  
 
Princess Kay of the Milky Way
￼
 
Rebekka Paskewitz of Bowerville became the 65th Princess Kay of the Milky Way on Wednesday. Princess Kay is chosen the night before the opening of the Minnesota State Fair to represent Minnesota’s dairy industry for the following year. Ms. Paskewitz’s first official duty was to sit for 6 hours as butter sculptor Linda Christensen carved her likeness into a 90-pound block of butter on the opening day of the state fair. Princess Kay will make appearances during the State Fair, and at other events throughout the year. Congratulations to Rebekka, and to the entire Paskewitz family, for this honor.
 
This Week in American History
￼
 
On August 22, 1912, Coya Knutson was born in Edmore, North Dakota. In 1954 she became the first female member of Congress from Minnesota, and she went on to be respected nationwide for her stance on agriculture issues and her championing of the family farmer. In 1958, however, political rivals from her own party conspired with her husband Andy Knutson to keep her from winning a third congressional term. Known as the ""Coya Come Home"" episode, this scandal is often said to overshadow her political record as a congresswoman.
 
What’s the Story?
￼
 
Minnesota’s Seventh Congressional District is home to several public and private colleges and universities. Minnesota State University Moorhead, founded in 1887, serves roughly 6,000 students each year, offering undergraduate degrees in over 140 fields of study. The school also offers a range of graduate degrees and certification programs. The MSU Moorhead Dragons represent the school in NCAA Division II sports. The Dragon’s mascot shown above can be found in my office in Washington, D.C.

I kicked it off with a visit to Hunter Haven Farms in Pearl City, a dairy farm run by two brothers whose cows produce 1/3 of the Swiss Cheese in the U.S. Then, I was a Biodiesel Operational Specialist at Adkins Energy in Lena where I learned how corn becomes ethanol or biodiesel. I also learned how to produce gluconate at PMP Fermentation Products in Peoria and worked on a light conversion project at Spoon River Electric Cooperative in Canton. I had so much fun visiting all of these great local businesses throughout the week! Click here to see more.

Congresswoman Bustos presenting funding from the United States Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development program 
Today, I was pleased to announce funding from the USDA’s Rural Development program for the Villages of Joy and Tampico to improve water treatment facilities. In Joy, I announced more than $3 million in funding for the construction of a new water treatment facility which also includes an emergency generator, rehabilitation and chemical treatment of wells, installation and replacement of water lines, a ground storage tank and aerator, elevated water tower and the replacement of 100 residential water meters. Then for the Village of Tampico, I announced more than $2.5 million in funding to replace 2.47 miles of water main line. Access to clean drinking water is essential and I’m proud to make these announcements today. Click here to read more about Joy and Tampico.

August 24, 2018 
Dear friend,  I invited Secretary of the Interior Zinke to the Central Valley to witness the direct impacts that Sacramento’s dangerous water grab would have on our community and our message was successfully delivered.  A few weeks ago, the Secretary and I toured the Don Pedro and New Melones Reservoirs in order for the Secretary to see first-hand the importance of these critical water storage projects, as well as to discuss the urgent need for more water storage and protecting Valley water rights. Following the Secretary’s Visit, the Department of the Interior (DOI) released a statement noting that Sacramento’s proposed water grab would “directly interfere with the New Melones Project’s ability to store water.” It also recognized that the grab violates the structure of our water rights and authorities that were put in place by Congress.  Since then, Secretary Zinke has issued an internal memo directing his agencies to develop a plan within the next 25 days to maximize water supply, construct new water storage, and resolve issues with the state. His memo called Sacramento’s water grab an “unacceptable restriction” that hinders the Department of the Interior’s mission to deliver water to the Central Valley.  I am dedicated to working with the Administration to put an end to the state’s water grab, and while the support of the Secretary and the Bureau of Reclamation is a major step in the right direction, this fight is not over yet. That is why I passed an amendment through the U.S. House of Representatives that prevents any federal agency from participating in the state’s plan, meaning that water from the federally-owned New Melones can’t be used in the state’s water grab. Awaiting a vote in the Senate, my amendment protects a critical piece of our water storage, while at the same time putting an end to this misguided plan.  As your Representative, it is my duty to take this issue head-on to safeguard Valley water. I will not stop fighting to protect our water rights and to push policies like the New WATER Act that will help solve California’s storage crisis and keep the Valley fertile and prosperous for generations to come. 
￼  
Addressing homelessness head-on This week I held a roundtable in Modesto to bring local government officials, community activists, and citizens together to address our growing homelessness crisis here in the Valley. This crisis demands new, innovative solutions and a full scale effort locally and across all levels of government to combat homelessness, and this roundtable was a step towards making that happen.  On the federal level, I’m taking action to address this problem in Congress with legislation that will directly help groups here at home who are working to fight homelessness locally. I recently spearheaded an effort to save Transition Living Program (TLP) and Maternity Group Home (MGH) grants from a lapse in federal funding. This efforts success meant that organizations like the Center for Human Services in Modesto avoided a possible lapse in federal funds that would have caused major cuts or permanent closures. I am also a cosponsor of H.R. 4099, the Homeless Veteran Families Act, H.R. 2069, the Fostering Stable Housing Opportunities Act, and H.R. 5339, the Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act, important bills that help homeless veterans, improve residency for foster children, and bolster critical transitional living programs. I look forward to continuing to bring our community leaders together to help address this issue and plan on hosting a follow-up event at H.O.S.T. House in Patterson later this fall.

Stop the Tax Hike on Churches
 
Many of you have likely heard about a new tax reform policy affecting churches and charitable organizations.
Due to the passage of the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, churches, synagogues, and other nonprofit organizations will begin paying a 21 percent tax on some fringe benefits including those for transportation, meals, and parking. Not only will the GOP tax bill add over $1.4 trillion to the deficit, but they are forcing places of worship and charitable organizations to pay for these massive tax breaks.  
This is something that is unprecedented. 
Places of worship have long received tax-exempt status. There are synagogues, churches, organizations paying thousands of dollars in taxes that they have never had to pay before. 
Next week, I will host a meeting with clergy and charitable organizations in the Kansas City metro area to inform them of this new policy. I have asked Brandon Casey from the House Ways and Means Committee, in Washington, D.C. to join me to help answer questions and address concerns regarding this new tax on churches.  
I co-sponsored H.R. 6504 the “Stop the Tax Hike on Charities and Places of Worship Act”, introduced by my colleague, Congressman James E. Clyburn of South Carolina. This bill will repeal the provision of the Republican tax bill that would increase taxes on charities and places of worship and pay for it by raising the corporate tax rate by a single percentage point.
I will not stand idly by while religious institutions and charitable organizations bear the brunt of the new tax plan.  
Warmly,
￼
Emanuel Cleaver, II 
Member of Congress

Honoring Chief Warrant Officer 3, Taylor J. Galvin 

This week, we received the devastating news that Fort Campbell had lost one of its great soldiers. I want to extend my sincerest condolences to the family and friends of Chief Warrant Officer 3 Taylor J Galvin, who was killed in a helicopter crash in Baghdad this week. His elite unit was conducting a mission against ISIS when the crash occurred. Officer Galvin was one of Fort Campbell’s finest 160th SOAR aviators. His sacrifice in service to our country and our freedom will never be forgotten. My thoughts and prayers are with his loved ones, as they mourn the loss of a great hero.
￼

Fighting for Tennessee Jobs 

This week, my colleague, Congressman Jeff Duncan from South Carolina and I sent a letter to Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, urging him to approve and expedite an exclusion request from the Section 232 Steel Tariffs for Nashville-based Bridgestone.   
Bridgestone is one of the many successful companies that chose Tennessee as their home because of our low tax, business-friendly environment. Bridgestone employs hundreds of hardworking Tennesseans at their manufacturing plant in Clarksville, and all across the state. This specific tariff would negatively impact Bridgestone’s access to quality steel wire rod that their factories depend on as a crucial input in manufacturing tires. The Section 232 tariffs would greatly increase costs for Bridgestone and threaten their ability to maintain and create good jobs for Tennesseans. I have always stood up for Tennessee jobs, and support Bridgestone’s role as an innovator and job-creator in our great state. Broad tariffs like these threaten to hurt Tennessee companies and employees and I look forward to a speedy resolution.  
Working To Repeal WOTUS 
Many of you have called and asked about the recent South Carolina District Court’s ruling regarding the 2015 Clean Water Rule entitled ‘Waters of the United States’ (“the WOTUS rule”). Unfortunately, this court decision re-established WOTUS in 26 states, including Tennessee. The Obama-administration’s harmful WOTUS rule sought to regulate bodies of water on farm and forestry land such as drainage ditches and puddles that have no business being regulated by the federal government. Moreover, the rule expands government jurisdiction far beyond the constitutional scope established by Congress and affirmed by the Supreme Court.

Tennessee farmers, ranchers, and landowners of all kind have told me that this rule will greatly harm their businesses and threaten their livelihoods. I have been working for years in Congress to get this rule off the books. Last year, the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set in place a two-year delay of the rule that was unfortunately overturned this week by a South Carolina District court. Yesterday, I signed a letter along with my colleagues in Congress urging House and Senate Farm Bill conferees to include a full repeal of WOTUS in any final package that is passed in September. I am also working with the EPA and Members of the Tennessee delegation to urge the administration to appeal the district court’s decision, and officially rescind this rule.

This rule will increase costs, create confusion and uncertainty, and place undue burdens not just on Tennesseans whose livelihoods depend on their ability to work the land, but on all sectors of our economy that rely on the food and fuel that farmers produce. With agriculture and forestry contributing almost $75 billion to our state’s economy each year, we simply cannot afford for this rule to become law. 
Tennesseans Benefiting From Tax Reform 
Throughout the past year, I have heard countless stories from Tennessee families and businesses telling me about how the tax reform bill has impacted them for the better. This week, I want to highlight one in particular. Acadia Healthcare, headquartered in Franklin, is a leading provider of opioid treatment and behavioral health services in our state and nation. Acadia provides addiction services to patients in a variety of settings, including inpatient psychiatric hospitals, specialty treatment facilities, residential treatment centers, and outpatient clinics.

After the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump, Acadia announced that they would add new jobs, open additional treatment centers, and expand existing facilities due to the extraordinary benefits from the tax reform bill. The work that organizations like Acadia do to fight the opioid epidemic and treat mental illness is so important, especially when we are facing a nationwide opioid epidemic. It’s a true pleasure to hear how Tennessee companies are using the tax cuts to reinvest in their employees and communities. I will continue to push for lower taxes and less regulation in Congress because at the end of the day, you know how to spend your money better than the government.
The Importance of Fort Campbell 

Today, I had the privilege of meeting with the Garrison Command Team at Fort Campbell with my good friend from Iowa, Senator Joni Ernst. We discussed the vital importance of this Army Installation to our surrounding communities, state, and nation - both from an economic and national security standpoint. Senator Ernst and I toured the 320th Field Artillery, Apache Trail, and Campbell Army Airfield, and met with soldiers of the M777 Howitzer Crew who briefed us on their operations and priorities.
 ￼  
￼  ￼
It is crucial that we continue to support the 101st Airborne Division and soldiers at Fort Campbell who provide unmatched Air Assault capabilities and fight every day to secure our nation and its citizens.

Yours in Service,
￼

Long’s Short Report – The importance of the Federal Trade Commission
By Rep. Billy Long
It’s difficult to sit down in a restaurant these days without having folks come up to me asking what can be done to stop the incessant robocalls that plague all of us. They mostly ask why the do not call list seems to have no teeth. 
In 1914, Congress passed the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act, which established the FTC. Since this independent agency’s inception, the FTC’s role has grown from promoting competition among businesses to now protecting consumers from unfair and deceptive business practices. 
The FTC is led by a five-member commission appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. To ensure the FTC is fair, the five-member commission can have no more than three individuals from the same political party and each member can serve no more than one 7-year term. 
This bipartisan agency has numerous ways to enforce its mission of promoting competition and protecting consumers. Some of those ways include the number of laws and rules that give the FTC administrative and enforcement responsibilities, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Do-Not-Call Implementation Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule. These laws and rules are designed to ensure that competition isn’t limited, consumer choice isn’t harmed and prices don’t rise due to limited competition among businesses. 
In 1938, to ensure business practices remain fair, the FTC expanded its jurisdiction to make sure that consumers are protected from deceptive practices, which includes practices that are unethical, cause harm to the consumers or break the law. And with technological advances, this remains a constant battle for the FTC, specifically in areas such as data. 
The Energy and Commerce Committee, which I am a member of, has actively been working with the FTC to make sure both consumers and businesses are protected. We have held multiple hearings during the 115th Congress that examine primarily consumer protection laws, such as combatting robocalls, and ways we in Congress can improve them and ensure that the FTC can carry out its mission. 
As the FTC continues to crackdown on unfair practices against consumers and businesses, we in Congress will make sure it has the authority and resources to do so.

8/24/18 17:12,Blaine’s Bulletin: This Week in Missouri-03,"￼ 
August 24, 2018

BLAINE'S BULLETIN

With only a week until Labor Day, the House of Representatives district work period is quickly coming to a close. This month, I’ve had the opportunity to meet with many constituents and business owners across the district to talk about their legislative priorities. This week I met with a variety of groups to hear their stories, and I’d like to share just a few. 
I had the opportunity to meet with local leaders in the fight against human trafficking, including St. Charles Prosecuting Attorney Tim Lohmar, O’Fallon Police chief Roy Joachimstaler, and representatives from the Department of Homeland Security, the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, the Child Advocacy Center, and Gateway Human Trafficking. They briefed me on the role our local community’s law enforcement and district attorney’s offices play in finding justice for victims. In April, President Trump signed legislation sponsored by fellow Missourian, Congresswoman Ann Wagner which took a huge step in the fight against online sex trafficking. I was proud to cosponsor this important legislation, but we must continue our work to fight these terrible crimes and protect children across the globe. 
￼
Congressman Luetkemeyer meets with the Human Trafficking Task Force.
I also toured the Child Advocacy Center in Wentzville, where they provided me with an update on their expansion efforts. It was great to see their build out as they provide a safe child advocacy center serving child victims of sexual abuse, physical abuse, and children who witness violence. We must continue to prioritize these children and ensure they are provided with the opportunity to succeed.
Back in my office, I met with representatives from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Many of us have family members or friends who have suffered from MS, and we’ve seen firsthand just how important innovation and advanced research is to putting an end to the disease.  The National Multiple Sclerosis Society are great advocates for patients and their family members.  I enjoyed discussing their priorities along with upcoming legislation to support their mission.  
￼
Congressman Luetkemeyer meets with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.
In St. Charles County, I had the opportunity to tour the new state-of-the-art Emergency Operations Center which will provide a place to house all of the County’s emergency communications functions, allowing for a more coordinated and efficient response during an emergency. The new facility will be critical for constituents in St. Charles County in the event of a natural disaster. It was a pleasure to see the Emergency Operations Center for myself and I am confident it will serve the people of St. Charles County well.
Finally, I had the opportunity to tour the FAA’s TRACON facility, which serves as the primary air-traffic-control facility for St. Louis Lambert International Airport. There are few jobs more stressful than an air-traffic controller, and I’m extremely grateful for the hard working professionals who make sure thousands of people who fly in and out of Missouri each day safely. We discussed future funding concerns, and I look forward to working with my Congressional colleagues to keep this facility running.
It was an exciting week in Missouri’s third district, and I thank everyone for making the time to discuss your priorities with me!

Fannie and Freddie End Subsidy Program for Large Private Investors
This week, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) announced it was ending a single-family rental pilot program first authorized in 2016. The pilot allowed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to subsidize private sector investments in the single family rental market. FHFA ended the program citing its recognition that large private sector investors in this market are doing fine and don’t need the federal government’s assistance. 
I am pleased FHFA has ended this program. I raised concerns about it last year when a Fannie Mae investment benefiting Blackstone, the largest private sector landlord in America and one of the world’s largest private equity groups, came to light. That transaction involved Fannie Mae guaranteeing a $1 billion loan provided by Wells Fargo to Blackstone’s property management subsidiary, Invitation Homes, an entity that has generated consistent protests from tenants and consumer rights groups for its abysmal record on property maintenance, rent increases, and responsiveness. 
As I wrote in a letter to FHFA last year, “The lack of transparency surrounding this transaction leaves many questions about whether this is a good deal for the families living in these properties, for the communities in which these properties are located, for potential homebuyers, and for local landlords who already face severe barriers to competition. We have no idea if this deal results in more affordable rents, better lease terms for renters, or what other uses could have been made of the precious government guarantee in lieu of subsidizing an entity flush with its own resources and with endless opportunity to access the capital markets for its funding needs.” I have consistently pushed FHFA and the GSEs to use their considerable presence in the housing market to focus on outcomes for homeowners, communities, and the affordable housing missions of their agencies. This action is, hopefully, a step in that direction. 
Meeting with AIPAC
I met with constituents who are active in AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. We had a thoughtful and frank discussion. They thanked me for supporting H.R. 5141, the United States-Israel Security Assistance Authorization Act of 2018.  I am one of 284 co-sponsors in the House and there are 72 in the Senate, reflecting broad bi-partisan support in Congress for the safety of Israel and the maintaining of its qualitative military edge. We also discussed H.R.  1697, the Israel Anti-Boycott Act.  I told them, as they well knew, that I am opposed to the BDS, Boycott, Divestment, and Sanction Movement, and had fought divestment locally. I could not, however, support this bill.  I object on First Amendment grounds because it imposes penalties for advocacy. We then spoke, candidly, about the policies of President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu. I expressed my concern that moving the United States Embassy would needlessly embitter our relations with states that might, otherwise, be helpful in supporting a two-state solution. I also noted my fear that settlement construction in the West Bank would make lasting peace more difficult.  Finally, we spoke about the troubling resurgence of anti-Semitism and resolved to remain in close touch about how best to combat this hateful bigotry.  Celebrating the Dearborn Academy Ribbon Cutting
I joined Mayor Marty Walsh, Treasurer Deb Goldberg, local officials, community leaders, faculty, students and parents at a ribbon cutting ceremony for the Dearborn 6-12 STEM/Early College Academy in Roxbury yesterday. The state-of-the-art building has been completely reconstructed with the assistance of the Massachusetts School Building Authority. It is the first new school building built in Boston in 15 years. With an emphasis on science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), educators at Dearborn Academy help students prepare for 21st century challenges. I had the opportunity to walk around the school before the ribbon cutting and was impressed with the new academic spaces. As the first day of school approaches for many families, it was great to spend some time with students, parents and teachers preparing for a new school year in their brand new building.
Behind the Curtain – More House and Trump Administration Actions You Don’t Want to Miss
Here are this week’s additions. If you need to catch up or share with friends, you can find the full list here.
347:     According to an August 2018 report in the Guardian, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is relying on an old high school football buddy to review requests for scientific research funding over $50,000. Zinke’s friend, Steve Howke, is not a scientist and has no experience working in any scientific field. He has a degree in business administration and his professional experience involves working for credit unions. The Interior Department has more than $5 billion in funding that it directs to outside groups for research on topics such as land acquisition and conservation. This additional layer of review by someone with no scientific background has significantly slowed down the whole process. Zinke has demonstrated in numerous ways that he is not interested in addressing climate change. The Climate Adaptation Science Centers, which have consistently received this funding, are negatively impacted by this new policy. Located at 8 different universities, the centers study climate change. They have been forced to delay research in some cases and hold  off on hiring in others. 
348:       According to August 2018 media reports the Trump administration is rolling back a 2015 Obama administration rule regulating power plant emissions. The rule was a component of a plan to combat climate change by requiring power plants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Trump’s proposed rule would require these plants to reduce emissions by a fraction of what was previously required. It does nothing to address climate change, but does go a long way in setting us back further.

The Hill Report   A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions Week of August 20 - August 24, 2018
As we continue to work our way through the mire of immigration reform in Congress, it is critical that we have all of the facts at hand. Late last week, the independent, nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a study I requested in 2015 entitled ""Criminal Alien Statistics: Information on Incarcerations, Arrests, Convictions, Costs, and Removals.”  The report sheds even more light on an alarming Obama-era practice that allowed criminal illegal aliens to roam our streets rather than placing them behind bars where those who break the law belong. While percentages of criminal aliens in state and federal prisons decreased between 2011 and 2016 according to the report, the current administration, which stringently enforces our immigration laws, has found gang members, human traffickers, and drug smugglers were allowed to cross our border freely and directly into our state and country.   This report proves that our national security was neglected by the previous administration and it is time we in Congress ensure a return to law and order by securing our southern border and protecting American families from criminals. You can read the full report here.  Meetings in Dallas  Korean American Coalition   I was honored to receive recognition from the Korean American Coalition at their banquet over the weekend. Korean Americans contribute significantly to the Dallas community and U.S. economy, and they have some of the highest rates of small business ownership. Their community offers just one example of immigrant success and achievement of the American Dream. Suzanne Scholte, a human rights activist who has spent much time addressing issues on the Korean peninsula, gave the keynote speech on the atrocities of the Kim regime and the steps the global community can take to bring peace to the area.

Republic National Distributing Co.  On Monday, I was delighted to join my friends at Republic National Distributing Company’s North Texas facility. During our tour of the facility, I was able to see firsthand how the reinvestment in their company made possible by the Tax Cut and Jobs Act are impacting their business operations. RNDC employs over 850 Texans in the DFW area alone, and I am proud that Republicans in Congress were able to come together to pass such vital legislation that allows American businesses to not just succeed but thrive.

Jake Mercier with Highland Park High School  This week I was delighted to sit down with Jake Mercier, a recent graduate from Highland Park High School (HPHS), to discuss mental health issues facing our community and our nation. As Class President of HPHS, Jake Mercier took it upon himself to call on the administration to hire more mental health counselors at Highland Park High School and Highland Park Middle School, as well as other much needed reforms for the system. As an advocate of healthcare providers, I am happy to work with mental health professionals to help their patients and better our communities. I believe we must continue to invest in programs that teach people and train counselors to identify mental illnesses and then help direct those affected towards suitable and productive treatment pathways.

Texas Security Bank   I was pleased to speak at Texas Security Bank regarding the robust American economy, visible positive impact of tax reform, and my efforts to tailor financial regulation. Indicators of employment and consumer strength are strong; we have seen record unemployment numbers across various groups and retail sales are up. As your representative in Washington, I am committed to free-market policies that support economic growth and will continue to work with my colleagues to help improve the lives of American families.

Alzheimers Foundation  This week I visited a Memories in the Making class for residents of the Memory Unit of the Plaza at Richardson in conjunction with Lifetime Wellness. The program developed by the Alzheimer's Association allows individuals with Alzheimer's or other dementia to express themselves through art. As individuals with dementia lose the ability to communicate with words, they may discover a capacity to recover lost memories, tell stories and express emotions through drawing and painting.  More important than the pictures and stories, however, is the sense of well-being and pleasure that comes with participating in a supportive, social environment. At the end of the class, I accepted a piece of finished artwork from one of the participants. It was such a delight to meet with each of the staff and to see the great work and advances they are making with their touch of love to those who are experiencing memory loss as well as their families. A big thank you to the Alzheimer’s ! Association for inviting me to be there.

8/24/18 17:03,Rep. Grothman Newsletter- Protecting Our Dairy Farmers ,"￼ 
  

Trade Update
The agriculture industry represents a vital economic sector in the 6th district. As a result, it is important to ensure that the nation's trade policies reflect the goals of farmers and businesses throughout the district. As the Administration resumes negotiations with China and the EU and paves the way for the renegotiation of NAFTA, it is essential that we protect farmers throughout Wisconsin. 

Over the past couple months, retaliatory tariffs imposed by key trading partners have presented a significant burden towards many farmers and business owners throughout the state. In order to reduce the negative impact on individuals harmed by the tariffs, particularly farmers and ranchers, the Administration is preparing to roll out a relief package to address the loss in revenue many have experienced. 

This week, I signed onto a bipartisan letter strongly urging Secretary Perdue and Director Mulvaney to keep in mind the unique needs of dairy farmers when considering the commodities that are in need of aid. Dairy farmers are at a disadvantage due to the fact that their product is perishable and produced daily at a high rate. 

Modernizing our trade policies to create fair trading partnerships and prioritize American businesses is very important. I hope that as the Administration continues their efforts and proposed relief package, they acknowledge the dairy industry and the many farmers within it that provide Americans with food everyday.

￼
             

Employing Young Professionals
This summer, the unemployment rate among young Americans fell to the lowest level we've seen in over half a century! Americans between the ages of 16-24 are experiencing access to more opportunities now than they have in several years. 

As companies and organizations nationwide experience the positive impact brought about by policies such as Tax Reform, more young individuals are being hired and gaining valuable workforce experience. The job market is booming and I urge our nation's young professionals to take advantage of the opportunities presented through widespread economic growth.

This Week in Congress
August 24, 2018

• Dialogue with HR partners
• Chamber supports status bill
• ...and more cosponsors added
• Concern grows about tourist parole
• Thank you, Officer Ho
• Holandez honored for firearm skills
• NMI airports get $5.6 million
• $2.8M for Kannat Tabla drainage
• $1.1M to BECQ for coastal management 
• $167k for coral reef protection
• Funds for invasive species hire
• $95k for local nonprofits 
• Opportunities
• Legislative Highlights
 
 

On Thursday, I briefed the members of the Society for Human Resource Management-NMI Chapter on the Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act. I thanked SHRM for their collaboration and feedback during the drafting of the legislation. Now that the bill is law, our HR professionals will play a critical role in helping our businesses understand and comply with the new requirements. As I said to the SHRM members this week — as with any new law, there will be bumps on the road. The congressional office is committed to helping them get over those bumps, as we have for the last 10 years. 
 

Chamber supports status bill

The Saipan Chamber of Commerce is supporting the Northern Mariana Islands Workforce Stabilization Act, legislation I introduced to give U.S. permanent resident status to long-term workers and investors. Chamber President Velma Palacios wrote, “The changes outlined in this bill would provide an avenue for existing foreign workers to remain in the CNMI to support our businesses. We very much appreciate your effort and attention to our workforce issues.” And I appreciate the Chamber’s letter. Official statements of support from community leaders can be extremely helpful to me in moving legislation in Congress. I hope other community organizations take a look at the bill, and come to the same conclusion as the Chamber: converting CW workers to U.S. workers is one way to respond to the needs of our growing economy. The Saipan Chamber comprises more than 160 private businesses, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations. 
 

More cosponsors for status bill 

Three more Members of Congress have co-sponsored the Northern Mariana Islands Workforce Stabilization Act, bringing the total number of Republicans and Democrats supporting my bill to 27. Representatives Jackie Speier (D-California), Barbara Lee (D-California), and Yvette Clark (D-New York) all added their names to H.R. 6578. I wanted to include status for long-term workers to the U.S. Workforce Act, Public Law 115-218, but legislation requires negotiation. And when you negotiate, you do not get everything you want. This year, what was most important for the Marianas economy — and for long-term workers — was to get 10 more years and reset the CW cap to 13,000. And we succeeded. Next year, I expect Democrats will regain control of the House and introduce a comprehensive immigration bill. I plan to “piggyback” the Stabilization Act on that larger bill and finally reach my goal of status for our long-term workers and investors.
 
 

U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Director of Field Operations Brian Humphrey (third from right) briefed me on the growing concern at the Department of Homeland Security regarding parole in the Marianas, the only place in the U.S. where Chinese can enter without prior paperwork. Along with others, I convinced then-Secretary Janet Napolitano in 2009 to allow these Chinese tourists to enter using parole. But abuses, like construction workers posing as tourists, and the growth in numbers — from 30,000 in 2009 to 230,000 now — are causing the Trump administration to reconsider this discretionary program. On Friday, Governor Torres announced that he is using his influence with President Trump to ensure that parole for Chinese and Russian tourists continues. I thank the Governor for keeping us all informed of his action.
 
 

Congratulations to Customs and Border Protection Officer Alex Ho, who retires in October after 30 years of dedicated service and professionalism. Thank you, Officer Ho, for your efforts to keep our nation safe.
 
 

Kudos to Customs and Border Protection Officer Feliciano Holandez, who was recognized for firearms proficiency by CBP Field Operations Director Brian Humphrey. 
 

NMI airports get $5.6 million

The Commonwealth Ports Authority is receiving $5,642,122 in federal grant funding, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced this week. The Tinian International Airport has been awarded $4,548,774 in entitlement and discretionary funds to improve the Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting building. Building renovations will enhance firefighting and rescue capabilities to help meet federal safety standards. The Benjamin Taisacan Manglona International Airport in Rota will receive $1,093,348 to rehabilitate 7,000 feet of existing runway markings. Congratulations to CPA.
 

$2.8M for Kannat Tabla drainage

The Commonwealth Department of Public Works is getting $2,783,988 to reduce runoff that causes flooding at Kannat Tabla Road, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced Thursday. DPW will use the funds to build a drainage system to divert rainwater to the quarry site at Kannat Tabla. This grant is part of federal aid the Commonwealth received in the aftermath of Typhoon Soudelor. No local match is required. Congratulations, DPW.

 

$1.1M to BECQ for coastal management

The Bureau of Environmental and Coastal Quality will receive a $1.1 million FY18 Coastal Zone Management formula grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The grant, increased $85,000 from the previous year, supports jobs and BECQ’s coastal management programs. I supported the increase in federal funding for these grants made under the National Coastal Zone Management Program in my FY18 appropriation requests for the Department of Commerce. These funds will help BECQ address the growth of our tourism economy and the need for guidance on responsible and resilient coastal development. One project will be to offer best practices for building and infrastructure improvements that integrate coastal hazards data and resiliency principles into ongoing development. Funds will also support increased transparency as new web-based tools ensure that information about permitting and enforcement activities is directly accessible to the public and updated in real-time.
 

$167k for coral reef protection

Our efforts in Congress to ensure adequate funding for the Office of Insular Affairs Coral Reef and Natural Resources initiative paid off this week with the Department of Interior’s announcement of $1.345 million in FY2018 protection grants to the Insular Affairs, including $166,949 to our Bureau of Environmental and Coastal Quality. The Trump Administration had proposed a budget of only $946,000 for the conservation initiative but Congress restored $400,000 to this important program. BECQ will use the funding for the Laolao Watershed management plan, coral reef nursery development, and other projects. My colleagues and I are again working to block the Trump administration as they have proposed another ill-advised $400,000 budget cut to this conservation program in FY2019, which begins October 1. 
 

Funds for invasive species hire

A $95,170 grant from the Office of Insular Affairs to the Department of Land and Natural Resources will fund an Invasive Species Coordinator for the Northern Marianas. The grant is part of $1,448,890 provided by Congress to the insular areas to combat invasive species and support priorities highlighted in the Pacific Regional Biosecurity Plan. The coordinator will provide policy direction, coordinate among local and federal agencies, and plan for control and eradication of harmful species infestations such as the rhinoceros beetle that was found recently on Rota. 
 

$95k for local nonprofits

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced that Karidat Catholic Charities and the Northern Mariana Islands Chapter of the American Red Cross have been selected to receive funding totaling $95,000 from the Nonprofit Security Grant Program. This grant will help these Marianas nonprofits obtain the resources required to support and integrate their preparedness activities with broader local preparedness efforts. Congratulations Karidat and the NMI Chapter of the American Red Cross!

This Week in the Office of Senator Marco Rubio 
Following the introduction of my South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act, I took a boat tour of Sanibel and Captiva to survey the damage that red tide and fish kills have caused to the area. I also held a roundtable discussion with local officials to discuss water quality and local economic impact. Read more about my visit here.
￼ 
Thursday the Senate approved a FY2019 Minibus appropriations package that includes funding for the Department of Defense, Labor, Health and Human, Education, Related Agencies. The bill also includes key measures that I advanced to address harmful algal blooms and supporting mental health programs at low-income schools. It also included a measure to prevent Americans’ DNA from going to Chinese and Russian labs for analysis. Read more here.
￼ 
On Fox News’ Tucker Carlson Tonight I discussed the Chinese government’s oppression of Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, including the existence of “political re-education camps’ where upwards of 800,000 to 1 million people are arbitrarily detained. Watch the full interview here.
￼ 
As the opioid crisis continues to plague communities across the country, I raised the issue of Chinese precursor chemicals and fentanyl increasingly trafficked through Central America into the United States with Francisco Palmieri, nominee to be U.S. Ambassador to Honduras at a Senate Foreign Relations hearing. See the full exchange here.
￼ 
My paid family leave legislation has been hailed by many as a common sense, budget neutral plan. Read what they’re saying about my bill here.
￼ 
On Thursday, the Senate unanimously passed the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (S. 2946), bipartisan legislation that I introduced with Senator Chuck Grassley, to improve access to justice in U.S. courts for Americans who are victimized by acts of terrorism while abroad. Read more here.

“Rubio, Nelson file algae bill as Feds increase lake discharges” (Politico, 8/23/2018)
“It is time to put our pro-life and pro-family beliefs to action by supporting the ‘Economic Security for New Parents Act’ just introduced by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.). This plan gives parents the option of funding paid leave after the birth or adoption of a baby by drawing on their own social security funds.” (Paid family leave could give new parents a much-needed lifeline, The Hill, 8/20/2018)

“Rubio blasts El Salvador's switch from Taiwan to China as 'terrible mistake,' threatens to end funding” (Taiwan News, 8/21/2018)
“That's actually a point in Rubio's proposal's favor compared to other paid leave plans:  unlike mandates on employers or across the board entitlement programs, since this program wouldn't require significant new costs for businesses, few would dump existing benefits and push workers into a system that requires them to trade off future retirement benefits for paid leave.” (Introducing Flexibility Into A Government Program Isn't The Same As Expanding It, Forbes, 8/21/2018)
“’The administration’s maximum pressure campaign will not succeed if the Islamic Republic remains connected to SWIFT,’ the lawmakers wrote. The GOP members, including Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia, praised Trump’s reported desire to impose sanctions on ‘directors of SWIFT and their employing financial institutions.’” (GOP senators urge Treasury to remove Iran from key financial network, Washington Examiner, 8/23/2018)
""’I have long been concerned about the presence of Chinese government-run Confucius Institutes on American university campuses given the threat that these institutes pose to academic freedom as well as possible national security concerns,’ Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) said in a statement to the Washington Free Beacon. ‘The FBI has warned that the Chinese government uses non-traditional intelligence collection and exploits the openness of our academic research environment, so it is imperative that academic institutions, as well as the Defense Department and other federal agencies that are funding potentially sensitive research, be mindful of this threat,’ he added.” (Lawmakers Raise Concerns Over DOD Grants to Colleges Hosting Confucius Institutes, Free Beacon, 8/20/2018)
“Rubio’s amendment, S. Amdt. 3851, would prohibit states or school districts receiving federal money from adopting school discipline policies that discourage the reporting of offenses to law enforcement, or that interfere with law enforcement. Specifically, his amendment says schools can’t develop policies that discourage the arrest of a student for any display of ‘verbal or physical threatening behavior towards others, including acts of violence resulting from expulsion from school, threats involving firearms or other weapons, and other actions resulting in a reasonable fear of bodily injury.’” (Republicans seek to tack school safety proposals onto ‘minibus’, Politico, 8/23/2018)
Legislation Introduced…
	•	Senator Bill Nelson and I introduced the South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act, legislation that would direct the Interagency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to assess the causes and consequences of HABs in Lake Okeechobee and around Florida’s south and southwestern coast to determine the federal resources available to solve these challenges.
	•	Senator Nelson and I introduced an amendment to the fiscal year 2019 Labor, Health, and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies appropriations bill that would provide $1 million of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funds for areas affected by harmful algal blooms.
	•	Senator Cory Gardner and I introduced an amendment that would restrict U.S. funding to El Salvador. We introduced this amendment in response to El Salvador’s announcement on Tuesday that they would break diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
	•	I introduced an amendment to the FY2019 Defense-LHHS Minibus appropriations bill that would address the growing instability in Venezuela and Nicaragua by requiring the Secretary of Defense, with the Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of State, to report to Congress on the implications that the ongoing crises in both countries have for U.S. national security and regional stability.
Coming up next week...
	•	My staff will host Mobile Office Hours next week to assist constituents with federal casework issues in their communities. More information and locations near you here.

Time Flies -  
It's hard to believe that we're almost to the end of August, and the House is about to resume its calendar in Washington, D.C. I've enjoyed my time in the district, meeting with many constituents and businesses in our communities. Arizona's Fifth District is a special place, and I am so fortunate to represent this district in Congress. 
Give Them Hope 
￼ 
Today on the podcast, I interviewed Laura McLinn, mother of Jordan McLinn - one of the faces and heroes of the Right to Try cause. Over the past couple of years, I had the opportunity to get to know Laura and Jordan as they both frequented our Nation's Capital to advocate for this vital legislation. It was an honor to work with them and to talk to Laura again about her journey through this process. I hope you will listen and be inspired. Click this link or the logo above to listen. 
￼ 
Special thanks again to all of the champions of Right to Try - the patients and their families. I was privileged to work alongside of Senator Ron Johnson and Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick to GIVE THEM HOPE. 
Support Our Border Patrol Agents 
￼ 
Yesterday, the National Border Patrol Council released a letter of support for my bill, the Fund and Complete the Border Wall Act. One of the key components of the legislation is to open up additional funding for our Border Patrol agents, giving them the necessary resources they need to do their jobs in the field. Read my press release, which includes the letter.

The Contact Lens Rule is cumbersome to prescribers and patients.

August Recess 
This week, I participated in a fascinating space conference, hosted by Arizona State University. Thank you to ASU and Michael Crow for the hospitality. I was privileged to moderate a panel discussion with my colleagues about NASA University-Led Missions. We had a good conversation about what we can do to ensure that our Arizona universities are able to continue to compete for NASA missions. These schools, and others throughout the country, have historically been very successful at bringing missions to fruition on time and under budget.

FACT: All North Dakota Families Deserve Access to Affordable Health Care
￼
Last week in Bismarck, I sat down with North Dakota families and individuals who could be devastated with the prospect of losing access to health care coverage due to the administration's efforts to take away health care protections for those with pre-existing conditions.
FIGHTING FOR NORTH DAKOTANS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it will not actively defend in court critical health care protections for those with pre-existing conditions such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, or pregnancy. Without affordable health insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions, over 300,000 North Dakotans like Karalee, Annelise, Chris, and Sam could lose access to affordable health care or see their premiums skyrocket. Last week in Bismarck, I brought together families and children with pre-existing conditions to hear about how important it is for them to get reliable health coverage. Click here to hear more from our North Dakota neighbors about why affordable health care coverage is so important. In my recent op-ed, read the story of Kathryn and her daughter, Valerie, from Mandan. And in a podcast interview with Politico's Dan Diamond this week, I spoke about the need to protect those with pre-existing conditions and promote stronger access to high-quality health care across our rural communities. 
PUSHING FOR A STRONG, BIPARTISAN FARM BILL THAT WORKS FOR NORTH DAKOTA PRODUCERS AND PROVIDES CERTAINTY AMID A TRADE WAR. The first official meeting of the Farm Bill conference committee— on which I'm one of nine U.S. senators  taking part in negotiations— will take place on September 5. I'm working hard to make sure we have a final Farm Bill completed before the current bill expires at the end of September, as I pointed out in my op-ed in the Grand Forks Herald. Earlier this month, I met with North Dakota farmers, ranchers, commodity groups, and community leaders in Rugby to continue my discussions across the state about my ongoing work on the 2018 Farm Bill, the priorities for North Dakota agriculture that I successfully secured in the bipartisan Senate Farm Bill, and to hear concerns from farmers and manufacturers about the impacts of the administration's escalating trade war. Read more about my Rugby discussion in the Pierce County Tribune, and read my Medium Post on the concrete and commonsense actions I'm taking to help protect our state's crop and livestock producers from the negative impacts of a trade war.   
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING ABOUT THE ESCALATING TRADE WAR: ""As farmers we understand that we need to get more equitable trade, but we feel like we’re really the pawn in the administration’s negotiation. What is the goal? It certainly does not feel like we’re winning right now when we look at what’s happened to soybean prices, specifically in North Dakota where our soybeans go to China.” - Ryan Pederson, Vice President, North Dakota Soybean Growers Association 
 
￼
On Monday, I helped host Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson to view the first civil beyond visual line of sight flight to be conducted from Grand Sky aviation park. As a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I pushed the FAA to approve the two-year Certificate of Authorization to help strengthen North Dakota’s role in the development of UAS research, training, and integration.
ON MONDAY, I JOINED AIR FORCE SECRETARY HEATHER WILSON IN GRAND FORKS. It was an honor to help host Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson view Grand Sky Business and Aviation Park's historic first civil beyond visual line of sight test flight. The demonstration reinforces that Grand Forks continues to be a world class unmanned aerial systems (UAS) innovation hub, and on Monday morning I spoke to UAS industry leaders about how North Dakota will continue to lead the nation in UAS development. Additionally, I had a great visit at Grand Forks Air Force Base with Secretary Wilson, where we met with base officials and were updated on base operations and the ongoing Global Hawk UAS mission that provides essential intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance to combatant commanders across the globe that keeps American families strong and safe. Click here to read an Air Force Magazine article from earlier this year that details how I pushed for the Grand Sky lease in collaboration with the Air Force.   
PODCAST— HOW IMPORTANT IS THE FARM BILL TO NORTH DAKOTA? On the latest episode of my podcast, ""The Hotdish,"" I interview Tom Vilsack— former Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Governor of Iowa— and Ryan Pederson— a North Dakota farmer and Vice President of the North Dakota Soybean Growers Association. Together, we talk about discuss the 2018 Farm Bill’s wide-ranging impact on rural America, from crop insurance and safety net programs to rural development and nutrition assistance. Vilsack and Pederson also shared their concerns about the administration’s trade war and the economic uncertainty it is causing farmers and ranchers.Click here to listen.  
MAKING SURE THE VOICES OF WORKERS & RETIREES ARE HEARD. After the fifth Joint Pensions Committee hearing in July, I wanted to give workers and retirees from around the country a platform to share their stories and explain how the multiemployer pension crisis will impact them and their families if Congress doesn’t act. On Friday, I facilitated a Facebook live in Fargo  to make sure folks in North Dakota have the same opportunity to share their stories about how devastating it would be for them to lose their pensions. And as a member of the 16-person bipartisan committee tasked with solving this crisis, I’m pushing for my Butch Lewis Act to be part of the legislative fix to this mess.

Dear Friends, 
The Senate has been hard at work this August. This week we passed a comprehensive measure to fund the government in the areas of defense, education, health, human services and labor. 
With the passage of this legislation we’re preparing for the future with critical investments in our military, education and job training, and health care. 
I introduced two amendments that were included in the final measure. One amendment was to fund the National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System. This system, which will be conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, will help researchers collect information to advance research on Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and other neurological diseases that affect so many lives. The system originally passed as part of the 21st Century Cures Act, which became law in 2016, but this portion of the bill still required funding, and I’m pleased we’ve reached this important step. 
I also introduced an amendment that was included in the final legislation to address a recent Reuters report about lead poisonings and dangerous lead levels in housing on U.S. Army installations, including Fort Benning in Georgia, that is potentially endangering military families. Additional information on my efforts on this front is below, but our military families should not have to worry about their safety due to lead-based paint problems in their military housing. I’m glad to be taking further steps to address this issue to prevent lead poisoning and protect our military families and children going forward.
With the funding measure we passed yesterday by a vote of 85-7, we’re delivering on the promises we made to our service members to give them a pay raise and equip them with the training and resources necessary to confront threats and protect our national security. We’re also directing more funding to helping workers acquire the skills they need for 21st century jobs and to fighting the growing opioid epidemic that has already claimed too many lives.
These resources will make a difference for our Georgia communities. I’m pleased that Congress is diligently working to fulfill its commitment to fund the government through individual measures that help direct and prioritize our spending. The Senate has this year passed bills containing more than 90 percent of annually appropriated federal spending on time and under regular order. In the past, I’ve shared my concerns about Congress being forced to pass massive “omnibus” spending bills at the last minute to prevent the government from shutting down. Returning to regular order in the budget and appropriations process is essential to restoring political and fiscal responsibility in Congress.
The measures will now move to a committee to work out differences between the Senate and House-passed funding measures.
Protecting our Military Families
Last week, after reading a recent Reuters report about lead poisonings and dangerous lead levels in military housing, I sent a bipartisan letter to U.S. Army Secretary Mark Esper on August 17, raising concerns over the report. We also asked that the secretary provide a detailed briefing about what the Army is doing to keep military families safe and what the Army needs from Congress to address this problem.
Two measures passed this week to also help address potentially dangerous lead levels on military bases as part of the funding bill for our nation’s defense.
First, I filed an amendment with Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., and several other senators from both parties to require the Government Accountability Office to report on the monitoring and remediation of lead and verifiable compliance with lead exposure limits in military housing.
Second, I cosponsored another amendment to require that children who reside on military installations undergo blood testing for lead during both their 12- and 24-month wellness checks. Both of these amendments were included in the final passed legislation. 
The recent reports regarding lead poisoning in some military housing units is disturbing and must absolutely be corrected. Our military families sacrifice greatly in service to our country, and it is our responsibility to do everything we can to ensure their safety, especially in homes the military provides for them. In addition to the information we’ve requested from the U.S. Army to ensure proper treatment, remediation and accountability plans moving forward, these amendments will help us learn as much as we can about this dangerous exposure to prevent future poisoning and protect our military families going forward.

	•	We’re continuing to work in the Senate to confirm nominees to our nation’s courts. Since Jan. 3, 2017, we’ve confirmed a total of 53 judicial nominees who will have an impact on our courts for years to come. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has also taken the necessary steps to secure a Senate confirmation vote soon on Judge Stan Baker of St. Simons Island, Ga., to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, where he has served as magistrate judge since Feb. 3, 2015.
￼
	•	During our Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Tuesday, I questioned Wess Mitchell, assistant secretary for the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs at the U.S. State Department, on the importance of full funding of the National Defense Authorization Act and on our anti-nuclear proliferation efforts, specifically with regard to Russia. I also requested an update on the identification of warheads and he offered a later classified briefing on that issue, which is vital to verification and enforcement of international arms control treaties. I also questioned him on the continued engagement and manipulation in Syria by Russia and Iran.
	•	On Thursday, I joined 15 senators in a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin applauding the department for reimposing a wave of sanctions on the Iranian regime and affirming Congressional support for the department’s maximum pressure campaign. We also urged the department to disconnect the Central Bank of Iran from the global banking system. Further, we expressed that we hope that one day the Iranian people will have a government that represents their interests and invests in their needs, rather than funneling money toward developing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, financing terrorism, committing human rights atrocities, and oppressing its citizens.
	•	On Thursday, I participated in the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee's hearing on prioritizing medical cures at the National Institutes of Health. I questioned Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, about gene therapy to address neurological diseases and congratulated him on the “National Institutes of Hope” program initiative to help spread the mission of the agency. I admire the agency’s work on these programs and their brain initiatives, which is an area I believe we should be investing in to help the millions of Americans affected by neurological and other rare diseases.
What’s on Tap?
Next week, the Senate is expected to continue its work on confirming the president’s nominees to judgeships and key positions in the administration.

Dear  ,   Thank you for signing up to receive my email newsletter. These newsletters will cover a variety of topics, including events happening in northeast Indiana, legislation being considered in Congress, and my perspective on current issues. My hope is to keep you updated and informed on how issues in Washington may impact our region. I welcome your feedback.  
Thanks for reading, ￼  Jim Banks Member of Congress Indiana's Third District 
Letter Urging Farm Bill Conferees to Repeal WOTUS
The Waters of the United States rule, better known as WOTUS, is harmful to farmers and agricultural producers in Indiana and across the country.  This rule gives unelected bureaucrats at the EPA the power to broadly interpret what is a navigable waterway. This rule can be interpreted in a way where even a puddle can be considered a navigable waterway subject to federal regulation.  I am proud to represent nearly 12,000 farms in northeast Indiana, and each and every one of these operations could be subject to this overreaching rule. 
On Wednesday, I led a group of 50 House colleagues in sending a letter to House and Senate members of the 2018 Farm Bill conference committee urging them to include my amendment to permanently repeal WOTUS in the final bill.

Honoring the Life of Charly Butcher
Last week, northeast Indiana lost broadcasting legend and beloved WOWO radio host Charly Butcher. 
I am heartbroken about his passing, and I will forever cherish the moments I spent with Charly, both on and off air. Our entire region mourns his loss, but his irreplaceable voice and legacy will live on for generations to come. 
I offer my deepest condolences to Charly’s wife Sarah, his three children, his extended family and his colleagues at WOWO. 
During a special show on WOWO, I reflected on our time together on-air and explained how I’ll miss our off-the-air conversations most. Click here to listen to the full interview. 
Letter to FBI Regarding Chinese Spy on Feinstein’s Staff
The American public recently learned that Senator Diane Feinstein (CA) employed a Chinese spy while leading the Senate Intelligence Committee. This individual worked on her staff for nearly 20 years and served as her driver when she was in San Francisco. 
I recently sent a letter to the Director of the FBI requesting details on the threat posed by Sen. Feinstein’s staffer who was reporting to Chinese officials. There are far more questions than answers at this point.

Friend-   As we approach the end of another summer week, I wanted to share some meetings I had this week.   ￼   I was in Evesham to meet with law enforcement officials, families who have lost loved ones, and recovery advocates to discuss efforts to bring more resources to our community to fight addiction. This crisis is bigger than one of us, but it is not bigger than all of us. As the co-chair of the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force, this is one of my top priorities in Congress and I am grateful for the law enforcement officials, elected officials, and recovery advocates who are doing so much to help so many locally.   ￼   Recently, residents of Brick Township, mostly seniors, experienced over eight inches of rain in a matter of hours. The water rose fast and flooded over 100 homes forcing dozens of families out of their homes. I’m grateful to Ocean County Sheriff Michael Mastronardy for the invitation to meet with residents in Brick. I am committed to helping in any way that I can, and am thankful to all the volunteers who have been helping those affected.   We can accomplish much in Washington if we are willing to work together on the issues that matter to our community. I won’t ever be blinded by partisanship and I refuse to take part in the partisan dysfunction that prevents progress. If I can ever be of any assistance, or if you would like to sign up for email updates about my efforts in Congress, please visit my website: http://macarthur.house.gov.    Thank you,   ￼

 Friends,  
 It's been another great week of stopping through the Big First communities as I continue my Community Coffee tour. Our stops this week took us from Goodland to Hoxie and Downs to St. Mary's. I had the privilege of meeting a 103-year-old resident in Downs and catching up with a young lady I delivered more than two decades ago who is now doing great work in her community.  I also got to meet with the Hardesty family, and hear their story. Carl Hardesty's wife was deported earlier this yea, Mr. Hardesty was struggling to get her back into the states when he turned to our office for help. Our caseworker Bonnie was able to take the stress and hassle off of Mr. Hardesty and expedite his wife's return and paperwork. Our staff is always here to help, I am very proud of our team!
During my stops, we discussed national security and rural development. We also talked about the Farm Bill and the need to deliver security and stability to our agriculture markets and communities.    Today I finish in Jetmore where I will celebrate the official opening of the ""Kansas Stories of the Vietnam War"" exhibit, a collaborative effort between Jetmore Public Library and the Humanities Kansas Foundation, that gives voice and support to the men and women who bravely served our country. As a former Army reservist and a son and brother of veterans, I applaud efforts to share soldiers' stories and allow the public an opportunity to learn more about our country's history.    Tomorrow I will have another coffee in Ellsworth at 12:00 at the Ellsworth Museum. I hope to see you there! If you can't make it on Saturday, we still have a few more community coffees left. On Monday, at 10 a.m. we'll host a coffee at the Centennial Homestead in Washington County. Then head to Emporia on Wednesday, and Lincoln next Saturday, September 1st.   Click HERE to see the remaining community coffees.

Salina couple reunited
￼ 
(Click the thumbnail above or read the full story HERE) 
  
In July our office received a letter from Mr. Hardesty’s daughter who shared her father’s ongoing case with USCIS.  Mr. Hardesty, 72 years old, had been trying to reunite with his wife, Maria, who was deported in April. He had spent more than $10,000 in legal fees for his wife to attain legal status over the past four years without success. With his health failing, Mr. Hardesty was losing hope. In June, their attorney filed all of the proper paperwork for Maria to be here legally. However, the normal processing times for these applications can take two years or longer.  Once our office opened the case, our caseworker Bonnie worked with USCIS and the State Department to expedite her petition to re-apply for her admission into the states. Within just a few weeks, our team received a favorable decision on his wife's return. Maria returned to Salina August 13th and has since applied for a permanent resident card in hopes of obtaining citizenship.  Yesterday, the Hardesty's stopped by our Salina office to meet with me and express their gratitude. I am so proud of our staff that works hard every day to help Kansans. And especially in Mr. Hardesty's case, reunite families. We are here to HELP! It was great to meet with them yesterday and highlight a great success story. 
FHSU awarded grant to expand access 
to new technology
￼
Today it was announced that Fort Hays State University had been selected for a federal leadership grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. This money will help support the university's efforts to develop a modular smart classroom kit that will provide access to new technology and teaches data literacy. This morning I was honored to join FHSU in their celebration. This kit will make it possible for smaller institutions, particularly in rural areas, to utilize smart classroom technology without significant investments of time, money, or building renovation, thereby promoting digital literacy and inclusion for rural residents.   I have long been an advocate for early exposure to technology, STEM, and computer science education. This program will allow FHSU to support and enhance the opportunities and technology of educational institutions across the district. 
Expanding care in Smith Center
￼
￼ 
On Wednesday, I spent the morning in Smith Center celebrating two excellent health care milestones.   I was honored to be part of the official ribbon cutting ceremony for the community's new skilled nursing and assisted living facility, SunPorch. And received a tour of the brand new Smith County Memorial Hospital.  Both of these facilities utilized USDA Rural Development loans that helped get the projects off the ground and offer members in their community quality health care.  While in Smith Center, we hosted a morning Roundtable discussion with leaders from the Kansas Hospital Association and North-Central Kansas Hospital to discuss a variety of issues that are impacting their communities and their care.  
USAID has awarded $14 million to KSU
￼
It was an honor to join my Alma Mater, Kansas State University in announcing the new grant dollars they've been awarded for their innovation labs.   USAID gave $14 million to Kansas State University to extend the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Collaborative Research in Sorghum and Millet for five years as it develops heartier varieties of sorghum and pearl millet that can withstand heat and drought. USAID has also awarded $3 million to the University to continue the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for the Reduction of Post-Harvest Loss for three years as it develops technologies and approaches for reducing crop loss and contamination during storage. In addition to these two Feed the Future Innovation Labs, Kansas State University also leads labs focused on wheat genomics and sustainable and efficient improvement of agricultural production.  These programs do a fantastic job of finding ways to advance agriculture innovation and feed our growing world. I am proud to support both USAID and K-State's work in agriculture. 
 
Meeting with Kansas Veterans
￼
We have nearly 50,000 veterans currently living in the district, and I am proud of the work Congress has done to better care for our veterans and improve the oversight and accountability within the VA medical system. 
 Thank you to the Stockton-area Veterans who came out to speak with me this week about our VA system and other issues impacting our communities.

Dear Friends, 
I hope you're having a great week. Before the weekend starts off, I wanted to get you caught up on a few important things going on in both Wisconsin and in Washington.
Our Wisconsin Economy Continues To Grow 
Great news for our growing Wisconsin economy: our unemployment rate has been below three percent for six. straight. months.  This is a big deal. Prior to last year, Wisconsin's unemployment rate had NEVER fallen below three percent. And now it has been below the mark for half a year.   Click HERE or the image below to ""like"" and SHARE on the good news on Facebook! 
￼ 
 Combatting The Opioid Crisis   The opioid crisis continues to devastate our families and our communities. Wisconsin has made major strides in combatting this crisis- including giving back more than 63,000 pounds of unused prescriptions in last May's Drug Take Back Day.  That was the third highest total in the nation- behind only California and Texas, and more than Minnesota, Michigan, and Iowa COMBINED.  Sadly, there is still much more work to do to defeat the scourge of opioids. I recently spoke with Charles Payne of Fox Business about the need to have an all-the-above approach to addressing the opioid crisis in America.

 Internship Opportunity In Our Nation's Capital 
Attention college students or recent grads: my Washington DC office is now accepting applications for Fall internships. It's a great way to serve your community and get involved in the political process.   For more information on the internship, click HERE or the photo below. Also be sure to share these opportunities with any interested students!

Hensarling in the Wall Street Journal:
Under Sen. Warren's Bill, We Would All Become Equally Poor
Lest anyone question whether socialism continues its rise in the Democratic Party, they should look no further than Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s “Companies Shouldn’t Be Accountable Only to Shareholders” (op-ed, Aug. 15) in which she rhetorically asks, “What do Americans get in return for [corporate America]? Outside of automobiles, smartphones, lifesaving drugs, airlines, hospitals, philanthropy and the highest standard of living in the world, what have American corporations ever done for us?
Sen. Warren’s “Accountable Capitalism Act” represents one of the greatest expropriations of private property rights in our history, and arguably the most expansive command and control proposal ever presented by the Democratic Party.
She proposes to force owners of successful companies to cede “at least” 40% of their ownership rights to employees and require corporate directors to consider the interest of “all major corporate stakeholders.” Does anyone doubt that 40% will soon become 51%? Or that government will both define and dictate acceptable corporate behavior to their favored stakeholders? Capital won’t be risked when investors know they will lose control of that capital.
Sen. Warren claims this is necessary to combat income inequality, stagnant wages and the rich getting richer. But the majority of America is directly or indirectly invested in corporations through pension plans, 401(k)s and personal savings. Furthermore, we shouldn’t be measured by how much we take from those at the top, but instead by how we lift those from the bottom. Thanks in large part to corporate America, the bottom 10% in America live better than roughly 70% of the rest of the world. Regarding stagnant wages, 90% of working Americans now receive greater take home pay due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which she vigorously opposed. Throw in the deregulatory agenda, and wages are growing at their fastest pace in almost a decade.
If Sen. Warren’s efforts are successful, she will certainly achieve her goal of ending income inequality. We will all become equally poor.

8/24/18 14:15,Plans this weekend?,"￼ 

Dear Friend, 
I hope you're having a great week! I just finished meeting with public officials in Honduras, and am on the way to El Salvador and then Guatemala on my trip this weekend to identify root causes and areas we can collaborate to combat transnational gangs, human trafficking and illegal immigration.  
Here are a few of the highlights from my week: 
The crisis along our Southern border will only continue unless we actively work with our allies in Central America to find shared solutions. Productive discussion with public officials in Honduras as our countries work together to combat human trafficking, drug smuggling and corruption.   
￼ 
With a good education, our kids will be empowered to change the world. This is why I continuously advocate for quality education and increased educational resources for communities throughout TX-23. Learn more in my latest Hurd on the Hill column.  
￼ 
Plans this weekend? I can't think of a better way to celebrate the 102nd birthday of our National Park Service tomorrow than by visiting one of TX-23's eight incredible national parks.  
￼ 
In case you missed it: 60 TX-23 households now have sewer service for the first time. I was happy to support the Lower Valley Water District in East El Paso in receiving grant funding from the North American Development Bank for much-needed water service improvements.  
￼ 
Best of luck to all of our TX-23 students who started the new school year this week! If you didn't see my Throwback Thursday Instagram post, here's a glimpse of me in Middle School days. 
￼ 
As always, please don't hesitate to reach out to my office with any questions or concerns. For further updates on my work for you, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube at @HurdontheHill, and be sure to share this email with your family and friends! 
Have a wonderful weekend!

8/24/18 14:14,What Are Republicans Hiding About Judge Kavanaugh?,"The Durbin Report: A message from Senator Richard J. Durbin
￼ 


Fellow Illinoisan, 
Yesterday, I met with Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court.   
Judge Kavanaugh had the opportunity to respond to a letter I sent him 11 years ago about his testimony to the Judiciary Committee in 2006. Despite his sworn testimony in 2006 that he was never involved in “questions about the rules governing detention of combatants” while working in the White House, he confirmed to me that he was involved with internal Bush Administration discussions about litigation and policy regarding the detention of enemy combatants. By any reasonable understanding, his 2006 statement was misleading at best.   
Fundamental questions about the accountability of the President may soon come before the Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh was an aggressive proponent of investigating President Bill Clinton, but changed his view after working for President George W. Bush. He would not say whether he believed a sitting president was subject to a subpoena or criminal indictment. The American people need answers to these questions.
￼ 
DURBIN DISCUSSES NOMINATION OF JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH IN THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
Lastly, the Trump Administration and Senate Republicans have refused to disclose any documents from the 35 months that Judge Kavanaugh spent as Staff Secretary in the White House, a time when many controversial issues of constitutional importance were debated and decided. He acknowledged that he was involved in many of these issues, including same-sex marriage, abortion, executive power, detainees, torture, Supreme Court nominations, warrantless wiretapping, and more. Time and again, he would not rule out that there are documents about his work on these issues—documents that are being hidden from the American people. 
It is clear to me that the Senate should not hold confirmation hearings on Judge Kavanaugh unless his full record has been made available for review. There are simply too many missing documents and unanswered questions about this nominee for the Senate to credibly consider him for a lifetime appointment on the highest court in the land. It would be an abdication of the Senate’s constitutional responsibility of “advice and consent” to consider Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination without first obtaining these documents and answers. What is in these documents that Judge Kavanaugh does not want America to see? 
This is a nomination to replace the swing vote on the Supreme Court. Too much is at stake for the Senate to get this wrong.   Sincerely,  
U.S. Senator Dick Durbin

8/24/18 14:00,Houston After Harvey,"￼
August 24, 2018 
Houston After Harvey   
 


Dear Neighbor,

Almost one year ago, Hurricane Harvey made landfall on the Texas coast and wreaked havoc on Houston and the lives of millions of Texans.

While Houston was experiencing devastating floods, we also saw the best of our Texan spirit as our communities came together to help one another. I am grateful to all our first responders, to the people of Louisiana, and all those across the country that risked their lives to help our communities.

In the year since Harvey hit, my top priority in Washington has been getting federal assistance to my neighbors impacted by the storm. 

￼

As the only appropriator from Southeast Texas, I was proud to spearhead the record $141 billion in flood relief in the House, including nearly $5 billion for flood prevention for Texas. This is enough money to fund all federally authorized flood control projects in Harris County, as well as the study required to determine the best long-term solutions to protect the areas upstream and downstream of the Addicks and Barker Reservoirs. It also ensures that the Army Corps of Engineers prioritizes the construction of projects in Southeast Texas. This means that I secured enough money to completely finish Brays Bayou, White Oak Bayou, Hunting Bayou, and Clear Creek at full federal expense. There’s also enough money to speed up the federally authorized projects in Harris County and determine future projects to enhance our regional flood control network, including enhancing the capacity of the Addicks and Barker Reservoirs. 

I’ve also been working to help families receive rental assistance after Harvey. Under current law, FEMA is required to provide disaster relief to families affected by natural disasters. However, FEMA has been imposing a 30 percent rule that deems many homeowners who need help as “too wealthy” to qualify for housing assistance. FEMA says that if your post-disaster housing costs are equal to or less than 30 percent of your gross household income, you are ineligible for financial assistance for a temporary place to rent while your home is being repaired. Recently, the Homeland Security Committee on Appropriations unanimously adopted my amendment to repeal this FEMA rule. My amendment has not yet been signed into law, but I will continue to do everything I can to see that this policy is changed.

Additionally, Congressman Gene Green (TX-29) and I recently sent a letter to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Brock Long urging him to extend the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) deadline by an additional six months to submit proof of loss for claims resulting from Hurricane Harvey. The NFIP program cannot leave any policyholders impacted by Hurricane Harvey behind. An extension to allow more time for Texans to finalize their claims is critical, and I will continue pushing for this change. 

Your safety and security is my highest priority. I am working every day to ensure that Houston will become more resilient to future storms and better than before Harvey. 

As we all continue to get back to our normal routines, please know how very grateful I am for the honor and privilege to represent you in the United States House.

Sincerely,  ￼  John Culberson

                                                 Dear Friends,  I just returned from a trip overseas for the House Intelligence Committee, having met with government, military, and intelligence officials in various countries. I also had the opportunity to meet with U.S. troops stationed abroad, whose patriotism and high morale are deeply inspiring. The trip included visits with the Army's 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry and the Marine Corps Black Sea Rotational Force at the Mihail Kogalniceanu (MK) Air Base in Romania, a key logistical hub for U.S. forces in the Black Sea region. I also went to the country of Georgia to observe Noble Partner 2018, a multinational military exercise led by the U.S. and Georgian militaries. Pictures of those visits are below.

It's been a busy August working in our district. As I travel around the North Country meeting with constituents, community leaders, and small business owners, my offices continue working on your behalf. I wanted to take a moment to share with you some important highlights from the August district work period, in case you missed them.
Hosting President Trump at Fort Drum 
￼
It was an honor to host President Trump at Fort Drum as he signed the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) into law. This year’s NDAA contains the largest pay raise for our troops in nine years, and includes several provisions I authored to support military families and wounded servicemembers. This bipartisan bill also strengthens our military readiness, which will help military installations around the country – including Fort Drum. As a Member of the House Intelligence Committee, I am also pleased that this legislation includes several provisions to counter Russian aggression and to impose new sanctions on the Russian arms industry. Click here to read more about this month's visit by President Trump and about this year's NDAA.  
Strengthening our North Country Workforce 
￼ 
I hosted Franklin County leaders for a roundtable focused on workforce development at the FEH-BOCES in Malone. Since arriving in Congress, I’ve made over one hundred business and school visits across our district, and one of the most common issues business leaders tell me they struggle with is the ability to find skilled labor here in the North Country. Working with feedback from these leaders, and from students across our district, I co-wrote the first major update to federal Career and Technical Education programs in over a decade. 
This bipartisan bill – the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act – updates our CTE policies to empower state and local community leaders, align training with in-demand jobs, and increase transparency and accountability in our federal programs. I was pleased to see President Trump sign this important initiative into law. I thank all of our attendees for a productive discussion on ways we can continue to develop our North Country workforce. Click here to learn more about our roundtable and my work in Congress on Career and Technical Education. 
Roundtable on Northern Border Issues 
￼ 
As the Representative of a Northern Border District, I know that the economies of Canada and the North Country are deeply connected. I hosted a roundtable in Plattsburgh to discuss issues that impact both sides of our Northern Border, such as trade, tariffs, and our shared tourism economy. In Congress, I have been proud to lead on bipartisan initiatives to strengthen our partnership with Canada. I led the legislative effort to solidify the U.S.-Canadian preclearance agreement to increase commerce and strengthen border security between our two nations. I have also introduced bipartisan legislation that directs U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to hire, train, and assign 5,000 new CBP officers and 350 support personnel at our ports of entry. Additionally, I am cosponsoring the PRINT Act to suspend new tariffs currently being imposed on Canadian groundwood paper – the primary source of paper used by newspapers in our district.   
Thank you to North Country Chamber of Commerce CEO, Garry Douglas, and to all of our attendees for participating in our Northern Border Roundtable. I'll keep working to further strengthen our special relationship with Canada and to improve commerce and tourism between our two nations. 
Fighting the Opioid Epidemic in the North Country and Beyond 
￼ 
I hosted Saratoga County leaders for a roundtable focused on combating the heroin and opioid epidemic that is devastating communities across the North Country and the Nation. The opioid epidemic touches our communities, our homes, and our families in ways that have grave effects on everyday people and everyday lives. Thank you to all of the community leaders who participated in our productive roundtable discussion. To learn more about our roundtable in Wilton, and about my work in Congress to end addiction, click here. 
￼ 
I’m grateful to constituents like Bob Dean from Queensbury who continue to share their personal stories with me as we work to pass further legislation to end the heroin and opioid epidemic. I invite you to take a moment to hear Bob's story and to learn about my work in Congress to end addiction and promote recovery. Click here or on the image above to learn more. 
Protecting Lake Champlain 
￼ 
I toured the site of the former Willsboro Dam with representatives from the Lake Champlain Basin Program (LCBP) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). With the assistance of the LCBP and USFWS, the Willsboro Dam was removed in 2015 – effectively reopening over 100 miles of the Boquet River Watershed to Atlantic salmon and improving the river’s water quality and natural flood resilience. I proudly crossed party lines to save the LCBP from elimination and led the fight to nearly double LCBP funding in the recent House appropriations bill. Click here to read more about my visit.  
Adirondack 1892 Visit 
￼ 
I visited the Adirondack 1892 Home Store in Malone this month. Adirondack 1892 sells furniture with a focus on American-made and local products. They’re a welcome addition to the Malone community and I appreciated our discussion about issues facing small businesses. Thanks for having me!
Almanzo Wilder Farm  
￼ 
The Almanzo Wilder Farm and Homestead in Malone welcomes visitors from across the country looking to experience 19th Century farm life. As the childhood home of Almanzo Wilder, husband to Laura Ingalls Wilder, the Almanzo Wilder Farm and Homestead also holds an important place in literary history. Thank you for hosting me this month, and for your continued promotion of North Country tourism!
Grant Cottage 
￼ 
Visitors from across the country come to learn about the life and history of President Ulysses S. Grant at Grant Cottage in Wilton. Grant Cottage is a living, breathing museum still arranged as it was when President Grant composed his famous memoirs in the North Country. Thank you to the staff at Grant Cottage for hosting me, and for all the work you do to strengthen our tourism economy and share our history! 
Mountain Lake Services Annual Picnic 
￼ 
Mountain Lake Services has been enriching the lives of the developmentally disabled in Essex County for over 50 years. We’re grateful for the work they do to provide support and services to countless individuals and their families. Thank you to Mountain Lake Services for inviting me to their annual picnic in Port Henry to celebrate their impressive achievements!

8.24.18 Helping Public Servants Get Student Loan Debt Relief
Dear Friend, 
Public servants across Virginia - teachers, social workers, government workers, servicemembers, and others - who take on crushing student loan debt often struggle to make ends meet. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program allows borrowers to eliminate their remaining debt after making years of payments and working in public service for a decade. This program helps us draw the brightest minds into education and other service professions where they can make a big impact.
Yesterday, the Senate passed a bill that includes $350 million in funding for the PSLF program. I had heard from Virginians who thought they were eligible for loan forgiveness, but because of a technical glitch, they were being denied the relief they deserved. I'm proud I was able to get the Senate to pass legislation to help fix that issue, and this additional funding will help those borrowers who were in the wrong payment program remain eligible for loan forgiveness.
For more information on loan forgiveness through the PSLF program >>
This is about supporting the teachers, social workers, military personnel and other public servants who have dedicated their life's work to serving our communities.

Sincerely,
￼
Senator Tim Kaine

Meharry: Trump's affirmative action reversal will mean fewer doctors in black neighborhoods  Tennessean  The leader of Nashville’s historically black medical college said Friday that a Trump Administration decision to roll-back Obama-era affirmative action policies will trigger a domino effect in higher education that will ultimately lead to fewer doctors in many low-income, minority neighborhoods.

It’s been a busy August work period here in Atlanta and in Washington, D.C. I was honored this month to participate in the Mandela Washington Fellowship Summit, several back-to-school events, meetings with local officials and constituents, and a successful telephone town hall. I’ve also held meetings with local businesses and organizations, including visiting a concrete plant, water treatment plant, concrete pipe builders, local broadcasters and discussing issues of the day with citizens concerned about the environment and gun violence and much, much more. 
 
As the summer winds down, I’m looking forward to returning to Washington, D.C. after Labor Day to be your voice on Capitol Hill. 
 
I know for many of you the elephant in room is the news this week that close associates of President Trump were found guilty or plead guilty to federal crimes. They represent the fourth and fifth individuals closely tied to the president who now face possible prison time. Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle – especially my fellow members of the Judiciary Committee – have done nothing to hold the White House accountable. In fact, they have worked diligently to obscure facts and the truth, and protect at all costs a commander-in-chief who is now an “unindicted co-conspirator” in serious crimes. 
 
As developments unfold, I will continue to use my platform on the Judiciary Committee to not only hold the Executive Branch accountable but help bring to justice any individual or agency that is abusing the trust (and funds) of the American people. I also pledge to work in Judiciary to protect the Mueller investigation, so they can finish their important work.

Trump Signs Tester's 18th Bill into Law
New Law Protects East Rosebud for Future Generations
￼
 
President Donald Trump has signed U.S. Senator Jon Tester's 18th bill into law.  The East Rosebud Protection Act is the latest piece of bipartisan legislation that Tester has introduced, spearheaded through a divided Congress, and gotten to the President's desk.  ""Just like every other bill that I have written and the President has signed into law, protecting the East Rosebud started with face-to-face conversations with Montanans,"" Tester said. ""Whether it is holding the VA accountable, protecting our streams and landscapes, upgrading equipment for firefighters, or cutting red tape for local businesses, I have been willing to work with anyone to get things done for Montana.""  The East Rosebud Protection Act will preserve 20 miles of the East Rosebud Creek in south-central Montana as part of the Wild and Scenic River System.

Dear Friend,  Hearing from Arizonans about important issues and challenges is essential to my work getting results for our state. That’s why I recently met with Arizona veterans and businesses to listen and continue our work serving veterans and military families and helping local businesses grow and succeed.  At a meeting with my Veterans Advisory Council, a group of over 20 veterans from Arizona’s Ninth Congressional District, we discussed our work in Congress to improve the benefits and care provided to Arizona veterans. Earlier this year, the Council recommended we cosponsor and support a bill to provide VA benefits to ‘Blue Water’ Vietnam veterans. With their support we took action, cosponsored the bill, and helped pass it through the House of Representatives.
￼      ￼

More than 40 years after his service to our nation, we helped a local Vietnam veteran receive the service medals he had earned. I had the honor of presenting him these medals at this month’s Council meeting.

￼

I also continued our Jobs Tour in Chandler, where I met with employees at ArmorWorks. This local business manufactures armor and protective technologies for our military, keeping American servicemembers safe while supporting jobs right here in Arizona. During the visit, we discussed how we can help Arizona businesses create more good-paying jobs and grow our state’s economy. 
 
￼      ￼

I am honored to serve in Congress on behalf of Arizona families like yours. Staying in touch and listening to your questions and concerns helps inform our work. Together, we are cutting through Washington dysfunction to get things done for our state.

If there is an issue that concerns you, please let us know by clicking this link or by calling our Phoenix office: 602-956-2285. Be sure to stay connected through our Facebook and Twitter accounts, and let us know how we can be of service.
Sincerely,

8/23/18 16:19,Constituent Inbox: Civility in politics," 
 
 
  
￼ 
￼
￼
￼
Hello, and welcome to the office. I’ve received a lot of mail recently about civility in politics.
Sadly, recent political discourse is increasingly dominated by shaming, shouting, and harassment. 
As elected officials, we have a responsibility to encourage civil discourse and we should lead by example – that’s my belief. I believe that public servants should hold themselves to the highest standards of behavior. Disagreements are inevitable in free societies, but these disagreements don’t need to coarsen our debate. Civil debate can be actually very enlightening. 
Although we have a wide variety of political views, at the end of the day, aren’t we all Americans? Think about it. I’m Brad Wenstrup. Thanks for visiting the office.

8/23/18 15:28,back to school,"￼
It's that time of year again: Missourians are heading back to school.




I remember how excited my kids were for the first day of school every year -- and I want every kid in Missouri to be that happy on their first day of school, too.
I'm the proud product of Missouri public education -- and I'm committed to keeping our public schools strong. But that means prioritizing the needs of our students and investing in elementary, secondary, and higher education.
That's why I've fought to fund the bipartisan Secure Rural Schools program, which provides critical assistance to school districts across Missouri. And it's why I'm holding Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos accountable and fighting back on her attempts to undermine the promise of American public education.
I know we can't stop with high school graduation, though.
The average cost of one year of college is now twice what it cost less than 20 years ago. Well, I believe we can -- and must -- do better.
I've always supported programs to make college more affordable and streamline student aid. This year I wrote to the Department of Education to urge them to keep investigating abuses by for-profit schools, and uphold their commitment to hold colleges accountable for misleading, cheating, or defrauding Missouri students. I've fought to maintain funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, improve debt relief and Pell grants, and strengthen campus sexual assault protections.  
Problems in our education system also hurt our seniors and veterans: I've sponsored legislation to prevent garnishment of retirement benefits for decades-old student loans, and fought to protect veterans from predatory, for-profit universities.
This school year, I'm committed to fighting for our kids, whether they're starting kindergarten or freshman year. I won't stop working to make sure they get the support they need to thrive.

  This past May, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer came to visit me in my office in Washington. As I always do when I meet a federal official, I bragged about New Jersey, telling the Secretary about the significant Navy presence in our state, both at the Joint Base and at Picatinny Arsenal.  As I was talking, I thought –I can’t remember the last time we had a Secretary of the Navy visit our bases. 
So at my request, Secretary Spencer agreed to join me for a tour.  (Read the Burlington County Times story on our visit here, or share that story with your Facebook friends here.) 
 I could tell the Secretary walked away from our visit impressed – even  surprised – that so much critical work to keep our military mission-ready is done at land-locked bases in New Jersey.
￼ 
Talking with Navy Secretary Richard Spencer (Right) about outstanding JBMDL team supporting Naval missions. 
  
 ￼ 
Secretary Spencer and I met with New Jerseyans who work at the Joint Packaging, Handling, Storage, and Transportation Complex where guns and ammunition are distributed. 
 I’ve always said that Picatinny Arsenal is a jewel in our national defense, but virtually no one outside of New Jersey knows about it.  So that’s where I took the Secretary first, so he could see how more than 6,000 New Jerseyans are hard at work, developing munitions systems for the Navy.
I told the Secretary that when you’re talking about the sophistication of our military’s weaponry, it’s because of Picatinny. When we’re talking about how you shoot down incoming fire before it ever hits a ship, and the rate of deploying that system, you’re relying on Picatinny. 
 At JBMDL, we stood on a model aircraft carrier runway, where Navy engineers develop everything from systems to launch aircrafts (like EMALS on the left) to advanced arresting gears (which the Navy uses to stop aircrafts when they land on moving carriers). 
￼ 
Together, we watched a demonstration of the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS). 
I also made sure the Secretary knew how serious I was about stopping another Base Realignment and Closure. Another BRAC would not only devastate the region and the 44,000 employees at JBMDL, but it’s also inefficient and doesn’t meet the national security interests of the United States (and okay I may have been sitting in a gunner while telling him…seriously).    I recently worked to ensure the military funding bill, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, not only banned another BRAC this year, but also included a well-deserved pay raise for our dedicated women and men in uniform and the civilian workforce in our state 
  ￼  Speaking to Naval Base Command Leaders about what they need from Washington. On my immediate right, I’m speaking to CAPT Muhammad Muzzafar Kahn, JBMDL Deputy Commander and Naval Support Activity Lakehurst Commander.  On my left is CAPT Kenneth B Sterbenz, PMA-251 (Program manager for Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment Program Office), and on the far left of the picture is CAPT Brad Kidwell, NAVAIR 4.8 Support Equipment/Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment Military Director. 
 As our world grows more complex, and we grapple with a larger array of security challenges around the world, keeping New Jersey’s military installations on the cutting-edge will remain a key focus of mine in the U.S. Senate.  That’s why I’ve secured millions of dollars in critical investments for New Jersey bases, and I fought relentlessly to convince the Air Force to choose JBMDL to receive new KC-46 refueling tankers, one of my proudest achievements.    I want everyone to know that these installations are integral to our nation’s naval defense operations and our national security.  So tell your friends about all the incredible work happening in New Jersey by sharing this story with your Facebook friends here.   As long as I am a United States Senator I will continue to be a relentless advocate for the brave New Jerseyans who serve our country and protect our homeland.    Thank you for all you do to make New Jersey a great place to live, work and raise a family.

 Dear Friend,   After a lifetime of hard work, Rhode Island seniors deserve to live their retirement years with dignity and economic security. That won’t happen if Republicans get their way.  On Monday, I spoke with residents at Rumford Towers where I released a new report prepared by the House Democratic Caucus Seniors Task Force on the long history of Republican attacks on seniors’ earned benefits. The record is clear - Republicans want to bring us back to the days when only some folks could afford to retire and everyone else was on their own.   Democrats know we can do better and that’s why we continue fighting For The People, not the special interests, and making sure that all seniors are able to live their retirement years with dignity and without worry that their basic needs are met here in Rhode Island and across our country.  Last year, I worked with my colleagues to craft a plan that lowered the cost of prescription drugs by allowing Medicare to negotiate with the pharmaceutical industry, cracking down on price gouging, and requiring companies to release data to justify price increases. On Monday, I also outlined the Protecting and Preserving Social Security Act, a bill that I am co-sponsoring which will extend the solvency of Social Security by decades and provide seniors with a stronger cost-of-living adjustment.  When Democrats take the majority this November, we will keep doing everything we can For The People to bring down the cost of prescription drugs and strengthen Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.   NOT A WITCH HUNT   On Tuesday, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort and personal attorney, Michael Cohen were each found guilty of serious offenses against the United States. They join President Trump’s former national security adviser, his deputy campaign chairman, and his foreign policy adviser, each of whom was also convicted of serious crimes. Not since Richard Nixon have we seen a presidential administration this embroiled in corruption.  Most shocking of all, Cohen confirmed under oath that the President of the United States directed him to engage in criminal activity during the presidential campaign. In light of these facts, President Trump needs to come clean and sit down for an interview with Special Counsel Robert Mueller immediately.  On another front, and with complete disregard of duty, the Republicans who control Congress have refused to exercise their constitutional oversight responsibility and have acted more like President Trump’s defense attorneys.  It is crucial that Speaker Ryan call the House back into session to pass legislation that protects the Special Counsel and ensures that he can complete his investigation. While Democrats are united in this effort, we remain in the minority. Our Republican colleagues need to finally do their job and join us in making clear that Special Counsel Mueller will be permitted to finish his work free from political interference.  It’s time to put our country first.  GROUNDBREAKING AT CENTRAL FALLS   I am thrilled to have joined Mayor Diossa, Senator Whitehouse, and state and local elected officials earlier this week for Monday’s groundbreaking in the great city of Central Falls. This event marked a critical milestone in the transformation of a vacant lot into new residential units that will consist of single and two-bedroom apartments.  Under the leadership of Mayor Diossa, Central Falls has gone through an incredible transformation these past few years. The city, once under financial distress and forced to file for bankruptcy, has turned a corner thanks to its leaders in government and the community.  Investing in our communities and making sure there are clean and safe places to live with good schools and reliable infrastructure is so important and exactly what we need to be doing to move our cities, state, and country forward.   I’m proud to have been there on Monday and look forward to seeing more to come from this comeback city.  ￼   NATIONAL HEALTH CENTER WEEK   As part of National Health Center Week, I was honored to celebrate Americas’ Health Centers and receive the Health Center Superhero Award from the Rhode Island Health Center Association this past Monday.  Community health centers are a vital part of our healthcare network by providing high-quality, affordable health care to tens of millions of Americans each year, including hundreds of thousands of Rhode Islanders. Most importantly, they provide critical access to our most vulnerable Americans. As healthcare and the cost of prescription drugs skyrocket we need to remain committed to making sure that everyone is able to access healthcare, regardless of income.  It was my honor to participate in this event, as well as recognize health centers and the people that work in them for the great services they provide to their communities.   As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns, please call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov.  You can also click here to follow my work on Twitter.   Warm Regards, ￼  David Cicilline Member of Congress

Obamacare rates likely to drop next year  The Tennessean  Tennesseans who depend on federally assisted health insurance are likely to have more options and face cheaper prices next year.   Bredesen vs. Blackburn  Nashville Scene An open seat produces Tennessee’s most competitive U.S. Senate race in more than a decade.  Some Tennessee Residents Lack Broadband. Could TVA Become Their New ISP?  WPLN / Nashville Public Radio  Former Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen — and his Republican rival for the U.S. Senate, Congressman Marsha Blackburn — have both been talking up plans to expand broadband access in rural places. But they're pitching two very different solutions. 
Here's what GOP lawmakers are saying – or not saying – about Cohen  CNN Congressional Republicans are largely avoiding speculation that the guilty plea by President Donald Trump's longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen could potentially implicate the President in campaign finance violations. 
Why Michael Cohen Agreed to Plead Guilty—And Implicate the President  The Wall Street Journal Prosecutors had reams of evidence and a long list of counts, which also could have included the lawyer’s wife.  
Trump Praises Manafort, Saying ‘Unlike Michael Cohen’ He ‘Refused to Break’  The New York Times  The president attacked Mr. Cohen as a bad lawyer and said that he had “such respect for a brave man,” a reference to Paul Manafort, who was convicted of tax and bank fraud.  Trump doesn't rule out pardoning Manafort  POLITICO President Donald Trump on Wednesday refused to rule out pardoning his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who was convicted this week on eight counts of tax and bank fraud. 
The Immigration Fight That May Soon Land in the Supreme Court  The Atlantic A DACA ruling from a federal district judge in Texas could conflict with previous orders that have allowed the program to proceed, and, as a result, bring the issue to the Court.  Nashville will vote on 5 charter amendments  The Tennessean The Metro Council voted Tuesday night to add five Metro charter amendments to the Nov. 6 general election.  Smith & Wesson vs. oatmeal on the ballot in Tennessee  The Washington Post  Is fealty to Trump enough?

￼ 


  Around 11:50 am today, I’m going to need you on Facebook Live. I’ve been dismayed by the Trump Administration’s heartless and deliberate plot to sabotage our health care system and rip health care away from millions of Americans. But putting Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court would be President Trump’s greatest act of sabotage yet. 
 That’s because this Administration is arguing in court that protections for pre-existing conditions are unconstitutional, and if that case makes it to the Supreme Court,  Trump and his Republican allies want Kavanaugh – who has decried the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act – to be there.
 As the Trump Administration carries out this campaign of sabotage, my Republican colleagues are engaging in a campaign of silence and complicity – because when they have the power to use their voice to protect millions of patients and families across this nation, and they choose NOT to do so, they are indeed complicit. 
 So join me on Facebook Live around 11:50 am to add your comments and reactions as I hold the Senate Floor to demand we block this nomination.    Our voices are our greatest vehicle for change. This is the time to use them!    Sincerely,

Dear Friend, 

Visits in the 7th District
It has been my privilege to give talks to Rotarians for over a decade throughout the district, so I welcomed the opportunity to speak about Rotarian ethics at the Western Henrico Rotary Club on Monday. I was also grateful for the chance to listen to your concerns and look forward to continuing to hear from my constituents as I travel throughout every county in the district this August. Thank you for having me! 

        ￼    ￼

The small businesses throughout the 7th district are the lifeblood of our economy. I had the opportunity to sit down with NFIB member small business owners in Culpeper. It was great to have a discussion on the successes that have been achieved in rural broadband and the continued work that needs to be done to help our businesses thrive. 

                      ￼
On Tuesday I had the privilege of presenting the Congressional Award to Anneliese Mabie. The Congressional Award is Congress' highest honor for youth. Congratulations Anneliese, keep up the great work! 
     ￼
  
Office Hours
I am dedicated to making sure my constituents concerns are heard. On Monday and Tuesday I sat down with over 50 constituents from Henrico, Culpeper, and Orange counties in continuation with the series of mobile office hours I am holding in all 10 counties this August. As your representative I am here to listen and am willing to have an open-ended dialogue about issues Virginia families are concerned about.

Dear Friend, 
The definition of a crime is “an illegal act or activity.” Entering and staying in our country without going through the proper procedures is a crime. That’s why we call it “illegal” immigration – because it isn’t legal! 
The events of this week are a reminder that the cost of illegal immigration continues to rise on multiple levels – even costing innocent lives. 
We’ve seen this too many times now. Someone comes here illegally and commits a crime like murder or rape or kidnapping. What gets obscured by the heinous act is the fact that that individual is already committing a crime just by being here. The crime perpetrated by that criminal would potentially never be committed in our country were we to strengthen and enforce our immigration laws.  
I’ve always believed that a wall must be built on the border. It’s our first line of defense. We must build it now.  
Both Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) must be given the tools and support necessary to do their job. With a wall in place, our Border Patrol could more easily do their jobs and stop illegals before they get further into the country.  
ICE, an agency that continues to take flak from those who support law-breakers, needs to be able to find, apprehend, and deport those who are here illegally. Earlier this month, a van-load of illegals was apprehended by police near St. Louis. ICE investigated and discovered that nine of those individuals had already been previously deported, some just earlier this year! Obviously, we need to do more before they make it across the border. 
Not only that, but we should also take away any potential benefit of illegally crossing the border. Our law enforcement does an incredible job. We must empower them to continue to do their job. Cities that politicize this issue and operate as “sanctuary cities” must pay a price. We must also make sure that those who employ people are only employing those who are legally allowed to work. We do have a system in place; however, there is no doubt that it needs to be even more stringent.  
Given the events of this week, I think it’s important to reiterate that we must do everything in our power to eradicate illegal immigration. A strong legal immigration system is the best deterrent to illegal immigration. It’s really hard to stomach someone who isn’t supposed to be here murdering someone who should be here. Each time it happens, it’s just another reminder that this problem needs to be addressed sooner rather than later. 
 
Sincerely,
￼ 
Sam Graves

Congressman Al Green’s Statement on Paul Manafort’s Conviction, Michael Cohen’s Guilty Plea, and Impeachment of President Trump 
(Houston, TX) - On Tuesday, August 21, 2018, the world learned that President Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted of 8 financial crimes charges.At nearly the same time, the President’s personal attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to 8 federal charges, implicating the President. To which, Congressman Al Green released the following statement:
“This is a sad time for our country. It’s becoming increasingly clear that the President will have two options: either resign or face impeachment, which does not require the President to have been found guilty of a crime. The framers of the Constitution provided impeachment as the way to remove an unfit President. Hence, the ultimate question isn’t whether the country has a way to remove an unfit President, but rather whether Congress has the will to remove an unfit President. As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. wisely indicated, ‘There comes a time when silence is betrayal.’ Such a time is upon us.”

REVISED: Congressman Al Green’s Statement on Harris County Flood Control Funding 
(Houston, TX) – On Wednesday, August 22, 2018, Congressman Al Green released the following statement regarding local flood control funding:
“A year ago, Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc on the City of Houston, dumping over 9 trillion gallons of water on the Greater Houston Area. Houstonians have made tireless, unwavering efforts to recover. While we showed this Nation and the world that we are #HoustonStrong, we cannot ignore that this city has seen more than its fair share of flooding in the past 5 years alone, and it seems that the damages only get worse. Investing in flood control projects and specifically mitigation allows our community to not only recover from the tragic aftermath of Harvey but mitigate future flood damage. Most importantly, existing federal projects require a local funding match to receive the federal dollars needed to complete these projects.  I support the determination by our local community to invest in its future by protecting property and saving lives.”

NEWS FROM WASHINGTON AND ACROSS WEST TEXAS
Dear Friend, 
During last week’s ‘West Texas Road Trip,’ I had the privilege of visiting with many throughout the western part of the district. See below for a few of our stops and what was discussed. 
My Home 
The Plainview spirit is alive and well. I had a great time spending time with friends at the Plainview Lions Club. Thank you for your dedication to service - you all are true West Texans. 
￼ 
The City of Plainview is led by some of the best. I was glad to hear how the economy is growing here in my hometown! 
￼
There’s nothing like walking the halls of my alma mater, Plainview ISD. Once a bulldog, always a bulldog! I hope everyone had a great first few days back to school. 
￼ 
Community Bank Relationships 
Community banks are an integral part of Main Street America – they make up over 50 percent of banks in rural communities and employ nearly 20,000 people in District 19. Our Republican-led House has taken great strides to roll back onerous and unnecessary regulations so that our community banks can do what they do best – meet the financial needs of their customers and serve their communities, especially our farmers. It is always a pleasure visiting with Hale County folks in Abernathy. Thank you to Abernathy First State Bank for having us.
Immigration Reform 
We had a great discussion on immigration in Farwell last week. Our nation needs to reform our immigration laws and put forth policies that protect our sovereign border, restore the rule of law and put the American people first.To do that, we must not only secure our border with physical and technological barriers, but also ensure we close loopholes in our immigration policies and enforce the rule of law. Only when we resolve these concerns, will we be in a position to solve the DACA issue. 
See here for information on the Securing America’s Future Act (SAFA), legislation I supported earlier this year to reform our immigration policies. Unfortunately, we were unable to get the votes to pass SAFA. Even though the bill wasn’t perfect, it would have given the President the tools and resources he needs to secure the border and stop illegal immigration. Additionally, SAFA would have provided a significant win for West Texas by authorizing a new agricultural guest worker program that our farmers desperately need, while cutting off the employment magnet for illegal immigrants by mandating use of E-Verify. I will continue to work with my colleagues to get this right and move legislation that will finally protect our sovereign border, restore the rule of law and put the American people first.
￼ 
Stronger Trade 
Thanks to those in Farwell who also came out to discuss trade and what’s going on in Washington. President Trump knows what’s on the line for our agriculture producers and job creators that do business with our northern and southern neighbors. As are our farmers and ranchers, I am looking forward to a strong NAFTA deal that encourages free and fair trade. 
￼ 
Pro-Growth Policies 
Our pro-growth policies have enabled a renewed sense of optimism in West Texas – I could see it in my visit with a few of The Home Depot’s hardworking employees. We are witnessing a great American comeback, and the good people of West Texas are better off because of it. See below for a video on our visit. ↓
￼ 
Rural Infrastructure 
Nearly half of rural Americans STILL lack access to broadband services. Investments in rural infrastructure like broadband technology are needed to finally close the digital divide between urban and rural communities. Fortunately, the House version of the 2018 Farm Bill does just that by securing development resources. Thank you, Lyntegar Electric Coop, for the invite to your annual meeting.
￼ 
Esteemed Cadet 
Congratulations to Civil Air Patrol Cadet Colonel Andrew Allison for being the distinguished recipient of the General Carl A. Spaatz Award – the highest cadet honor granted for excellence in leadership, character, fitness, and aerospace education. His years of diligence has surely paid off as he continues his education at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. I am proud to be from the same hometown, but prouder of his heart to serve. 
￼ 
Please know, it is an honor to be your Representative. Feel free to reach out to my office and let me know how I can best serve you.

8/22/18 18:28,Join Me For A Town Hall In Streamwood ,"￼ 
  

Dear Neighbors,
As the summer is winding down, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you all. It is an honor to serve you in Congress, and it is especially humbling when I come back to the district and meet with you in person. We have had some exciting events this past month, and I want to thank everyone who came out to share your thoughts, ask questions, and learn more.

I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to our upcoming town hall on Monday, August 27th from 6:00 PM - 7:15 PM. We will meet at the Poplar Creek Public Library at 1405 S. Park Avenue in Streamwood to hear questions or comments that you all have for me. Please RSVP here and if you have any questions, you can reach my office at 847-413-1959. (Note: Poplar Creek Public Library offers meeting room space to the community. It neither endorses nor sponsors this event, presenting individual, or organization.)

I was proud to host veterans of the Vietnam War and their families in Elk Grove Village last week to recognize them for their sacrifice and service to our country. I will continue to honor and fight for our service members and veterans in Congress, and want to encourage any veterans in our district to reach out to my office if you ever encounter any issues with receiving the benefits you earned. 

￼

Earlier in the month, I hosted a round table with WGN Meterologist Tom Skilling to discuss Climate Change, its effects, and what we can do to prevent further damage to the environment. (Photo below) Don Wuebbles from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and Doug Sisterson of Argonne National Laboratory were also there to share their expertise on this issue.
￼

We also held a town hall on school safety and gun violence prevention in Hoffman Estates.We were joined by Ravi Baichwal of ABC7, State Representative David Harris, local students from the 8th District, and Lauren Carr who is a survivor of the Northern Illinois University school shooting. We had a productive conversation on what can be done to combat the epidemic of gun violence in America. (Photo below)

￼

Thank you to everyone contacting my office to make your voice heard, and please continue to do so in person, over the phone, or through Facebook, Twitter, and my website.


Warm Regards,
￼

My Time Around the District
Dear Friends,

Traveling over 1,000 miles throughout the state last week, I thoroughly enjoyed getting to visit with community leaders, business owners, and many residents, just like you. Hearing your thoughts and concerns helps me immensely, and I promise to keep listening.

Last Wednesday morning, I joined ministers and spiritual leaders in Loganville for a legislative breakfast roundtable. Surrounded by more than 40 faith leaders, I was deeply encouraged as I learned about their work in the community and joined with them for a time of prayer. I can’t over express my gratitude to each member who met with me. I appreciate all of their efforts to support the community and look forward to meeting again.

Afterwards, I spoke with students at Loganville Christian Academy as they kicked off another school year. I enjoyed having the opportunity to meet with these impressive students while also answering their questions about government, Washington, D.C., and life as a Congressman. I’m thankful for the faculty of LCA for doing their part in shaping our Nation’s future through the education of today’s youth.

At lunch, I again was honored to receive the U.S. Chamber’s “Spirit of Enterprise Award,” which was presented to me at an event with the Gwinnett Chamber of Commerce. The “Spirit of Enterprise Award” is a great honor, and I’m proud to be able to work in the House to advance our national interests. When our economy does well, hardworking Americans are able to find good jobs, create new opportunities, and take care of their families and futures. I look forward to continuing to work each day for the best interests of the 10th District.

Next, I happily hosted another Coffee with Your Congressman event for 10th District residents in Dacula. With the smell of fresh brew filling the room at TradeWind Coffee Company, I provided a legislative update, took questions from the crowd, and discussed recent economic development opportunities occurring in the region. A big thanks to everyone who stopped by the event! Stay tuned for details about my next one.

Later in the afternoon, I met with Mr. Melvin Farr, a resident of Bethlehem who has proudly served in the U.S. Army and Georgia National Guard. A JROTC teacher at Jackson County Comprehensive High School, Mr. Farr provided great insight into school safety measures and ways to better increase the security of our schools.

I wrapped up Wednesday by hosting a recognition ceremony for Doster Harper, a 2018 Eastside High School and Newton College and Career Academy graduate, who recently received a Congressional ROTC Scholarship. Through his leadership on multiple fronts, Doster has proven himself to be an exceptional young man with a passion for making a difference in the community. Earlier this year, I was humbled to nominate him for the Army Congressional Scholarship Initiative, and as a result, Doster is proudly attending the University of Georgia as a freshman this fall.

The Army Congressional Scholarship Initiative is a four-year grant that helps with tuition, room and board, and books for students who desire to serve our country as uniformed officers. With this scholarship, Doster will be committed to serving at least four years in the U.S. Army.

Thursday was another full schedule of site visits and meetings. I started the day by learning about the important work of Circle of Love Center, Inc., a resource center for women who are facing domestic violence. Established in 2002, this 30-day facility has provided safe shelter and services to over 5,850 victims and their children. While there, I also met with board members and explored the center. The work happening here is truly remarkable, and I cannot thank each of you enough for showing me the facility.

Next, I took a trip to NIBCO in Greensboro for a tour of its plant. Operating for nearly 40 years, this facility is now the largest manufacturing employer in Greene County with 220 associates. I was happy to see its recent expansion of a new $8 million, 122,000 square foot warehouse distribution space and twenty truck bay doors firsthand. 

I’m also very proud that NIBCO was named the 2018 Mid-sized Manufacturer of the Year for the State of Georgia by Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG) and the Georgia Department of Economic Development. Keep up the great work!

Following lunch, I dropped by Boiler and Steam Performance Company, a corrugated business with complete steam system solutions to provide manufacturers of all sizes and types with the ideal results for their production needs, including boiler rooms, steam systems, control systems, vessels, and parts. The company also offers application engineering and system design, system audits and testing, installation, start-up, and training. What a remarkable small enterprise, thanks for showing me the site!

Then, I traveled over to Union Point for a tour of Penfield Addiction Ministries and met with its leadership team. Since 1979, Penfield Christian Homes, Inc. has carried out its mission to “Reclaim Alcohol and Drug Addicted Men And Women Through Christ and Christian Love.” As an organization, it successfully helps over 600 people each year find freedom from addiction and reclaim health, family, and productivity. During the visit, I was humbled to hear testimonials from three former clients of the recovery home who received help and treatment at the facility.

I finished the day in Athens with Dee Dee, where we attended a National Community Health Center educational event. Community Health Centers are locally-controlled, non-profit entities that provide primary care, dental care, behavioral health, and pharmacy services in our most underserved rural and urban areas. These health centers now provide more than 104 million coordinated and integrated patient visits every year in all 50 states and almost every Congressional district. A big thank you to Mayor Denson for reading the National Health Center Week proclamation, which commends our local centers for the great work that they do.

On Friday, I traveled south to Pooler, Georgia for a visit to JCB, Inc. and Daniel Defense. JCB is the fifth largest manufacturer of construction equipment in the world, and its 400,000 square foot factory in South Georgia produces major products, including the Army and Marine Corps High Mobility Engineer Excavator (HMEE), the Army and Marine Corps Light Capacity Rough Terrain Forklift, commercial skid steer loaders, and commercial backhoes.

Daniel Defense is a family-owned, privately-held firearms manufacturer located in Black Creek, Georgia. Founded in 2001 by President and CEO Marty Daniel, the company started from Marty’s vision to create custom rifle accessories for his personal use as an avid sportsman and supporter of the 2nd Amendment. With a combined 300,000 square feet of manufacturing facility, Daniel Defense has maintained a commitment to quality and continuous improvement. Thanks for having me!

Academy Day in Milledgeville  
It was a packed house at my 2018 Service Academy Day on Saturday! With representatives from four of the five U.S. Service Academies, students heard the best practices of the nomination and application processes. Every year, it is my honor to nominate some of the best and brightest in Georgia for appointments to our Nation’s service academies, and I hope this informational session benefitted future candidates. A big thank you to Georgia Military College for providing the venue for the event. Don’t forget, the application deadline for interested students is Wednesday, October 10, 2018 at 5:00 p.m.

""1,200 in 12"" Jobs Initiative
Last week, the leadership of the Robins Air Force Base Air Logistics Complex in Warner Robins, Georgia, announced that it will be launching a new hiring initiative to bring 1,200 new jobs to the area in the next 12 months. Just as I have been proud to work on behalf of Robins Air Force Base and its critical missions, I look forward to aiding this new initiative in every possible way to ensure the continued vitality of Robins and the community. I am working in Washington to make sure we provide our servicemembers and the U.S. military with the resources needed to protect our national security interests around the world. I applaud the 21st Century Partnership for its efforts on behalf of the base, and I am thankful to the leadership at Robins Air Force Base and the dedicated men and women serving in the workforce in Warner Robins who work every day to support our national defense. You can learn more about the available job opportunities online here.

Quick Correction
In last week’s newsletter, I referenced Elite Storage Solutions, LLC in Monroe as the Elite Storage Systems, which was founded by Dan South, the father of President and CEO Steve South. I truly appreciate all of their work in the community, and I thank those for catching my oversight. 

The Week Ahead
Earlier this week, I was in Macon for the annual Georgia Chamber of Commerce event, where we celebrated another great year of business in the state. Afterwards, I made a few stops at the Dollar General Distribution Center in Butts County and the American Woodmark Cooperation in Jackson. I look forward to speaking with students at UGA, touring sites in Athens, and visiting the Georgia National Guard in Marietta.

As always, I’m here to serve you. Please contact my office with any questions, comments, or concerns. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to keep track of upcoming legislation and events!

Sincerely,

Hice presents ROTC scholarship to Georgia freshman Walton Tribune – 8/15 For that, Rep. Jody Hice presented Harper with an Army ROTC scholarship on Wednesday afternoon. Part of the Army Congressional Scholarship Initiative, the four-year grant helps with tuition, room and board and books for students who aren’t accepted to West Point due to the limited number of seats but still make a positive impression. Hice said he was struck by Harper’s “persistence” during the past few years.

Support the Merit Systems Protection Board Reauthorization Act, H.R. 6391 FreedomWorks – 8/15 On behalf of FreedomWorks’ activist community, I urge you to contact your representative and ask him or her to support the Merit Systems Protection Board Reauthorization Act, H.R. 6391, introduced by Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.). This legislation would appropriate funds to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and make it easier to fire government employees for poor performance or misconduct while maintaining a fair review process.

8/22/18 17:06,Momentum for Chaco Protection Act,"￼
August 22, 2018
Dear Friend,
Chaco Canyon is both a world-class cultural resource, and a place of intense importance to New Mexico's Native communities. Today, I was proud to move the Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protect Act, a bill I introduced with Senator Tom Udall, forward in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
Our bill, which is supported by Navajo Nation, All Pueblo Council of Governors, New Mexico Wilderness Alliance, the Wilderness Society, and Southwest Native Cultures, would ensure the protection of Chaco ruins and the greater landscape surrounding the Chaco Culture National Historical Park by preventing any future leasing or development of minerals owned by the U.S. government that are located within a protected radius around Chaco.
The Greater Chaco landscape is incredibly complicated, with state, private, tribal, and individually allotted lands checker-boarded around invaluable cultural resources. For a number of years now, there has been an understanding between the Bureau of Land Management, the industry, local communities, tribes, and historic preservation advocates that no development would happen within 10 miles of the park boundary, in order to minimize impacts on the park, its viewshed, and related cultural resources.
Our legislation formalizes that agreement. It is an important piece of a complete solution to protecting the Greater Chaco Landscape. I continue to be grateful to all the New Mexicans raising their voices to protect Chaco's precious and sacred sites. Today's committee action was a positive step forward. 
Sincerely,
￼

Dear Friend, 

It's exciting to see a renewed optimism throughout Mississippi and across the nation, with small business operators expanding their operations, hiring new employees, and increasing employee benefits.  For the first time in years, there are more jobs available than people to fill them.  Recent figures show that there are 6.7 million job openings - 213,000 jobs added in June alone.  That's progress and I hope it will continue to lead to additional investments in our region as we roll back more harmful regulations and enhance pro-growth policies.

While we are making progress, national security continues to be a concern with unprecedented threats to our nation.  The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), signed into law by President Trump, will provide better support for our troops, but more work still needs to be done to restore funding levels which will better position our fighting forces to protect us at home and across the globe.  
                           
TO THE MOON, MARS, AND BEYOND

It was July 20, 1969, when Neil Armstrong took his first steps on the Moon.  This achievement was a great source of pride for Americans and a moment in time that will always be remembered.  Growing up, I remember well watching the launch of space shuttles, witnessing the power of human ingenuity.  NASA's Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, the largest engine test site in the nation, has always played a critical role in America's space exploration pursuits.

Last week, I had the opportunity to witness the long-duration test of the Aerojet Rocketdyne's RS-25 engine, which will be used to power NASA's new rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS).  The rocket will take astronauts to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.  I am excited about the future of space exploration with SLS and look forward to Mississippi and Stennis Space Center playing a large part in that effort.
                                            

NORTHROP GRUMMAN ANNIVERSARY

Happy 20th anniversary to Northrop Grumman in Iuka.  Northrop Grumman has a proven record of providing critical capabilities to our warfighters.  The company's Iuka workforce, which has grown to 150 employees, designs, builds and delivers space, defense, and aviation systems around the world.  We appreciate their commitment to our national defense and the Mississippi economy.  

￼

During the celebration, Scott Lehr, vice president of Northrop Grumman's Flight Systems Group (FSG), offered a closer look at the manufacturing processes for the company's Antares, Pegasus, and Minotaur launch vehicle large composite structures and the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V and Delta IV rockets.  Since 1998, the facility has increased in size to 320,000-square-feet, housing one of the largest autoclaves in the world, measuring 20 feet in diameter by 83 feet in length. 
                                            

WESTLAKE CHEMICAL

Mississippi's workforce is second to none which is why companies choose to locate here.  It is important that we maintain our workforce, making sure they have the educational opportunities to get the job done.  We are fortunate to have great partnerships in the district with community colleges that offer specialized training that some companies require.  Westlake Chemical, located in Aberdeen, is the maker of PVC resin and compounds used in commercial and residential applications.  Their products are used to make vinyl siding, wire and cable coating, and piping.  

￼

Last week, Westlake Chemical Plant Manager Jimmy Autrey introduced us to many of their team members who have benefited from the training offered in the district.  ""We need to make sure training options are available in the area to provide a workforce that is capable of maintaining our operations in a safe and efficient manner,"" said Autrey.


INTERNSHIPS

It is my pleasure to offer college students the opportunity to serve as an intern in our Washington, D.C. office or in the First District each semester and during the summer.  Interns have the opportunity to learn the legislative process and to assist our team as well as our constituents.

Dear Friend,
Recently, over 100 community partners and constituents gathered at my office in Tucson to celebrate our recognition for best constituent services in the U.S. House of Representatives. In early July, the Congressional Management Foundation awarded my office the first-ever Democracy Award to recognize the exemplary service we provide to our constituents by helping them navigate various federal agencies.
While much attention is paid to the policy discussion in Washington, D.C., our constituent services is the core of our congressional office. Our caseworkers are the unsung heroes who everyday come to work and never waiver in their dedication to the people of Arizona’s Third Congressional District. Thanks to their efforts, we’ve served over 15,000 individuals and families and helped them reunite with their family members, obtain important government benefits, and keep their homes. In FY 2017 alone, we saved our residents over $2 million in foreclosure postponements and modifications.
This award would not have been possible without my dedicated district staff and caseworkers who truly embody the definition of public service. We take great pride in being recipients of this honor and recommit ourselves to continuing to provide outstanding constituent services in our district. 
If you need help with a federal agency, please visit one of my district offices in Tucson, Somerton, and Avondale. In addition to these locations, we offer mobile office hours in San Luis and Nogales. Please check my website, or call my office for more information.   
Peace,

Mr. Goodman contacted our office regarding an update of his VA appeal. He was also seeking support for a bill to recognize service connection for veterans suffering from conditions related to their service at Ft. McClellan. Congressman Grijalva submitted a formal request for hearing to the Committee on Veteran Affairs.
￼
Mr. Deres came to our office for assistance regarding his son’s consular birth abroad certificate and his wife’s immigrant visa case. During our requests there was a requirement for DNA for his son’s case and his wife was affected by the travel ban during this process. The office was able to assist in both cases and Mr. Deres’ son and wife were able to reunite with him here in the US. 
￼
For several years, Mr. Abdul has been referring over constituents in need of assistance to our office. 
￼
Alexandra, one of our Constituent Services Representative read a letter on behalf of Mr. Lehot. Mr. Lehot's letter in part reads ""I am deeply and forever grateful for your assistance and for treating me with such compassion and respect during this most difficult of times.""
￼
Mr. Youtsey came to our office seeking assistance in correcting his ‘certificate of naturalization’, which was issued with the wrong date of birth. His request to correct the error had previously been rejected since he had no documentation of a U.S. court order or state-issued documents of a change of date of birth. My office worked with USCIS in Washington D.C. for close to 1 year until the correction was granted.

8/22/18 15:06,Standing up for NJ Law Enforcement,"
  
￼
Dear Neighbors,
Recently, I joined local law enforcement and leaders to stand against the Trump administration’s efforts to take away public safety grants from New Jersey. The administration is doing this because many New Jersey communities have chosen to resist some of the most extreme immigration policies of the Justice Department. New Jersey is being denied a total of $5,871,599.
￼
Local law enforcement is tasked with the difficult and often dangerous work of keeping our communities safe. They know the challenges they face and they know how best to address sensitive issues regarding immigration. I know that police in communities like New Brunswick and Asbury Park understand how to do their jobs and how to interact with immigrants without creating distrust. The last thing New Jersey law enforcement needs is an extreme and often incompetent Trump Justice Department telling them how to do their jobs.
Subscribe to my e-newsletter Follow me on Facebook Follow me on Twitter Follow me on Instagram
Our communities deserve the funding from COPS and JAG grants because our state helps to fund them. We should not be punished for having policies on immigration that are practical, humane, and in the best interests of our state. That’s why I joined a bipartisan letter urging the Justice Department to end its embargo of $174 million in approved Byrne JAG funds earmarked for police departments throughout the country, arguing that the administration’s posture “jeopardizes [police departments’ ability] to maintain law and order and do their job effectively.”
I will do everything within my power to ensure that our first responders get the money they deserve. 
Serving You  Lastly, one of my privileges as a Member of Congress is to assist my constituents on a range of issues, whether it be to help with a federal agency, ordering a flag, or requesting tours and tickets for a visit to Washington DC. Please take a moment to visit my website at pallone.house.gov or stop by my offices in Long Branch, New Brunswick or Washington, DC to find out how I can serve you.   Sincerely,  
Congressman Frank Pallone

Dear Friend, 
Highlighting the Amazing Work of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
Last week, I had a great visit to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) with Secretary of Energy Rick Perry. I had the opportunity to see how NREL continues to be a world leader in research and development. NREL's innovation comes from new technologies in both science and energy research. I will work to make sure the funding for these technological advancements continues so that our country and the rest of the world may benefit from the amazing results NREL produces.

Touring Swedish Medical Center
I recently toured Swedish Medical Center where I viewed demonstrations and saw some of the new developments the center is making in telemedicine. These improvements are being made to bridge the rural and urban divide in Colorado in order to increase access to quality care. While on my visit I was even able to take a look inside the emergency room in Yuma by video conferencing with doctors there. The work being done at Swedish is truly incredible.

Historic Bipartisan Parks Bills Hearing in Committee on Energy and Natural Resources
Last week, bipartisan parks legislation that I introduced received a hearing in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The two bills were the Pike National Historic Trail Study Act and the Amache Study Act. Zeublon Pike's trailblazer legacy deserves to be cemented in history by naming the route he took while traveling west, which is why it is included in the Pike National Historic Trail Study Act legislation. The Amache Study Act evaluates the importance of the former Japanese American relocation center in Granada. I've visited Camp Amache multiple times and every visit serves as a reminder of these dark events in our nations history. This act would properly honor these individuals and their ancestors.

Meeting with President Tsai   
I'm grateful to have had the chance to meet with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen in Los Angeles during her transit through the United States. My meeting with President Tsai focused on reaffirming America's support for the people of Taiwan. We discussed a variety of issues such as additional U.S support for Taiwan's international involvement and strengthening our defense ties. With China aggressively trying to delegitimize Taiwan, this meeting and our nations support for one another is more important than ever before.

8/22/18 14:39,Winning for Firefighters,"View this e-mail in your browser.

￼ 


  When firefighters run toward a burning building, they don’t ask if Democrats or Republicans are inside. They strive to protect all of us.  And when first responders need our help in Washington, I believe we must do the same. 
I fought for firefighters, and I won. My Firefighter Cancer Registry Act is now law. 
These days, there’s a lot of talk about how tough it is to get things done in Washington.  About how Democrats and Republicans just can’t seem to come together and make progress on the things the American people care about. It’s frustrating. Especially when there is so much work to be done. 
￼ 
That’s why I am exceptionally proud to let you know that Senators from both sides of the aisle – yes, every single one – united behind my bill to create a national firefighter cancer registry so researchers and doctors can study the possible links between the life-saving work they do and increased risks of the deadly disease.    
But, that’s not the end of the story. Because in Washington, it’s not enough just to pass my bill, I also needed Republicans to join me to provide the federal funding we need to get the national registry off the ground and running.  
And this week, we did it. The Senate voted – unanimously – to approve $1 million in start-up funding.   
I’ve always believed that when we focus on what unites us, when we put the politics of division aside, we can create positive change for the people we serve.  I’ve also always believed that when the fight is right, we must never – ever – give up.  When it comes to protecting our firefighters, I never will.

August 22, 2018 
Dear Friend,  
It continues to be a great honor to serve and represent you in the U.S. Senate. The following is a brief update on just some of the issues I’ve been working on.  
￼ 
Protecting Servicemembers and Their Families 
Recent reports indicate that the Trump administration is planning to undermine key aspects of the Military Lending Act and make it easier for unscrupulous lenders to target U.S. troops and rip off military families. I called for the administration to withdraw this immoral proposal immediately. They should be enforcing—not tearing down—protections for servicemembers and their families. I also joined Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and other members of the Senate in urging the administration to maintain protections for U.S. troops from predatory lending and financial fraud. These families are defending our country and we need to have their backs!  
Lifting Unfair Burdens on Our Fishermen 

Our state’s commercial fishing industry is operating on razor thin margins and to make matters worse, they’ve been forced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to bear the burden of substantial fees to regularly monitor their catch. As the lead Democrat on the subcommittee that approves funding for NOAA, I led a successful effort to cover the costs of these fees for our fisherman and that funding is now available. The commercial fishing industry plays a key role in New Hampshire’s economy, history and culture, so ensuring the industry's sustainability will always be important to me. As the appropriations process for next year moves forward, I’ll keep fighting to make sure our local fishermen have the support and resources they need and are not saddled with these costs in the future. 
Working Across the Aisle to Free Americans Detained in Turkey 
￼ 
Turkey is an important NATO ally but isn’t acting like one. I am particularly troubled by the continued unjust detention of American citizens and U.S. embassy staff. Turkey's actions have been both inhumane and unwarranted, and Turkish officials must end this now by releasing these detained Americans. I joined Morning Joe on MSNBC with Senator James Lankford (R-OK) to discuss our bipartisan call for Turkey to release detained Americans and help get our relationship back on track. We are committed to continuing these bipartisan efforts to hold Turkey accountable and bring these unlawfully detained individuals home. 
Combating the Opioid Epidemic at Home in New Hampshire 
Last week, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services submitted a plan to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) for opioid response funding that the New Hampshire delegation helped secure. This funding is a seven-fold increase for New Hampshire compared to last year and will help save lives. I’m very pleased the state is submitting a broad plan to put these resources to use. New Hampshire desperately needs to expand access to treatment as far too many Granite Staters are suffering with substance use disorders with limited means to get the care they need. This available funding is a significant down payment on improving treatment access in our state and was the product of bipartisan, good-faith negotiations in Congress. New data from the New York Times on overdose deaths during 2017 further underscores the importance of a robust federal response that can meet the challenge of the opioid epidemic. Every overdose is a tragedy and every community in New Hampshire has been impacted. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I’ll continue to work across the aisle for additional opioid response funding as one of my top priorities in the Senate.  
Visiting the Upper Valley  
￼ 
Last Friday I was in the Upper Valley. In the morning I visited West Central Behavioral Health in Claremont and was briefed on their services that respond to the devastating opioid epidemic. This crisis reaches every community across our state, which is why organizations like West Central Behavioral Health are so important to expanding access to treatment and substance use recovery programs. We need to continue to empower local organizations to support families and individuals who are struggling in every region of New Hampshire. 
￼ 
In the afternoon I had the opportunity to visit the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Lab in Hanover. The scientists at CRREL are undertaking impressive research that allows the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, and the Department of Defense to operate in harsh and cold environments. CRREL recently brought four new “cold labs” online – it was just as cold as a New Hampshire winter in there! 
Ensuring NH Gets Answers on PFAS

New Hampshire families deserve answers about emerging contaminants in their water supplies, which is why I fought for an additional $10 million to support the second year of the PFAS health impact study. I’m pleased the authorization of these funds was signed into law last week. Communities across our state have been exposed to PFAS chemicals and it is imperative that our residents have the information necessary to understand the potential health implications for their children and families. 
Repealing Unfair Policies that Hurt Granite Staters 
￼ 
The Department of Defense’s per diem policy unfairly impacts Portsmouth Naval Shipyard workers. I fought for its full repeal so that workers at Portsmouth and across the country are no longer burdened with high out-of-pocket costs when they work at other shipyards. I’m very glad to see this bill signed into law as part of the annual defense bill, and will keep working across the aisle to advance legislation that protects Granite Staters and addresses concerns facing our communities.

Just wanted to send you a quick note about some changes to hours-of-service regulations, an issue I’ve heard from a lot of South Dakota truckers about.  
After months of pushing from myself, South Dakota truckers, and many others, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) yesterday announced it will reconsider the Obama administration’s hours-of-service regulations, which have placed a significant and unnecessary strain on many small trucking operations. Learn more about the changes here. 
While their proposal isn’t a complete home run, it is a strong step forward. The rule isn’t finalized yet, however. There is a 30-day public comment period for you to be able to weigh in with the DOT. If you would like to participate, it can all be done online at this link: goo.gl/v6x9Wd  
If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to let my office know. Have a wonderful rest of your week.

Poll: Rural Internet Access

Hoosiers,

Access to high-speed internet continues to be a key component in the most essential parts of our lives - education, healthcare, work, and connecting with loved ones. However, unfortunately, rural communities in America are struggling to obtain reliable internet access; it is estimated that 30.7 percent of Americans in rural areas lack access to fixed terrestrial broadband, as compared to 2.1 percent of those in urban areas.

Question of the Week: Do you believe the federal government should take action to address rural communities' access to internet?

[_] Yes.
[_] No
[_] I don't know.
[_] Other.

Take the poll here.

8/22/18 14:00,Supporting Buy America Reforms & Our Made in Wisconsin Economy,"Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window   Click here to open a plain text version of this email


￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Here in Wisconsin, we have a long and proud tradition of making things. That’s what we do and we do it well. 
We possess one of the largest manufacturing sectors in the nation, supporting a large share of our workforce and exporting goods all over America and the world. Our work ethic is second to none and I believe that hard work should be respected and rewarded. 
That is why I have focused my efforts in the U.S. Senate on strengthening our Made in Wisconsin manufacturing economy. 
I strongly believe American workers should build our infrastructure with American products, and our taxpayers’ money should not be spent to support foreign workers. But the federal government currently spends billions of taxpayer dollars on infrastructure projects that are not subject to Buy America requirements. The result is American taxpayer money is being spent to buy foreign products and support workers in other countries. We need to change this and rewrite the rules so we are supporting American businesses and our workers here at home. 
So I went to Fives Giddings & Lewis in Fond du Lac to introduce my Made in America Act, new legislation to strengthen Buy America requirements for the federal government in order to support American businesses, manufacturers and workers. 
 “It’s time for Washington to wake up and start delivering solutions. Buy America is the right direction for Wisconsin’s economy and I commend Senator Baldwin for her leadership on this issue.” 
— Steve Thiry, President & CEO of Fives Giddings & Lewis 
￼ 
Recently, I also introduced the Made in America Shipbuilding Act to strengthen Buy American requirements for the federal government’s purchase of ships because I believe that every vessel in the U.S. Navy should be made in America.
If U.S. taxpayer dollars are used to purchase any type of vessel, my Made in America Shipbuilding Act requires that it is made in America by skilled American workers, uses domestically produced materials and includes critical shipboard components that are manufactured in the United States. 
Wisconsin manufacturers and workers, like the men and women who work at Neenah Foundry, also help build our nation’s water infrastructure and they deserve a solid commitment from Washington that rewards their hard work. My Made in America Water Infrastructure Act will ensure we are rebuilding America’s crumbling drinking water infrastructure with American-made iron and steel and American labor. 
This isn’t a partisan issue — Washington should agree with my approach, and when we rebuild our nation’s infrastructure we should use American products, including U.S. iron and steel. President Trump has often said that we need to “Buy American and Hire American” and last year in Kenosha, he even supported my Made in America Water Infrastructure Act saying, “I agree with her 100 percent.” 
I’m proud to have earned the President’s support for my Buy America reform and I worked to make sure it is included once again in bipartisan Senate water infrastructure legislation. I will continue to push for this long-term commitment to American workers because their hard work deserves a permanent Buy America standard. 
Now is the time to get the job done for workers in Wisconsin and across this country. 
Wisconsin workers and manufacturers need results, and I’m going to continue working to ensure that we are doing right by them by making sure that America is buying what Wisconsin makes.

U.S. Senator for Wisconsin

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
September 4th, 2018 Deadline to Register for FEMA Disaster Assistance.
If you were affected by the severe storms and flooding from June 19th to July 13th, 2018, I strongly encourage you to register for disaster assistance. 
Cameron, Hidalgo, and Jim Wells Counties have received federal disaster declarations and residents of these counties are now eligible for federal assistance. You can register with FEMA online, on the FEMA Mobile App, by calling FEMA at 800-621-3362, or by visiting a disaster recovery center. For a list of disaster recovery centers in South Texas, please click here.  
Resources on how to prepare and respond to this and future natural disasters can be found on my website here. 

2018 Farm Bill
Every five years, Congress needs to pass a Farm Bill, which sets agriculture and nutrition policy and provides essential funding for programs that support our nation's farmers and producers, while keeping high quality and affordable food on the table for all Americans. The House of Representatives and Senate passed their versions of the 2018 Farm Bill. Both bills will now head to conference in order to negotiate one final bill.   
I am honored to have been appointed to the Conference Committee to help craft the final version of the 2018 Farm Bill. As a conferee, I plan to bring attention to issues of importance to farming, ranching, and food communities in South Texas. 
My priorities include funding to fight the Cattle Fever Tick; maintaining the US Sugar Program in its current form to support hard-working sugar cane growers in South Texas; and ensuring that crop insurance, citrus disease research, and disaster response programs have necessary resources to aid those impacted by the ever-changing challenges facing American agriculture.  
As a negotiator, I will also work to strip provisions from the bill which would harm critical nutrition programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). These ill-advised proposals would block access to food for children, seniors, and the most vulnerable members of our communities and would result in an estimated two million Americans unable to get the help they need. 

I look forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle and across Capitol Hill to produce a Farm Bill that includes these priorities, in addition to other issues of importance to the agriculture industry.

Rep. Vela with the winners of the challenge.
Do The Write Thing Challenge
Recently, I met with three winners of the ‘Do the Write Thing Challenge’ from South Texas and the Costal Bend area. The contest gave middle school students the opportunity to write reflections of how youth violence has personally affected them. It was a privilege to meet these students and read their powerful first-hand accounts. 
In addition to the writing contest, students participated in a classroom discussion on preventing youth violence. I applaud their commitment to raising awareness and fighting to end violence in their communities. 
  
Brownsville South Padre Island Airport Improvements

The City of Brownsville was recently awarded $730,000 from the Federal Aviation Administration to help the Brownsville South Padre Island International Airport (BRO) make necessary improvements to its runway infrastructure. Additionally, BRO received $250,000 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Small Community Air Service Development Program. This grant will allow closer integration with the George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston and promote more national and global travel opportunities.  
Upgrading our airport infrastructure and expanding flight availability will help bring more visitors and increased economic activity throughout the region. I will continue to support federal funding to benefit our land, air, and sea ports in South Texas.

72,000.  
That’s the record number of  people who lost their lives last year from drug overdoses  — the leading cause of death among Americans under 50. 
We can’t let this epidemic continue. 
That’s why I just asked U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to immediately pass the Patients and Communities Act. This important bill, which has already passed the House, expands access to treatment and toughens screening to intercept deadly drugs such as fentanyl before they enter the country. 
Read this article below and please share with me if anyone you know has been affected by the drug crisis.

Bleak New Estimates in Drug Epidemic: A Record 72,000 Overdose Deaths in 2017 
Drug overdoses killed about 72,000 Americans last year, a record number that reflects a rise of around 10 percent, according to new preliminary estimates from the Centers for Disease Control. The death toll is higher than the peak yearly death totals from H.I.V., car crashes or gun deaths.   
Analysts pointed to two major reasons for the increase: A growing number of Americans are using opioids, and drugs are becoming more deadly. It is the second factor that most likely explains the bulk of the increased number of overdoses last year.  The picture is not equally bleak everywhere. In parts of New England, where a more dangerous drug supply arrived early, the number of overdoses has begun to fall. That was the case in Massachusetts, Vermont and Rhode Island; each state has had major public health campaigns and has increased addiction treatment. Preliminary 2018 numbers from Massachusetts suggest that the death rate there may be continuing to fall.  But nationwide, the crisis worsened in the first year of the Trump presidency, a continuation of a long-term trend. During 2017, the president declared the opioid crisis a national public health emergency, and states began tapping a $1 billion grant program to help fight the problem.  “Because it’s a drug epidemic as opposed to an infectious disease epidemic like Zika, the response is slower,” said Dan Ciccarone, a professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies heroin markets. “Because of the forces of stigma, the population is reluctant to seek care. I wouldn’t expect a rapid downturn; I would expect a slow, smooth downturn.”  A large government telephone survey suggests that around 2.1 million Americans had opioid use disorders in 2016, but that number may be an undercount because not all drug users have telephones and some may not mention their drug use because of the stigma. Dr. Ciccarone said the real number could be as high as four million.  The number of opioid users has been going up “in most places, but not at this exponential rate,” said Brandon Marshall, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health. “The dominant factor is the changing drug supply.”  Strong synthetic opioids like fentanyl and its analogues have become mixed into black-market supplies of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and the class of anti-anxiety medicines known as benzodiazepines. Unlike heroin, which is derived from poppy plants, fentanyl can be manufactured in a laboratory, and it is often easier to transport because it is more concentrated.  Unexpected combinations of those drugs can overwhelm even experienced drug users. In some places, the type of synthetic drugs mixed into heroin changes often, increasing the risk for users. While the opioid epidemic was originally concentrated in rural, white populations, the death toll is becoming more widespread. The penetration of fentanyl into more heroin markets may explain recent increases in overdose deaths among older, urban black Americans; those who used heroin before the recent changes to the drug supply might be unprepared for the strength of the new mixtures.  “Even when you think you’re doing better,  all it takes is one bad batch of fentanyl in any state and you’re going to have deaths,” said Mark Levine, a physician and the health commissioner of Vermont, which has made major investments in addiction treatment but still experienced a spike in deaths in 2016. Last year, deaths fell slightly there.  According to the C.D.C. estimates, overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids rose sharply, while deaths from heroin, prescription opioid pills and methadone fell.  In much of the West, overdose deaths have been flatter as the epidemic has raged in parts of the East and Midwest. That geographical pattern may be a result of the drug supply. Heroin sold west of the Mississippi tends to be processed into a form known as black tar that is difficult to mix with synthetic drugs. The heroin sold toward the east is a more processed white powder that is more easily combined with fentanyls.  Overdose deaths rose sharply in several mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states. In Ohio, Indiana and West Virginia, where the opioid death rate has been high for years, overdose deaths increased by more than 17 percent in each state. In New Jersey, they rose 27 percent.  The C.D.C. numbers for 2017 are an estimate, not a final count. The federal government collects death records from states throughout the year. But some deaths can take longer to investigate than others. The C.D.C. adjusts early numbers based on the number of deaths still under investigation by assuming a predictable proportion of them will turn out to be drug overdoses based on past experience. Using deaths that are confirmed, the agency measured a 10.2 percent increase in overdose deaths between 2016 and 2017. Using its adjusted data, the increase was 9.5 percent.

Beatty Brings Healthcare Leaders, Government Officials, and Nonprofits Together to Discuss the Future of Healthcare
COLUMBUS, OH–U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) recently hosted her Healthcare Roundtable and Listening Session for Ohio’s Third Congressional District. More than 30 healthcare executives, community leaders, government officials, nonprofits, and stakeholders participated in Beatty’s Roundtable and Listening Session, sharing their perspective on improving the access and delivery of healthcare and fresh ideas to make sure more individuals and families can live happier, healthier lives.
“Today is all about strengthening the dialogue between policymakers, stakeholders, and the healthcare community in Central Ohio,” Beatty said. “Americans are concerned about rising healthcare and prescriptions costs and quality of care, and your insight will allow me to work closely with my Congressional colleagues to develop positive, sustainable policy solutions to these and many more pressing healthcare issues facing our nation.” 
￼ Congresswoman Beatty discussed the current state of healthcare and what needs to be done so everyone has access to healthcare. 
During Beatty’s Healthcare Roundtable and Listening Session, attendees heard from a distinguished panel of experts, including Tracy Cloud, Lower Lights Health Chief Executive Officer; Dr. Curtis Gingrich, OhioHealth Vice President of Medical Affairs; Elizabeth Seely, OSU Wexner Medical Center Chief Administrative Officer; Michael Wilkins, Mount Carmel East President and Chief Operating Officer; and Dr. Mysheika Roberts, Columbus Public Health Health Commissioner. Panelists highlighted their organization’s work, as well as their personal insight on the Affordable Care Act, the need for more federal funding and greater collaboration between one another, and urged Beatty to fight in Congress to create a comprehensive healthcare system that addresses the physical, psychological, and emotional needs of patients. 
""The right to healthcare is different than the right to be healthy, ""  Sandy Stephenson, Director of Integrated Healthcare at Southeast, Incorporated, said at the roundtable.
""We have to take care of people from pre-birth to senior years ,"" Charles B. Tavares, President of Primary Health, remarked.
At the conclusion of the Healthcare Roundtable and Listening Session, Beatty pledged to continue working with panelists, attendees, and many others in the community, saying, “We can help set the standard for providing exceptional and quality care, and I look forward to working with each of you to make this shared goal a reality—not just in Central Ohio but across America.”

Dear Lindsey,
Today, I joined NPR's Joshua Johnson to discuss why we need to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment and finally enshrine women's rights in the Constitution.
 
I'll tell you what I told him; we need this amendment so that the laws that we've already passed to protect women's rights have the backing of our nation's highest legal document. We need this bedrock so that no one - not Congress, not the President, not state legislatures or local governments - can roll back our rights. I've spent far too much of my time in Congress fighting to hold on to what we've already won, rather than being able to focus on moving us forward even more. 
You can listen to the full show here. 
Together, we can pass the #ERAnow. We've been fighting for this amendment for decades now, carrying on the legacy of Alice Paul and the suffragettes and I believe that in this #MeToo and #TimesUp era, with more women than ever speaking out and raising their voices, we can and we will make lasting change. I'm proud to be in this fight with you. 
Sincerely,

8/21/18 19:03,An Update on Montana Wildfires," ￼
 
￼
More than a dozen wildfires are currently raging across
western Montana, having already burned nearly 45,000 acres.

The smoke has gotten so bad that this week, the Montana Department of Environmental Quality issued an air quality alert for all 56 counties in the state.  That’s why I’m doing everything I can to make sure our firefighters and first responders have the tools they need to fight these flames.   Last year’s wildfire season pushed the Montana National Guard’s firefighting equipment to its limit. So, I fought to secure two new firefighting bucket kits for CH-47 helicopters and five for UH-60 helicopters so the Montana National Guard has better tools to protect lives and property.  In 2017, firefighting costs also ate up 56 percent of the Forest Service’s budget. That’s because, up until this year, funding to fight wildfires didn’t come from emergency response accounts like other natural disasters, it came straight out of the U.S. Forest Service budget. That's why I got a long-term wildfire funding fix passed that provides enough resources to both fight and prevent wildfires.  As a result, the USDA announced a new plan last week to combat wildfires. This plan will give the Forest Service a new roadmap for working with state and local partners to treat hazardous fuels while freeing up resources it needs to actively manage forests, maintain roads and trails, and mitigate future fire risks.  To help bolster these efforts, I also wrote and passed legislation requiring FEMA to make an additional 15 percent of Fire Management Assistance Grants available for mitigation work. This will free up $3.4 million that Montana can use to help prevent future wildfires.  So as this year’s wildfire season grows more intense, I want you to know I’m working hard to keep Montana families, property, and businesses safe.  This is a scary time for folks across our state. So if you need any help, please don’t hesitate to reach out to my office for information, advice, or assistance.

It's Startup Week Across America!
 
Greetings, 
This week is National Startup Week. I’m proud to be a co-chair of this year's ""Startup Day Across America"" to raise awareness of entrepreneurial activity and job creation happening here in our district. Small businesses and startups are the lifeblood and backbone of our economy. They're also the driving force behind most of the new jobs created in the United States.
This Wednesday, August 22nd, 2018, I'm visiting Industrious Brooklyn, a prominent startup company in Prospect Heights, for a tour and round table.
Industrious is the nation's leading and largest premium co-working space provider. Their space houses diverse professionals from single entrepreneurs and start-ups, to non-profits, media and content creators, and Fortune 500 companies.
As a member of the House Committee on Small Business, I believe that small businesses and startups play a pivotal role in the strength and wellness of our local economy and our community as a whole.
Please answer the survey question below to share your small business/startup with our office.
 
Yours in Service,
￼
Yvette D. Clarke

8/21/18 17:36,Shortsighted,"￼
August 21, 2018
Dear Friend,
Today the Trump administration announced a new rule to gut the Clean Power Plan--taking us in the completely wrong direction.
When we know exactly what we need to do to reduce our contributions to climate change--and when we have the capability to create thousands of new jobs and build a thriving clean energy economy--President Trump's decision to retreat from leadership is shortsighted, willfully ignorant, and immoral. 
The Clean Power Plan was a historic step in combating climate change and protecting the health of our kids and future generations. It established reasonable and achievable standards to reduce our carbon emissions and create thousands of new clean energy jobs in the process. But now the Trump administration wants to reverse course.
￼
VIDEO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich joins leading climate and public health advocates at the U.S. Capitol to outline the damage of the Trump administration's plan to gut the Clean Power Plan, August 21, 2018.
There is no doubt that climate change is already disrupting our lives. We are seeing unprecedented wildfires raging throughout the West, more extreme weather events across the nation, and volatile precipitation patterns in New Mexico that are causing both dangerous drought conditions and violent flash floods. 
If we fail to reduce carbon emissions, the consequences of our inaction will only become greater, and our solutions will only become more expensive. I will do everything I can to oppose this proposal because we can no longer wait to act on climate. 
Sincerely,
￼
MARTIN HEINRICH United States Senator

From the Hill to the Mountains
Advocating for the ARC Headquarters Relocation to West Virginia
I recently wrote a letter urging members of the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations to include language in the FY19 minibus appropriations bill that ensures the relocation of the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) headquarters to West Virginia.
In 2017, the Commission supported 591 projects totaling $152.3 million, with 73% of these investments going toward the most distressed areas within the region.  These community development efforts are critical to our economic vitality and progress, and I am pleased that both the Senate and House bills provide level funding at $155 million for ARC. I hope the final version of the appropriations bill contains this funding level as well as the Senate’s language regarding the relocation of the ARC to West Virginia, which received a vote in Committee and passed with bipartisan support.
Click here to read the full letter. 
  
  
  
How May We Help You?
I truly appreciate the opportunity to hear from my fellow West Virginians. As your U.S. Senator, I am proud to be your voice with government agencies during your time of need. My goal is to provide top-notch customer service for every West Virginian who contacts me, or who may need help.  I have a team of caseworkers in each of my four offices to help you with matters of concern. While I have no direct jurisdiction in the administrative matters of any federal, state, or local agency, I welcome the opportunity to assist you with whatever problem you may be experiencing and ask that full consideration be given to your case.
Recently, Angie Walsh, a caseworker in my Martinsburg Office was able to assist Ms. Susan Turner, of Charleston, with her VA claim for aid and attendance benefits for an elderly family member.  Angie worked with VA officials to ensure that the case was thoroughly and expeditiously reviewed so that Ms. Turner’s family member could receive the care and assistance that she needed. Caring for our aging loved ones can feel overwhelming.  My casework staff is available to assist you with obtaining information about services available in your community and throughout our state. 
 
On the Road
This week I got the chance to talk with religious leaders, business owners, individuals of the medical community and West Virginians with pre-existing conditions in the Eastern Panhandle. I’m hearing from people all across West Virginia that they are concerned that this lawsuit to repeal their healthcare, being waged by West Virginia’s Attorney General, will go through and they will be dropped from their health insurance, or unable to afford the payments. With nearly 800,000 West Virginians with pre-existing conditions, this impacts every family in West Virginia. For West Virginians with cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, and many other illnesses and conditions, this could be the difference between life and death. I’m doing everything I can to prevent that from happening. 
￼ 
Senator Manchin meets with members of the community including religious leaders, medical professionals and business owners regarding pre-existing conditions.

I spent Saturday afternoon in Huntington celebrating the annual Italian Festival. At a young age, Italian festivals allowed me to understand the importance of family history and to recognize and appreciate the value of our lineage. It's always a privilege to celebrate that heritage with my fellow West Virginians at all the festivals and fairs across our state. I was honored to recognize the Torlone family as 2018 Business Family of the Year, Dr. Pete Chirico as the 2018 Italian American Community Leader of the Year, the D'Antoni family as the 2018 Italian Family of the Year, and Emery and Van Vass as our 2018 Hunger Heroes for their voluntary service at the Facing Hunger Food Bank.

Congressman Cook Condemns El Salvador's Break with Taiwan
Congressman Paul Cook, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, issued the following statement on El Salvador’s break of diplomatic relations with Taiwan and establishment of relations with China:

Chairman Cook: “El Salvador’s decision to break relations with Taiwan in favor of China is deeply disturbing, and it further upsets the longstanding balance in the region following Panama and the Dominican Republic’s recent decision to establish ties with China. I have made clear my concerns with China’s growing influence in the Western Hemisphere, and this decision by the Salvadoran government undermines our shared goals for greater regional development. It's also the latest in a trend of worrisome decisions by the Salvadoran government in continuing their support for the murderous dictatorships in Venezuela and Nicaragua and insufficient efforts to address corruption and money laundering. The U.S. provides millions of dollars in foreign assistance to support El Salvador and Central American countries’ goals to achieve security and economic prosperity. These types of decisions put U.S. assistance at risk and threaten our important cooperation on many key issues.”

NOTE: Chairman Cook published an op-ed in the National Interest on June 3, 2018 expressing concern about China’s influence in Latin American and the Caribbean

Rockin' the Desert Mud Run
￼
Did you know that by participating in the Rockin’ The Desert Mud Run, you are contributing to an amazing non-profit program? The Apple Valley Police Activities League (A.V.P.A.L.) was founded in 2003, and was created to unite law enforcement and communities by providing youth programs which develop discipline, positive self-image, mutual trust and respect. Each year, A.V.P.A.L. works with about 200 kids! That’s 200 lives that are being led in the right direction, given a leg-up in the world. What a difference that makes in one community!

A.V.P.A.L. offers several different programs to youth in the Town of Apple Valley. After school programs are held at the Youth Center and Boxing Gym. A.V.P.A.L. also manages the intervention program known as S.H.O.C.K. for kids at risk. These programs were developed after seeing a need for children of the community to learn proper skills to be successful and productive members of society. 

A.V.P.A.L. is funded by support from the community, grants, through a partnership with the Town of Apple Valley and the Apple Valley Police Department, and by hosting awesome events such as the Rockin’ The Desert Mud Run. This year marks the fourth year A.V.P.A.L. has hosted this event and they are so excited to be able to continue this tradition. With this, comes the challenge of running this event with the mindset of conservation. We understand the responsibility we all have as a community to manage our water use, and fully appreciate the importance of conservation. With that being said, while keeping the FUN in the RUN, they will have fewer mud pits. Don’t think for a minute that means it will be less challenging! They will still have mud pits, obstacles, and of course, an ice bath.

Please remember, the kids of our community will reap the benefits of your participation in this event. They look forward to seeing you all there on August 25th! Just a reminder, T-shirts and medals are only guaranteed to the first 1,000 registrants/finishers.

I have been hearing a lot of talk recently about the effects that tax reform has had on South Carolina and our nation as a whole. It’s been seven months since this historic legislation became law. Here is some updated economic data I felt was important to share with you: 
	•	90% of Americans have seen a tax cut
	•	$2,059 - Average tax cut for a typical family of four
	•	Average individual in SC has seen $1,070 in tax cuts 
	•	3.4% Increase in real disposable income in the first quarter of 2018
	•	3.8% Unemployment rate, which is the lowest in nearly 20 years 
	◦	Unemployment rate for veterans is the lowest it’s been in almost 20 years
	◦	Unemployment rate for Americans without a high school diploma is at an all-time low
	•	1.3 million jobs created since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act became law
	◦	5.75 million new hires in May 2018, the highest level in 17 years and the second highest on record
	◦	Almost 40,000 new manufacturing jobs were created in July 2018 alone
	•	62.9% Increased labor force participation rate
	•	Small Business confidence level is at a record high
	•	Over 4 million Americans have been given bonuses or an increase in their benefits including pay raises, bonuses, 401k contributions, parental leave improvements, continuing education, economic investments in workers, and much more
	•	102 utility companies have lowered prices in 48 states, including SC, as a result of tax reform
	•	House passed the 2018 Farm Bill which strengthened work requirements for adults between ages 18 and 59 receiving SNAP assistance (food stamps)
	•	The number of Americans receiving SNAP benefits has continued to decrease because of job creation 
	◦	Almost 3.5 million since President Trump took office in January 2017
I am extremely pleased by the step we’ve taken in lowering the tax burden for middle class families and job creators. These tax cuts are working for the American people – plain and simple. I am in full support of making these tax cuts permanent so that we can continue to jumpstart our economy and keep up the great momentum.

Dear Lindsey, 
I enjoyed participating in Ivanka Trump’s visit of Pittsburgh’s Robotics Row! Ivanka brilliantly showcased Western Pennsylvania’s fast-growing technology industry and reinforced the importance of workforce development and STEM education. Her inspiring engagement with leaders from robotics companies, the Pittsburgh Technology Council and the members of the Girls of Steel robotics program is also a reminder that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act coupled with right-sized regulations are strengthening this important sector and creating opportunities to get fellow Western Pennsylvanians back in the game. 
￼  The Girls of Steel are a great example of women pioneering in the robotics field. 
Visiting Local Military Installations 
￼  Colonel Mark Goodwill, Colonel Ray Hyland, and Captain Matt Saccone updated me on the status of improvements at the 171st Air Refueling Wing. 
I had a great visit to Pittsburgh’s 911th Airlift and 171st Air Refueling Wings recently to receive updates on the upgrading of their respective facilities. Monitoring construction and maintaining regular communication with base leaders permits effective oversight of our taxpayer dollars. At project completion, the 911th will house C-17 planes as it embarks upon a new mission. I was able to update personnel on passage of the FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which funds our military, gives our troops a well-deserved pay raise, and equips them with the resources to fulfill their duties.
Honoring our Military and Veterans 
￼
Thank you to everyone who attended our Military and Veterans Appreciation Nights in Johnstown and Ross Township. Many of our Western Pennsylvania veterans shared their stories of heroic service. I provided updates on Congress’ efforts to support them. One such effort is my House-passed Free Veterans from Fees Act to ensure our veterans do not pay fees to visit their war memorials; the other is the House-passed Blue Water Vietnam Veterans Act to expand eligibility benefits for veterans exposed to Agent Orange. 
 Strengthening our National Defense 
￼  University of Pittsburgh’s use of cutting-edge technologies helps maintain our military. 
Recently, I supported the bipartisan FY 2019 NDAA to equip our troops with necessary funding, resources, and training. Research and technology at educational institutions such as the University of Pittsburgh help maintain the world’s finest military. Specifically, the Pitt Additive Manufacturing Research and the Neuromuscular Research Laboratories provide invaluable research and technology to enhance our military readiness. Thank you to the Pitt staff for their innovative work to strengthen our national defense. Go Panthers! 
Meeting with Beaver County Leaders to Combat the Opioid Epidemic 
￼  Joining Beaver County officials to address the Opioid Crisis 
Too many of our family members, neighbors, and communities have been devastated by the opioid crisis. Thank you to all of those who participated in the Beaver County Drug and Alcohol Coalition meeting to discuss ongoing local and federal efforts to combat this epidemic. To assist in these efforts, the House passed the bipartisan CRISIS Act, which includes several of my provisions to expand access to treatment and resources.
Strengthening our Workforce in Cybersecurity 
￼  Geneva College is preparing future leaders in cybersecurity. 
Cybersecurity helps provide for a safe nation, reliable electoral systems, and integrity-based financial networks. It was a pleasure to discuss the important cybersecurity curriculum Geneva College provides its student body. Through this program, students are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to help contribute to the effort to protect Americans from cyber threats and attacks.
Visiting a Johnstown Treasure 
￼  Coney Island Lunch makes its return to Johnstown. 
A Johnstown landmark, Coney Island Lunch, had been feeding the Johnstown community their famous hot dogs and sundowners for decades. After closing its doors a year ago, this storied eatery is back in business. Welcome back and thank you to owners Randy and Taylor Clark for the tour!
Thank you all for taking time to keep up with the work I am doing on your behalf! 
Sincerely,  ￼                                                Keith

8/21/18 13:27,Updated Disaster Recovery Center Addess: A Disaster Declaration for Lake County ,"￼ 
AUGUST 21, 2018
￼

￼

￼  ￼  ￼ 
Dear Friend, 

As you may have seen, on Friday the President issued a major disaster declaration for Lake County for the Mendocino Complex Fires, allowing federal funds to be available to help our community recover from these terrible fires. These resources are a critical step in our journey to rebuild and I am proud to have joined so many in our delegation to fight for this important declaration. 

Starting August 21st there will be a Disaster Recovery Center open daily from 9 am to 7 pm at 9470 Main Street in Upper Lake (please note updated address) where you can talk to experts about your options and resources available to you to help recover. I have also put together a disaster guide to help you and your family navigate the recovery process. You can click here to download and read that guide. Individuals who may be eligible for individual assistance should apply through one of the following options. 
	•	Apply by phone to FEMA: 1-800-621-FEMA (3362).  Disaster assistance applicants, who have a speech disability or hearing loss and use TTY, should call 1-800-462-7585 directly; for those who use 711 or Video Relay Service (VRS), call 1-800-621-3362. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time seven days a week until further notice.
	•	You can also apply online anytime at www.DisasterAssistance.gov.
	•	By smartphone or tablet, use www.fema.gov.
Please know you can always contact my office if you have questions about fire recovery, the disaster declaration, or any other issues. Together, we will recover and come back even stronger. 
Sincerely,
￼

It's August, which means folks in Wyoming have a great opportunity to get outdoors and do the summer activities we will miss in the winter. Work will continue here in the Capitol, so you may need to catch some fish for me at home. The Senate is still continuing work on measures to fund the government and on confirming nominees to federal judgeships and other important positions. I was also very pleased to see the career and technical education legislation I have worked on for more than a decade be signed into law by the president. I look forward to continuing to work hard for the people of Wyoming and I hope you have a good end to your summer.
￼

What's new?
President signs Enzi career and technical education bill into law
￼
President Trump signed a reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act into law, which will help students and workers get the skills they need to find high-skill, high-wage or in-demand jobs.
 
U.S. Senator Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., who worked to get the legislation passed with Senators Bob Casey, D-Pa., Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., praised its final passage. 
 
""I am proud of this bill and the bipartisan, and almost unanimous, support it has received. That does not happen without a tremendous amount of work to get it to that point.""

Enzi meets with U.S. Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh
￼ Enzi showing U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a colorized photo of the original Wolf Hotel in Saratoga. 
Enzi met with U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and issued the following statement:
 
“It was great to talk with Judge Kavanaugh about his years of experience and dedication to the judicial system. He is an extremely well qualified nominee whose prior rulings and writings demonstrate his commitment to the Constitution and the rule of law. I appreciated his thoughtful answers to my questions and look forward to the Senate’s consideration of his nomination this fall.”
 

Enzi cosponsors bill to hold senior IRS officials accountable
￼
In an effort to give the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) commissioner clear authority to fire senior officials for misconduct or poor performance,  Enzi cosponsored the IRS Accountability Act of 2018, which was introduced by U.S. Senator Richard Burr, R-N.C. 
 
“It is important that we can hold employees of the IRS accountable for their actions no matter how high up the chain of command they are,"" Enzi said. ""Misconduct is misconduct, and having the status of senior executive should not allow anyone to escape responsibility."" Learn more here. 
 
Enzi also wrote an op-ed article with Burr about the legislation to bring more accountability to the IRS. Click here to read the op-ed. 
 

Enzi applauds Wyoming leaders for opposing the Bank of the West's anti-fossil fuel policies
￼
Enzi issued the following statement after the Bank of the West adopted a policy that it will no longer do business with companies that engage in the exploration of production of coal, oil and natural gas:
 
""It’s very disappointing that the Bank of the West, which has 23 locations in Wyoming, has adopted this policy. I appreciate U.S. Senator John Barrasso, as chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, publicly denouncing the Bank of the West’s anti-fossil fuel policies that directly attack our state’s proud history of producing coal, oil and gas, which powers the nation and fuels our state’s economy.
 
“I support the strong leadership of our state officials, including Governor Matt Mead, who threatened to end the bank’s public depository status, which would bar state agencies from using Bank of the West for petty cash accounts and State Treasurer Mark Gordon, who announced that the state will no longer do business with the Bank of the West. I’m told some Wyoming county commissioners are also considering ending business with the bank. Wyoming has been blessed with a host of natural resources and it is important that federal, state, and local officials show support for industries that support communities across the cowboy state.”
 

Around the state
Cheyenne Frontier Days has for years been one of the greatest celebrations you can find in Wyoming – fully deserving of its title as “the daddy of ‘em all.” It represents the spirit and tradition of what it means to be from the West and Enzi said he was glad he was able to participate. See more
 
￼
 

 
Enzi said it was wonderful to attend the 125th anniversary of the Historic Wolf Hotel and Restaurant in Saratoga and it's nice to see history being kept alive. See more
 
￼
 

July 28 was National Day of the American Cowboy. Started in 2005 by Wyoming's own U.S. Senator Craig Thomas, it traditionally coincides with Cheyenne Frontier Days. Enzi was proud to have been a sponsor of this Senate resolution. See more

Come and Read It Report
Dear Texans, 
Last week, I had the opportunity to meet with constituents and businesses in the 25th District, and I'm looking forward to bringing their ideas and concerns back to Washington. It is my privilege to represent these communities, and I will continue fighting to keep your taxes permanent, your businesses thriving, and your families safe. As I travel throughout Central Texas, I wanted to let you know what I've been up to: 
￼ 
As the representative of a veteran-proud community, it was my honor to be with my fellow Americans last week in Hillsboro. Although the Vietnam War was a period in our nation's history that was marked by sharp divide, there is no mistake that it forever transformed the United States. These patriots selflessly defended this great nation, and for that I am forever grateful. It's past time that we welcome them home. For more information, click here.   
￼  
I had a great time talking with the members of the local Cleburne Lions Club about legislation that matter to them and what they'd like to see in Congress moving forward. We share the same priorities such as making tax cuts permanent for all Americans, and continuing to slash taxes for small businesses. For more information, click here.  
￼  
As long as I have been in Congress, it has been a priority of mine to fight for veterans' rights. I pledged to stand up for the men and women who wore our uniform because they stood up for us every minute of every day. I was humbled to be with our nation's heroes last week in Alvarado, and I thank them for their service in the Vietnam War. I am proud to represent these patriots in Washington, and I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure we look after our veterans. For more information, click here.   
￼ 
It was great to meet with local leaders at the Stephenville Economic Development Authority meeting last week to discuss the historic tax cuts that affect them every day. We talked about how they've been directly impacted, and what Congress can improve upon in Tax Reform 2.0. I look forward to fighting for them once I return to Washington to ensure taxes are fairer, flatter, simpler, and permanent. For more information, click here.  
￼ 
For years, the Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant has been supplying power to Americans. Today, they help power one of the world's largest electric markets, and we are lucky to have them right in the 25th District of Texas. The wellbeing of our community is a top priority, and I appreciate the Resident Inspection Team for the thorough update on how we can best perform safe operations at all times. I also had the chance to meet with the Texans who work at CPNPP and enjoyed answering their questions about what I'm working on in Congress. For more information, click here.  
￼ 
Last week, I stopped by the local Tanglewood Pharmacy and Medical Supplies in Stephenville, and had the chance to talk with some constituents about what Congress can do to better address healthcare and the opioid crisis. It was enlightening to hear their past experiences, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to address the epidemic.   
￼ 
Local businesses are the backbone of our economy, and as a small business owner for my entire life, it was great to meet with the folks in Hico to discuss what issues matter to them. I had the opportunity to hear firsthand from employers and workers about how tax cuts have helped them flourish in this community, and what improvements they want to see in the second phase of tax reform. Hardworking Americans deserve someone who understands the adversities that come with operating a business to represent them, and I am honored to be that person.  
I have included some articles and releases you may find interesting located on the right side of this newsletter. It is an honor and privilege to represent the people of Texas’ 25th Congressional District and as always, please reach out to me with any issues and concerns that are important to you. 
In God we trust, 
￼ 
Roger Williams 
Member of Congress

Space Force not a laughingstock, says U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper  The Tennessean Cooper is the top Democrat on the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. “Space is already a war-fighting domain,” he said. “Pretending our satellites are safe right now is foolish.”
New Russian Hacking Targeted Republican Groups, Microsoft Says  The New York Times Microsoft was surprised not that recent “spear phishing” attempts had occurred, but that they targeted traditional conservative think tanks. Those groups have been critical of Russia.

U.S. Moves Toward New Tariffs on China Despite Trade Talks  The Wall Street Journal The Trump administration is moving closer this week to levying tariffs on nearly half of Chinese imports despite broad opposition from U.S. business and the start of a fresh round of bilateral talks. 
$43,000 booth, 1 call to White House  The Washington Post The $43,000 phone booth that then-EPA administrator Scott Pruitt installed in his office may not have been worth all the headaches it caused him. He placed only one phone call to the White House, newly released records from the agency show. It lasted five minutes. 
EPA Head Signs Proposal to Undo Restrictions on Coal Plants  The Wall Street Journal The EPA moved to overturn Obama-era environmental rules on power-plant emissions, a long-telegraphed move designed to help coal-burning plants compete with cleaner alternatives.

8/21/18 10:23,APPLY NOW: U.S. Service Academy Nominations,"News from Representative Tom Emmer
￼
  
￼ 
Dear Friend, 
Each year I have the distinct honor of assisting individuals wishing to attend one of our nation’s service academies through the nomination process. I have an enormous amount of respect for those who wish to serve their country.
Jacquie and I are incredibly proud of our son Joey who is currently serving in the U.S. Navy. We are in admiration of his dedication to his country. The families of those who serve are also making sacrifices to support their loved one. Whether it’s a spouse, a child, a sibling, or a parent – these Americans play a vital role in the lives of our troops.
I am proud to see the work Congress has done to support military members, and their families. We have kept the brave men and women who selflessly serve our country our main-focus, and have recommitted our efforts to ensuring veterans receive the care they deserve.  
This week, President Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018. This year’s NDAA is the earliest completed in 41 years.  
The National Defense Authorization Act of 2018 will:  
	•	Provide a 2.4% pay raise to our troops.
	•	Reinvest in the tools and equipment needed to properly and safely train our military.
	•	Improve our missile defense capabilities, upgrade combat vehicles, and ensure our military has the resources it needs to be effective.
Congress is giving a long overdue “thank you” to our nation’s heroes. Their service protects our families, and they deserve our support.  
Service Academy Information Night

Visiting WaterOne in Johnson County
 
￼
Earlier this month, I visited Johnson County’s primary water treatment facility operated by WaterOne. Both Garney Construction and Black & Veatch are working on upgrading this important facility, which will provide clean drinking water to Johnson County. During the visit, I toured the site and met employees working on the project.
Garney Construction is an employee-owned business, which has had a major impact on the Kansas City area through the years. There is truly something special about employee-owned businesses, and I enjoyed meeting with these employees to hear more about what they do day-to-day. These types of businesses help workers feel more motivated and passionate about their companies, giving them a stake in their success, and increasing their retirement savings. I saw all of this on display during my visit with Garney Construction.
Touring the new tower at KU Cancer Center 
 
￼
After visiting with Garney Construction employees, I headed to the KU Cancer Center in Kansas City, where I checked out the new Cambridge Tower A. This facility is a fantastic addition for the people of Kansas.
Cambridge Tower A opened late last year and adds hospital beds and operating rooms to the hospital. 
During my tour, I visited with Dr. Roy Jensen, KU Cancer Center Director, Dr. Robert Simari, Executive Vice Chancellor at the KU Medical Center, and Dr. Richard Barohn, who serves as the Director of Clinical and Translation Science Institute at the KU Medical Center. They are all working hard to improve health outcomes for Kansans.
 
Doonan Specialized Trailers
 
￼
I also traveled to Great Bend, where I toured Doonan Specialized Trailers. During the tour, Mike Gordy, co-manager of Doonan Specialized Trailers, told me that it now costs an additional $800 to build a trailer due to steel and aluminum tariffs. I am concerned about how the tariffs and retaliatory tariffs are harming manufacturers, their employees and customers, as well as farmers and ranchers.
Mike also told me that the economy is strong and Doonan is hiring. He is in search of qualified welders and works closely with Barton County Community College on recruiting efforts.  
Dodge City Chamber 
 
￼
During the trip, I traveled to Dodge City, where I spoke at the Dodge City Chamber of Commerce coffee at the Historic Santa Fe Depot. It was nice to see many familiar faces. There were several questions about trade, agriculture and the Farm Bill.
 
Garden City Chamber
 
￼
I also traveled to Garden City, where I spoke with the Garden City Chamber of Commerce. Garden City is a growing community, for sure. During this stop, I provided the group with an update on what work I’ve been doing in Washington, D.C.
Trade, agriculture, tariffs and the Farm Bill were definitely the hot topics of discussion in Finney County as well.
 
A Productive August for the U.S. Senate
Usually in August the Senate is in recess allowing senators to work in their states. This August, the Senate is in session working to approve judicial nominations and confirm presidential appointees to the Executive branch. Despite the Minority’s stalling tactics, the Republican-led Senate has confirmed a total of 51 judicial nominees this Congress, including 24 circuit judges, 26 district judges, and Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch -- including two well-qualified judges for Kansas courts, Judge John Broomes and Judge Holly Teeter. The confirmation process is underway for President Trump’s second Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing is set to begin on September 4. 
Also this August, the Republican-led Senate is restoring regular order and working in a bi-partisan manner to do what we were elected to do: make the tough decisions on spending for the federal government.
Working in a bipartisan manner, the Senate has approved seven spending bills and is considering two more this month, including one of the most significant – our national defense. The Defense Appropriations bill contains a 2.6 percent pay raise for U.S. servicemembers, the largest pay raise for troops in almost a decade.
The Labor/Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill being considered this month contains billions of dollars to fight back against the opioid crisis; hundreds of millions to support and retrain American workers who need a boost back into the labor force; hundreds of millions more for employment training specifically for veterans; funding for the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health; and federal funding for our nation’s schools.
In addition, I am hard at work negotiating a Farm Bill as the Chairman of the Farm Bill Conference Committee. We hope to have our first public Conference Committee meeting when the House returns to Washington in September.

￼
Friends, 
Great news for our military!  I am pleased that last week President Trump signed the FY19 National Defense Authorization Act into law. This important measure continues to rebuild our nation's military and provides proper support to those who wear the uniform. You can watch a video of the bill signing ceremony here.  
RECAP FROM THE ROAD 
Last week I had a very productive and informative week traveling throughout AL-02. I really appreciate everyone who took the time to talk with me and share ideas and concerns. 
VISITING WAYNE FARMS 
￼
In Ozark, I stopped by Wayne Farms for a tour of their recently-opened feed mill. Wayne Farms is the sixth largest poultry producer in the U.S., with over $1.9 billion in annual sales. I’m grateful for the business they bring to our community!
WIREGRASS ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE UPDATE ON RURAL BROADBAND 
￼ 
I met with Wiregrass Electric Cooperative last week to receive an update on their rural broadband project. Troy Cable was there to tell me about some of the issues they’ve recently been facing in their work. Thank you for meeting with me!
VISITING GENEVA'S NEW CTE CENTER 
￼ 
I also visited Geneva Career Tech, also known as G-Tech, for a tour of the recently-completed CTE center. I was very impressed by the facility and the outstanding opportunities that are now available to students in the area. Career tech education programs are so important because they equip our students with the skills necessary to meet the demands of our steadily changing workforce. I will always support measures to improve the CTE programs throughout our state and nation. 
As I told WTVY, Congress passed and the President recently signed legislation reauthorizing the Perkins funding, which is critical to the CTE programs across our country. The State of Alabama is slated to receive $20,188,010 in CTE funding for this year. This is great news, and I will continue to support measures that strengthen CTE programs throughout our district and state. You can hear more in my interview here.  
MEETING WITH THE GIFT OF LIFE FOUNDATION 
￼ 
I visited the Gift of Life Foundation’s office in Montgomery to meet with leadership and tour their facility. The Gift of Life’s work to strengthen and improve our local community is truly invaluable. I deeply appreciate the hardworking people, like those at Gift of Life, who strive to make a difference in the lives of others.
MILLBROOK-COOSADA KIWANIS CLUB WEEKLY MEETING 
￼ 
I had the opportunity to speak to the Millbrook-Coosada Kiwanis Club during their weekly meeting. I was glad to give an update on the work we’re doing in Congress to make life better for the American people, and I was able to hear firsthand from my constituents about this issues impacting them in AL-02. Thanks for having me!
VISITING THE AEROMEDICAL RESEARCH LABORATORY 
￼ 
I stopped by Fort Rucker to tour the aeromedical research laboratory. I spoke with many of the employees about the importance of Army Aviation and the exciting innovation happening on post. Great visit! 
THIS WEEK ON THE ROAD 
I am looking forward to another busy week on the road. I'll be discussing a number of topics including Army Aviation, strengthening our local school systems, addressing mental illness, and community revitalization. Remember that you can follow along with me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.        
It is an honor to serve you in Congress. Please never hesitate to let me know if there is a way my office can be of assistance.   Sincerely,

Dear Friends, 
This Saturday, August 25, will be the one-year anniversary since Hurricane Harvey landed on our shores. As we approach this anniversary, I know there is much that still needs to be done to fully recover. From day one, I have offered my office’s full assistance to state and local officials to ensure Texas has all the tools and resources we need. That is why I supported Governor Abbott’s request for an expedited major disaster declaration, and applauded President Trump for his swift approval, so that our first responders had the vital plans and assets in place even prior to the storm landing on our shores.
Here is a look back on my work fighting for the Houston area following the devastation of Harvey. You can click here or on the image below to watch me leading recovery efforts immediately following the storm. 
￼ 
 Immediately following the dreadful days of unprecedented rain and historic flooding, I was on the ground to witness the resolve of my fellow Texans firsthand and hear the stories of heroic acts that saved thousands of lives.
￼ 
It was with these stories in mind that I returned to Washington to demand Congress pass the first of three rounds of federal disaster funding for victims of Hurricane Harvey. This was the first $15.25 billion of the nearly $140 billion in total approved by Congress for disaster funding.    
￼ 
Early in the recovery, I was shown a 1940 Army Corps map detailing the construction of a levee system in the vicinity of Cypress Creek that was never built.  
￼ 
My top priority quickly became finding the proper infrastructure solution to mitigate future flooding disasters.In Katy, I held a press conference with local officials to raise awareness about the importance and necessity of a solution on Cypress Creek. In Washington, I fought for the funding to study and ultimately begin construction on this mitigation project. I am proud to say that OMB and the Army Corps have recently approved the $6 million needed to begin the study to ensure we find the best solution. This study must be done expediently, and I’m glad the House passed my amendment in Water Resources and Development Act to accelerate studies and disaster recovery projects in the Houston region. 
￼ 
Last September, I toured Cypress Creek with Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster to show him the flooding issues facing the Houston area and the urgent need to fix them. The following month, I testified before his committee about the importance of a long-term solution and expediting critical funding. In recent months, I have also met with the Army Corps Assistant Secretary for Civil Works and OMB Director Mick Mulvaney. In all of these meetings, I continue to stress that we cannot afford to wait.
You can click here or on the image below to watch my full testimony before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.  
￼ 
In March, I chaired a Homleand Security Committe hearing in Washington to ask federal officials and state and local stakeholders about lessons learned from Harvey. The hearing focused on the strong coordination on the local, state, and federal levels with FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers. I highlighted the importance of this strong coordination with FEMA Administrator Brock Long and pushed for my number one priority – the Cypress Creek solution – with Reed Clay from Governor Abbott's office and Major General Jackson from the Army Corps of Engineers.  
You can click here or on the image below to watch my opening remarks from this committee hearing. 
￼ 
The following month, I chaired a Homeland Security Committee field hearing in Cypress to highlight the lessons learned from Hurricane Harvey and discuss the importance of protecting the Houston region from future flooding. I discussed with state and local officials the need to expedite the Army Corps study so that we can find a solution for Cypress Creek and prevent future disasters. I also pushed for answers about the overnight release of water from Addicks and Barker reservoirs during Hurricane Harvey. Following the hearing, I sent a letter to Lieutenant General Todd Semonite, Commanding General of the Army Corps of Engineers, to find out if the Corps adequately shared information with state and local officials to properly warn residents of the release of water. 
￼ 
In total, Congress has appropriated $140 billion in disaster relief and recovery funding for storm victims. This is a lot of desperately needed money and resources coming to help Texans as we approach the one-year anniversary of Harvey. The money has been appropriated as follows: 
	•	$50 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund to aid hurricane relief victims
	•	$35.4 billion in HUD Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) housing assistance to aid those whose homes were impacted by hurricanes
	•	$17.4 billion to the Army Corps
The federal government and the Texas delegation has done our part and now it is time for the state and local officials to act, and that is exactly what Harris County Judge Ed Emmet is doing with the bond referendum. I stand by willing to help however my office can as we continue to move forward, further recover, and push for infrastructure solutions to mitigate future flooding.  
Even a year later, I remain inspired by the the most compassionate humanitarian response I have ever witnessed. It let me know immediately, even though things seemed bleak last year, that we would recover. Because we are Texas Strong.
As always, I encourage you to visit my website, www.mccaul.house.gov, for more information on constituent services and legislative updates. Also, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube to get the latest updates on my work in Washington and the 10th District of Texas. It continues to be a great honor to represent you in the United States House of Representatives.  
With Best Regards, ￼  Michael T. McCaul Member of Congress

Kansas Common Sense  August 20, 2018
Hello,
 
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.
 
Meeting with Judge Kavanaugh
This week, I met with Judge Brett Kavanaugh to discuss his qualifications to be the next Supreme Court justice. Our discussion further affirmed he is a man of integrity and intellect with a deep respect for the Constitution. I look forward to his confirmation hearing next month. 
 ￼ 
Questioning FCC Commissioners in Commerce Committee Hearing As a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, I participated in an oversight hearing for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Thursday. During the hearing, I questioned the FCC Commissioners on economic competitiveness issues dependent on rural communities’ access to high-speed broadband, including the long-term sustainability and predictability of the Universal Service Fund’s High Cost Program and the Mobility Fund Phase II’s eligibility map. These issues remain critical to allow broadband providers in rural Kansas to effectively target federal resources to close the Digital Divide. Investment in and deployment of broadband in our largest population centers is well-established, but many in rural communities are currently unable to connect to the rest of the world. I am thankful to have the opportunity to ask these important questions and look forward to working with the Commissioners to resolve these issues. Click here to view my full questioning. 
 ￼ 
Honoring the Life of Ed Rolfs This week I attended the funeral of my long-time friend Ed Rolfs of Junction City. Ed had a distinguished career in banking, leading Central National Bank for a number of years. He was also a dedicated leader in his community having served in a number of community and state-wide civic organizations, was deeply involved in his church, and was a veteran of World War II and the Korean Conflict. 
Ed served his country, community, business and family in a dedicated fashion – he will be truly missed. His work ethic, strong moral values and innovative spirit made Junction City and the entire state of Kansas a better place. Robba and I are praying for the Rolfs as they celebrate Ed’s life together. 
Introducing the DRIVE-Safe Act This week, I joined my colleagues Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Jim Inhofe (R-OK) in introducing the Developing Responsible Individuals for a Vibrant Economy (DRIVE-Safe) Act to address the driver shortage in the trucking and logistics industry, and enhance safety training and job opportunities for young truckers. Currently, federal law prohibits those under 21 who have obtained a commercial driver’s licenses from moving goods from state to state. The DRIVE-Safe Act would not only create a training program that, once completed, would allow young drivers to operate a commercial vehicle across state lines prior to their 21st birthday, but also ensure younger drivers are trained beyond current standards while instituting rigorous safety standards and performance benchmarks. If passed, the DRIVE-Safe Act would open up new career opportunities previously unavailable for our young Kansans. 
Meeting with Mayors from Across the State On Thursday morning with a number of city officials from across Kansas in my Washington, D.C. office. We discussed a number of issues including the effects of the trade tariffs, immigration and the need for high-skilled labor, the importance of career and technical education, and transportation and infrastructure. In addition, I provided an update on my work to preserve train service on the Southwest Chief. Thank you to the city officials from Dodge City, Emporia, Great Bend, Lawrence, Leavenworth, Lenexa, Manhattan, Newton, Olathe, Overland Park and Prairie Village, as well as the League of Kansas Municipalities for our discussion. 
 ￼
Hosting Kansas Listening Tour Stops in Yates Center and Fredonia Wilson County Thank you to residents of Wilson County for attending my Kansas Listening Tour stop on Friday. At the townhall meeting in Fredonia, we discussed a number of issues including agriculture and the importance of the Farm Bill, education, healthcare, economic development and veterans’ healthcare and the VA MISSION Act. I answered questions regarding the escalating trade war and its effects on Kansas farmers, ranchers and manufacturers, the role Congress plays in tariffs decisions, as well as potential collaboration between state and federal officials on Lake Neodesha. Thank you to Susan John of Fredonia Regional Hospital for hosting my visit and to Neodesha Mayor Terry Harper, State Senator Bruce Givens, and former State Representative Mary Compton for attending.
 ￼
Woodson County I appreciate the many Yates Center residents who took time to visit with me during my Kansas Listening Tour in Woodson County. In Yates Center, we discussed many of the same issues and I had the chance to hear from various residents on issues important to them. Thanks Woodson County Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Dakota McNett, USD 366 Superintendent Greg Brown, Treasurer Theresa McNett, board clerk Glenda Howard for taking time to visit with me.
 ￼
Coffey County  On Friday, I stopped in Burlington to visit local businesses and organizations to discuss issues facing Burlington and Coffey County. I also shared an update on things I'm working on in Washington, D.C. Thanks to the many Burlington residents for taking time to visit with me on Friday.

The Webster Wire
Listening to Floridians
Dear Friends: 
Last week was National Health Center Week. Community Health Centers provide our communities with accessible primary care, dental care, behavioral health and pharmacy services, particularly in underserved rural and urban areas. While at Heart of Florida Health Center in Belleview and Langley Health Services in Inverness, I saw firsthand how the health care staff are providing essential services and compassionate care in our communities. 
￼ 
_______________ 
It was a pleasure to meet Diane Schofield, Founder & CEO of Hands of Mercy Everywhere, in Belleview and tour their home for teenage girls, teen mothers, and their babies. I was also pleased to donate four backpacks full of school supplies for the teens they serve. 
￼ 
_______________ 
I enjoyed visiting with friends and members of the Leesburg Noon Rotary. We discussed the benefits of Tax Reform, as well as tariffs, farm subsidies and more. They also thanked me for the work of my office helping constituents with IRS and VA related issues. I was also inducted as an honorary member of the Leesburg High School Interact Club and pledged to support the club’s initiative to stop bullying. 
￼ 
_______________ 
Opioid addiction is a crisis that is claiming more than 100 American lives every day. Providing law enforcement, the healthcare industry, and local communities the tools to combat this crisis has been a priority of the U.S. House of Representatives. Thank you to Marion County Children’s Alliance and the Marion County Heroin/Opioid Task Force for hosting Florida Congressional District 11 Opioid Crisis Roundtable. We heard from community leaders and local partners who are on the front lines every day to learn more about their daily work and how we can be a better partner. 
￼
￼

______________ 
It was also great to visit with CareerSource Citrus Levy Marion at their Ocala Career Center to discuss workforce development and hear about the many services they offer throughout our communities. 
￼
_______________ 
I toured the Kimberly’s Center for Child Protection in Marion County and visited with staff and board members. I commend and thank Kimberly’s Center for their dedication to protect, serve, and advocate for abused and neglected children. 
￼ 
_______________ 
I have the pleasure of being actively involved with Habitat for Humanity for many years, supporting their efforts with funding and joining some of the home-building projects. It was special to be able to participate in their Marion County home dedication for both the Monroe and Grant families. As part of the dedication, I was honored to plant a tree in the backyard of the Monroe home & present the house keys to the Grant family.
￼ 
_______________ 
Manufacturing is an important job creator in our country and my district.  Local quarries, concrete, gravel and composite material plants across the district are critical partners in building infrastructure and strong buildings. It was great to stop by and visit with some of the staff at Consolidated Minerals in Leesburg.

Constituent Corner
A constituent from Tavares filed an appeal as her application for VA benefits had been denied and she was concerned there was a delay. My office submitted an inquiry on her behalf and learned from the VA that evidence provided in the appeal would have qualified her for the original benefits. Unfortunately, this was now tied up in the appeals process. Forms were submitted to withdraw the appeal to re-apply for benefits. In under six weeks, the family received word that the benefits had been approved.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.  
District Update
Congratulations to all the participants at the 2018 Sumter County 4-H Awards Banquet. It was great meeting Corbin and Claysen who were part of the program, and their mother, Rachel, who baked this delicious cake. 
￼
  
Legislative Update 
On Tuesday, President Trump signed into law S.770, Senate companion to my bill, H.R. 2105, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Small Business Cybersecurity Act. Introduced last year, the bill will help small businesses better address their cybersecurity risks to help them survive - and thrive - in the face of such adversity. 
This bill will provide small businesses in my district, state and across the country with the tools they need to meet the threats and challenges of the modern world. These small businesses are more susceptible to attacks due to the limited access to the tools they need to prepare for such an event. 
The bill directs the NIST Director to disseminate clear and concise resources, which are defined as guidelines, tools, best practices, standards, methodologies, and other ways of providing information. Implementation of the NIST Framework into these small businesses will protect business owners, their employees, and their customer base, all while contributing positively to the economy.  
As the owner of a multi-generational small business, I know what small businesses can accomplish when equipped and empowered with the right tools. Recently, when my own business was attacked, I experienced the havoc a hacker can cause and the importance of cybersecurity. I thank President Trump for swiftly signing this bill into law.

￼

￼

￼  ￼  ￼ 
Dear Friend, 

As you may have seen, on Friday the President issued a major disaster declaration for Lake County for the Mendocino Complex Fires, allowing federal funds to be available to help our community recover from these terrible fires. These resources are a critical step in our journey to rebuild and I am proud to have joined so many in our delegation to fight for this important declaration. 

Starting August 21st there will be a Disaster Recovery Center open daily from 9 am to 7 pm at 940 Main Street in Upper Lake where you can talk to experts about your options and resources available to you to help recover. I have also put together a disaster guide to help you and your family navigate the recovery process. You can click here to download and read that guide. Individuals who may be eligible for individual assistance should apply through one of the following options. 
	•	Apply by phone to FEMA: 1-800-621-FEMA (3362).  Disaster assistance applicants, who have a speech disability or hearing loss and use TTY, should call 1-800-462-7585 directly; for those who use 711 or Video Relay Service (VRS), call 1-800-621-3362. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time seven days a week until further notice.
	•	You can also apply online anytime at www.DisasterAssistance.gov.
	•	By smartphone or tablet, use www.fema.gov.
Please know you can always contact my office if you have questions about fire recovery, the disaster declaration, or any other issues. Together, we will recover and come back even stronger. 
Sincerely,
￼

Fixing the Affordable Housing Crisis 
We are facing an affordable housing crisis in our country and it’s affecting Hoosiers in Indiana. The consequences of the affordable housing crisis are far reaching and impact everything from education, to the ability to find a job. Over the last two weeks, I’ve visited 20 counties across Indiana meeting with Hoosiers and making the pitch for Congress to fix the housing affordability crisis in the United States. Last month, I introduced bipartisan legislation to help address this growing problem. Watch the news clips below to learn more.

A win-win-win in Gary 
Abandoned buildings in Gary are a haven for crime and drug use. It’s time that these properties are demolished. It is great to have the Indiana National Guard partnering with the city of Gary to save taxpayer dollars and strengthen our community.
CLTV News spoke to Hoosiers in Gary about the project here: 
￼ 
Keeping the Crossroads of America Strong 
Indiana is the Crossroads of America, and the truck driver shortage has a significant impact on our state. As I’ve traveled throughout Indiana, I have heard from Hoosiers that a pathway is needed to qualify more drivers to move goods safely and efficiently. That’s why I introduced the DRIVE-Safe Act to help address the driver shortage, enhance safety, and create new career opportunities for young Hoosiers. 
Learn what my colleagues and the trucking industry is saying. 
We Must Address the Ethnic Cleansing in Burma 
Last week, I sent a letter with Senators Merkley, Rubio, Durbin, and 13 other colleagues pressing the administration to address the brutal ethnic cleansing in Burma. Read the full letter here.

8/20/18 17:36,Re: Legislation for you,"￼ 


Hoosiers,

It's an honor to serve each and every Hoosier of Indiana's 9th Congressional District every day. Across the District, from Bloomington to Jeffersonville, hearing your thoughts, ideas, and concerns is the most important part of my job. In fact, multiple pieces of legislation that I have introduced in the House of Representatives have stemmed from conversations with Hoosiers:

Location
Salem, IN

Legislation
Black Vulture Farm Bill Amendment

Background
At an agriculture townhall in Washington County, a Hoosier farmer shared his story about how black vultures are destroying livestock. Thanks to his feedback, I introduced an amendment to the 2018 Farm Bill to allow cattle farmers to better protect their livestock from predatory black vultures, which passed with unanimous consent.

￼

Location
Jeffersonville, IN

Legislation 
DRIVE-Safe Act

Background
During tours of businesses across the District, various trucking, grocers, and retail companies and chambers of commerce shared their concerns about the truck driver shortage facing our country's economy. To address this problem, I introduced the DRIVE-Safe Act, which creates a training program to help more Hoosiers find high-skilled jobs, better pay, and brighter futures.

￼

Location
New Albany, IN

Legislation 
POLICE Act

Background
Floyd County Sheriff Frank Loop wrote my office a letter to share a problem his officers were facing in the line of duty. Together, Sheriff Loop and I authored the POLICE Act to remove a double standard so police officers can better protect themselves and the communities they serve.

￼

I'm here to ensure your voice is heard every day in Washington and to fight for a federal government that puts your interests first. If you have any thoughts or concerns you would like to share with me, please do not hesitate to reach out. I look forward to hearing from you!

Be of good cheer,
￼

Last Week in Congress
Small Business Optimism Hits 35-Year High
￼ Click here to read more from the NFIB
Our pro-growth policies of tax and regulatory reform have kicked the economy into high gear, and businesses and job creators across the country are reporting their optimism about the direction we're heading. The National Federation of Independent Business's measure of small business optimism recently hit its highest point in 35 years, and is nearly at the highest point ever. Small businesses everywhere are reporting that they want to expand their operations and add more jobs. In July, small businesses added the largest number of new workers per firm since 2006. They are also reporting plans to raise pay and benefits for workers. Now, the next challenge will be to get more Americans trained and qualified for the 21st century jobs that small businesses need to fill, and I have been working to support education programs that get more people ready for the workforce. 
￼
President Signs NDAA into Law
￼
Last week, President Trump signed into law the Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to give our troops the largest pay raise in 9 years. This bill is also a positive step towards rebuilding our armed forces, restoring our military readiness and agility, and committing to a strong national defense plan. America faces many different strategic threats, from the re-emergence of Russia and China to the ongoing War of Terror, and this bill provides our military men and women with the equipment and support they deserve to keep them safe and to carry out their important mission. The House worked hard to get this bill done so that we could get vital resources to our servicemembers as quickly as possible, and I am pleased to report that this is the earliest Congress has completed an NDAA bill since 1977.

Around the District
Tax Reform Rally
￼ Kevin at the rally with small business owners, employees, and local officials
I was honored to be recognized by the Job Creators Network for my support of small businesses and tax cuts last week. I joined them for a rally in Overland Park with small business owners, employees, and community leaders to celebrate the positive impact that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is having on our local economy. 
Thanks to our economic growth agenda of reforming taxes, reducing regulations, and investing in things like infrastructure and education, today the American worker is better off than they have been in decades. Unemployment is the lowest it's been since 1969, we've added more manufacturing jobs than any point since 1995, and we have the lowest small business tax rate since 1931. We've seen businesses across the country give bonuses and raises to millions of workers in addition to creating new jobs and making new hires. I look forward to building on these successes and continuing to enact policies that will grow wages even faster and keep our economy strong.
￼
KC Cares Radio
￼ Kevin with Ruth Bigus and Sunayana Dumala
It was a pleasure joining Ruth Bigus of the KC Cares radio show, along with my friend Sunayana Dumala, to talk about the importance of charity and giving back to our community. In 2017, Americans gave a total of $410 billion to charity, the equivalent of 2.1% of our total economy. I supported the preservation of the charitable contribution deduction in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and I believe that this deduction, along with increased take-home pay for Americans taxpayers, will lead to more charitable giving in our country.
Sunayana and I talked to KC Cares about her story of losing her husband in a tragic hate crime, and then turning her grief into motivation to make a positive change in our community. Her new initiative, Forever Welcome, helps immigrants feel more welcome to the United States. Helping Sunayana is one of my proudest accomplishments in Congress, and I am glad to stand alongside her in this important effort to increase love and acceptance.

Health Partnership Clinic of Johnson County
￼ Kevin and Brooke with Brenda McLaughlin, Amy Falk, Carolyn Thomas, Catherine Rice, and Gerorge Reffner
Last week was National Health Center Week, and I visited the Health Partnership Clinic (HPC) of Johnson County in Olathe. HPC works hard to meet the health care needs of the underserved and medically vulnerable kids and families in Johnson County. Earlier this year, I was proud to support the increased federal funding to make this essential work possible across the country. Thank you to Amy Falk and the staff for all you do to provide access to affordable comprehensive primary care. 
￼
Fairfax Industrial Association in KCK
￼ Kevin speaking to the Fairfax Industrial Association
Last week, I spoke to the Fairfax Industrial Association at WestPro Construction Solutions in the Fairfax area of KCK. I heard from them about the strong economy, low unemployment, and importance of manufacturing. Manufacturing is a large and vital part of our economy, employing 12.5 million Americans, including 160,700 in Kansas. Manufacturing employment been growing at a rapid pace, adding 327,000 jobs in the last year. This is the largest 12 month gain for this sector since 1995. Thank you to Melissa Clark for your leadership and to the large crowd who came with great questions and comments.
￼
ZERO Prostate Cancer
￼ Kevin with Vivian Avery
I enjoyed meeting with Vivian Avery, Regional Champion with ZERO - The End of Prostate Cancer, last week to talk about how we can work together in the fight against prostate cancer. In Kansas, it is estimated that 1,360 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year, with the risk highest for veterans and African-American men. In Congress, I will continue to support increased research funding at the federal level and promote early detection to save lives in Kansas and across the nation. Thank you to Vivian for her inspiring work to end prostate cancer.

Former Third District Representative Jan Meyers
￼ Kevin with former Representative Meyers
Former Rep. Jan Meyers represented our District for 12 years and was the first Republican woman elected to the U.S. House from Kansas. I enjoy sitting down with Jan to seek her advice as she is a mentor to me. I admire her sweet disposition and always value our times together. We discussed some of the Members still in the House that served with her, current legislative issues, and her time as chair of the House Small Business Committee.

Congressional Awards for Two Third District Students
￼ Kevin with Alayna Donovan and her mother and sister  ￼ Kevin with Annelise Ewy and her family
Last week I had the honor of awarding the Congressional Silver Medal to Alayna Donovan, a recent high school graduate from the Olathe School District, and the Congressional Bronze Medal to Annelise Ewy, a student in the Blue Valley School District. They each set challenging goals for themselves to achieve awards through voluntary public service, personal development, physical fitness, and exploration. Congrats Alayna and Annelise on behalf of the Third District of Kansas; we are proud of you and this prestigious accomplishment.
￼
Association for Advanced Life Underwriting
￼ Kevin with Matt McAvoy
It was great meeting with Matt McAvoy, President of Northwestern Target Insurance Services in Overland Park and a member of the Association for Advanced Life Underwriting (AALU). He and I discussed the importance of life insurance for families and businesses in Kansas. Plus, we talked about tax reform and how it is helping his business grow and thrive. 
￼
Service Academy Nomination Applications
￼ Kevin with past nominees, Jessica Broll and Annalise Holland
Each year I have the privilege of nominating bright young men and women from the Third Congressional District to four of the five U.S. Service Academies: U.S. Military Academy (USMA), U.S. Naval Academy (USNA), U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA), and U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA).

Judge Quattlebaum Confirmation  It is a great day for South Carolina as fellow South Carolinians Judge Marvin Quattlebaum and Assistant United States Attorney Jay Richardson were both recently confirmed as United States Circuit Judge-Designates for the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Quattlebaum’s exemplary record shines from years of practicing law in Greenville and his philanthropic work advocating for our nation’s youth through his leadership at the YMCA and the Marcus Lattimore Foundation. AUSA Richardson also has an impressive record and is best known for serving as the lead prosecutor in the Dylann Roof trial. You can read my full statement here.   Opportunity Tour: WV  On Friday, I continued my national Opportunity Tour and joined Sen. Shelley Moore Capito in West Virginia, where we toured opportunity zones in the Huntington area. We met with many local leaders, including Mayor Williams and Rep. Jenkins. I was happy to have many productive discussions with both public and private sector folks who recognize the economic challenges this area has faced & how they think the opportunity zones program can help make a difference. You can read a full recap of our stops here, and read our joint Op-Ed from the WV Gazette-Mail here.   ￼   ￼   ￼   Sincerely, ￼  Tim

 LAST WEEK, REP. SOTO'S 3 AMENDMENTS WERE SIGNED INTO LAW
	•	Permanent Authorization of Defense Exportability Program Amendment – Permanently authorizes the Defense Exportability Feature Pilot Program, which encourages program management to design and develop technology protection features in systems during the research and development state. Specifically, this program implements anti-tamper technologies and other system engineering activities meant to prevent or delay exploitation of critical technologies. This program supports BRIDG activities, which helps develop devices that are resistant to malicious tampering while developing techniques to harden devices.   
	•	PTSD Pilot Program for Military Sexual Trauma  – This amendment added universities to the list of entities authorized to partner with the Department of Defense’s pilot program on treatment of members of the armed forces for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to military sexual trauma. By including universities to the list of entities that can participate in this intensive outpatient program, the University of Central Florida’s RESTORES program can now qualify for this important pilot program.   
	•	Resources Available for Exiting Service Members that were Victims of Military Sexual Assault – This amendment requires the inclusion of resources available to treat victims of military sexual trauma as part of the required service member pre-separation counseling.
REPRESENTING YOU
I've continued to visit and meet with constituents all throughout our district. I attended the grand opening of the LGBT Center in downtown Kissimmee, stopped by the Central Avenue Elementary School open house to wish our students a great new school year, visited the new St. Cloud Regional Medical Center, joined the Osceola Council on Aging Breakfast, and met with our friends at the Osceola County Chamber of Commerce.

I was proud to cosponsor this critical legislation, which takes steps to establish a 3-digit suicide prevention & mental health crisis hotline so folks can get help in their time of need.  RepPeteOlson  REMINDER: The deadline for folks to file #Harvey NFIP Proof of Loss Claims is fast approaching!

Thank you for your commitment to reporting the news that affects our Fort Bend County & #TX22 community. Here’s to many more! ￼ 
Dear Friend,  Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to read about some of last week’s highlights here in Texas.  Welcoming the Next Generation of Young Leaders  Saturday, I was excited to meet the new members of my 2018-2019 Congressional Youth Advisory Council (CYAC). The CYAC is a group of exceptional high school students that meet with me to discuss the legislative process and the issues that are important to them. These students provide critical insight into the issues that affect our next generation of leaders and help me better convey their concerns to my colleagues in Washington. Our first meeting was focused on introducing students to the legislative process. I’m looking forward to seeing what these bright students accomplish this year. ￼  Rep. Olson and members of the 2018-2019 Congressional Youth Advisory Council   Having a Dialogue with the Central Fort Bend Chamber of Commerce  On a recent visit with the Central Fort Bend Chamber of Commerce, we discussed Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts, flood prevention and energy and tax reform policies. Business and civic leaders from throughout the greater Fort Bend area asked questions about how these federal policies will affect both their businesses and our community as a whole. Events like these help me to hear directly about how these policies impact our district and allow me to better represent our community in Congress. ￼  Rep. Olson speaks with Matt Breazeale and provides an update on Congress to CFBCC Members   Celebrating India’s Independence  It was an honor to celebrate India’s 72nd Independence Day at the Consulate General of India in Houston, and speak about the partnership between our great nations and the contributions Indo-Americans bring to the United States and to our local community. The relationship between the United States and India is special, especially here in the Houston region. Our countries share a special bond as the world's oldest democracy and the world's largest democracy. Our ties will only grow stronger as our shared values open the way for commercial trade, providing mutual security and economic benefit. ￼  Rep. Olson speaking at the Consulate General of India in Houston Indian Independence Day celebration   Honoring a TX-22 Vietnam Veteran  As a former Navy pilot, the veterans who have sacrificed so much on behalf of our nation are my heroes. Many of these veterans performed heroic deeds during their military service, but never received medals earned for their valor, or misplaced them over the years. That’s why it was such a privilege to present Army veteran Mr. Rudy Sanchez with his long-overdue medals for his service in Vietnam. Upon learning he never received recognition for his heroism, my staff and I worked with the Department of Defense to secure his medals for him. It was an honor to present Mr. Sanchez with his long-overdue medals which included: the Army Commendation Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service medal with 4 bronze stars, Combat Infantry badge 1st Award, and Republic of Vietnam Campaign Ribbon. If you or a veteran you know have earned medals of distinction, but either failed to receive them or lost them over the years, please contact my Pearland office at (281) 485-4855.  My staff and I would be honored to help with replacing a lost medal or securing an earned medal. ￼  Rep. Olson presented Mr. Sanchez with his medals and thanked him for his service in in the US Army in Vietnam   State Department Announces Houston Passport Day  Do you need to renew your passport or apply for the first time?

Dear Friend: 
“We are hostages in our own homes.” That’s how Jennifer, a mother from Medford, described to me what communities in Southern Oregon and across the West are enduring yet again: a summer filled with smoke and fire. 

Jennifer continued in her letter to me saying, “my children are robbed of being able to play outside. I absolutely hate that nothing is done to prevent this from happening.” 
As I traveled throughout Southern Oregon in recent weeks, I met with concerned citizens, veterans, small business owners, and community leaders who had the same deep frustration as Jennifer. I share that frustration as well, as do people I meet with throughout our state. 
Year after year, we are suffering from the effects of catastrophic wildfires and the smoke that comes with it. Our airsheds are choked and smoke blankets our communities, giving us some of the worst air quality in the world this summer. 
We cannot accept this as our “new normal.” The only way to fix this problem that impacts us all is to fix the broken policies that have led to these overstocked forests and unnaturally catastrophic wildfires in the first place. 
As Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I announced that we are going to hold a hearing this fall to examine the health consequences of the smoke from these fires and explore the various contributing factors, from climate change to overstocked forests. This hearing will serve as an opportunity to address the current state of our forests and what policy changes need to be made. 
In parts of Oregon, our forests are packed with nearly 1,000 trees per acre on land that historically had 20 trees per acre -- a clear sign that our forests are overstocked and need to be restored to their natural balance. 
Moreover, a recent study by The Nature Conservancy, Forest Service, and others found that fuel management projects can reduce the size and intensity of fire up to 70 percent and reduce carbon emissions from the fire by up to 85 percent. 
That’s why we need to give our forest managers additional tools to remove the excess fuel loads that have built up in our forests. 
To help mitigate the risk of these fires, we need to speed up and increase our work in the woods. 
And after fires, we should remove the burned, dead trees -- where appropriate and while they still have value -- and use the proceeds to pay for replanting a new, healthy forest for the next generation. That’s called stewardship, and that’s what happens on private, county and state lands. These needed reforms were included in the Farm Bill that passed the House earlier this year with my support. Unfortunately, the Senate’s version of the legislation failed to include these common-sense changes. 
As negotiations on the final bill proceed, it’s time for the Senate to act and include these needed provisions. 
The Farm Bill builds on the progress we made toward fixing federal forest policy earlier this year when we passed into law the most significant reforms in over a decade. 
We provided the Forest Service with tools for rapid implementation of wildfire resiliency and hazardous fuels reduction projects. 
And we took steps to fix fire borrowing starting in 2020, which will help end the vicious cycle of depleting resources for fire prevention to pay for fire suppression. 
This progress is important, but we have a long way to go. Nearly 30 years of poor management have created a tinderbox in our federal forests that ignites every summer. It will take significant time and effort to restore balance to our public lands. 
But we must push forward. Working together with people on the ground in Oregon, my colleagues in Congress, and the administration, I am confident that we can continue moving in a better direction for communities across the West, our airsheds, water sheds, and federal lands. 
I’ve heard the same message loud and clear from Oregonians like Jennifer no matter where I go in our state: something needs to change in the way we manage our forests. I am committed to making that change happen. 
It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. Congress. 
Best regards, 
Greg Walden U.S. Representative Oregon's Second District

Friends, 
The Iowa State Fair is an event I look forward to every year. This year, I made it to the fair for 10 days and met thousands of Iowans from across the Third District and the entire state. The state fair brings together people from every corner of Iowa, from other states, and even other countries.  
￼ 
I wanted to share with you some of what I did during this year's Iowa State Fair. I hosted the Japanese Consul General Naoki Ito last week. We talked about trade and the potential for new trading opportunities between the United States and Japan.  
￼ 
I hosted Environmental Protection Agency Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler at the fair on Monday with Governor Kim Reynolds. I invited him to Iowa last month so he could hear directly from the folks I represent about the need for a strong Renewable Fuel Standard and year-round E-15.  
￼ 
And of course we all had to flip a few pork burgers while he was here!  
￼
I spent some time at the Iowa Turkey Federation stand and served up some turkey legs. Did you know Iowa farmers produce the turkey for over 1,000 turkey sandwiches every minute? 
￼
Iowa Corn took over the grand concourse Friday afternoon to talk to folks about all the uses of corn. From food for livestock, to biofuels and biodegradable utensils, corn has many uses. And of course, one of the most important uses for corn is inside a bag for cornhole!  
Those are just a few of the things I did during the 10 days of this year's Iowa State Fair. As always, please share your thoughts and concerns with me through my website and stay up to date on my travels throughout the Third District on my Facebook and Twitter pages.  
Take care,

Friend,  
I hope you've had an enjoyable and relaxing summer with friends and family. I wanted to reach out and give you an update on what's been going on down in Washington this summer. Since May, I've worked to pass three legislative provisions through the House of Representatives which will help veterans, fight the heroin and opioid epidemic, and invest in our failing infrastructure. Read more about my legislation below and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.  
￼  
The transition from the military can be a difficult time for veterans. Some veterans struggle with finding a good job, adjusting to family life, or just feeling at home in the civilian world. Some even battle mental health issues or substance abuse. Veterans Service Officers (VSOs) are available to assist these new veterans, but the VSOs have no way of knowing that a recently discharged veteran has returned home or moved to their community. 
My bill would change all that. The Know Your Vets Act would give veterans the option to have their final certificate of discharge paperwork sent to a county VSO based on the location of their retirement from service. This notification will allow VSOs to proactively reach out to offer assistance and ensure that the new veteran has a smooth transition back to civilian life. Our vets deserve the very best, and ensuring they have the help they need during their transition out of military service is our responsibility. Read more here.  
￼ 
In every communtiy I visit in the Hudson Valley, I hear stories of heartbreak and loss associated with the heroin and opioid epidemic. We have to fight this epidemic using every tool in our toolbox, and that means ensuring our law enforcement community has the tools and directives they need to get the job done. I was proud to introduce the Stop Online Opioid Sales Act in February - and now I've worked to pass it through the House of Representatives.  
My legislation will require the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) to collect information on online drug sales and issue an annual report to inform a solution to combating the problem. Because there is no comprehensive reporting on the sale of drugs through the internet, the Senate investigated the issue and earlier this year issued a report indicating that Americans acquired $800 million in fentanyl from China alone over the past two years.The problem is, we don't know where else these drugs are coming from. We need to know more in order to stop them. My legislation will ensure we do. Read more here.  
￼ 
Did you know that nearly 100 dams in the Hudson Valley are rated as ""high-hazard?"" Dam safety may not sound like the most exciting subject, but that perception would change in a hurry if one of our dams in the Hudson Valley failed during a storm and folks lose their homes, their livelihoods, and even their lives. That's why I worked to pass the Dam Safety Reauthorization Act through the House of Representatives earlier this summer. The legislation would reauthorize the National Dam Safety Program (NDSP) through 2024. This critical program provides support to states like New York in developing Emergency Action Plans (EAPs), public awareness campaigns, the implementation of existing dam safety programs, the purchase of equipment, and dam safety inspections to protect our communities from flooding. Read more here.  
My office is here to help if you have any issues with federal agencies or if you have additional questions. Please don't hesitate to reach out to my office in Newburgh at (845) 561-1259.  
  
Sincerely,

Walker Featured in USA TODAY: ""A GOP Leader Looks to Recast His Party's Image with Black Voters""
￼
Congressman Mark Walker today was featured in a story by USA Today, ""In Donald Trump era, a GOP leader looks to recast his party's image with black voters.""  The article highlights Walker's outreach efforts and his determination to expand the conservative message of opportunity and individual liberty to new communities. The story reads:  ""Walker, an affable former pastor, represents a North Carolina district that is one-fifth African-American. He is championing criminal justice reform and adequate funding for historically black colleges and universities, issues that are high priorities for many African-American voters.  ""The lawmaker is working on legislation that would allow student athletes – many of whom are black – to be compensated for their publicity rights. Walker also has hosted two Washington summits with HBCU leaders, meetings that helped pave the way for year-round Pell grants for HBCU students. He teamed up with North Carolina Democratic Rep. Alma Adams to establish an internship program for students from HBCUs. Walker also was the first Republican in years to give a keynote address at the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus Foundation dinner in June. All of the group's members are Democrats.  ...  'Walker took the findings to heart during his first run for Congress in 2014, when he sought the support of local Democratic leader the Rev. Odell Cleveland. It took three meetings for Walker to win over the pastor, including a chat in Cleveland's office, coffee together at McDonald's and a small group lunch they attended together.   ""'I’m a lifelong Democrat and proud of it, but I just believe we have to find common ground,' Cleveland said. He added he still 'vehemently' disagrees with some of Walker’s votes, like one to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but he likes him.  ...  ""Walker and other Republicans may find an opening with African-Americans who feel the Democratic Party is taking their vote for granted and parachuting in at the last minute to get their support. Sabrina Singh, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, said the party learned in 2016 that it needs to start organizing in minority communities earlier and has been since.  ""For her part, Anita Estell head of CELIE, a nonprofit focused on civic engagement, said she didn’t think the focus on Trump should prevent people from listening to Walker. Estell said she’d be happy to engage with Walker on diversity.  ""'I come from an era where Democrats and Republicans worked together,' Estell said. 'If Mark Walker is trying to be a public servant for all of the residents of North Carolina, God bless him.'""

WEEKLY WRAP-UP 

￼
I was honored to present a copy of the Congressional Gold Medal to Libertyville resident Howard Pollari. Howard is a WWII veteran who served in the OSS, the precursor to the CIA, and was a flight engineer during moonlight “carpetbagger” operations to deliver supplies to resistance fighters and allies in Nazi-occupied Norway. Congress previously passed legislation to award the Congressional Gold Medal in recognition of the service of more than 13,000 OSS veterans who served during the war.
  
  
￼ 
I appreciated the opportunity to visit GAM Enterprises today in Mt Prospect and learn more about the opportunities and challenges facing manufacturers in our district.
  
￼ 
I enjoyed visiting with residents of Heritage Woods of Gurnee. We had a great conversation about ways to safeguard Medicare and ensure our seniors can be secure in their retirement.

￼ 
I was glad to kick-off a morning last week with the Libertyville Sunrise Rotary Club and share an update from Washington. I enjoyed our conversation about ways we are working to deter Russian interference, enhance cyber security and improve our nation’s infrastructure. 
  
￼ 
Last week, I toured Winthrop Harbor with local officials and discussed their downtown redevelopment plans, shoreline restoration and habitat protection.

Dear Lindsey, 
I had another busy week meeting with folks across Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District! To kick things off, I visited aerospace, safety, and medical manufacturer Essex Industries. This family-owned and operated business has been running for over 71 years! Its defense manufacturing is mission-critical to our national security, and I am happy to report that the National Defense Authorization Act the President signed last week will continue to provide funding to increase our military preparedness. I also stopped by ASPEQ Heating Group, another local manufacturer that has benefited tremendously from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. During my visit, they shared how their employees and business are better off now with tax reform. Now more than ever, small businesses are optimistic about growth and reinvesting in their companies through employee benefits and hiring.  At Burns & McDonnell, a 100% employee-owned architecture and engineering firm, I heard firsthand how they are able to provide more and better benefits to workers through their retirement contribution plan. I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 2092, the Promotion and Expansion of Private Employee Ownership Act, which will incentivize the creation of additional employee-owned businesses and give workers more opportunities to retire with increased savings. 
￼
￼
￼
Keeping our community safe is vitally important, and I am forever grateful for our first responders, police officers, and firefighters who work so hard to protect our friends, neighbors, and loved ones. I dropped by the Metro West Fire Protection District to hear about the great work Metro West’s Opioid Task Force is doing to combat the opioid epidemic striking the region. Congratulations to Mike Thiemann, the new Division Chief of External Affairs and Emergency Management! I have every confidence that he will continue to be an asset to Metro West’s team for years to come.  Nurses for Newborns has also done amazing work protecting our community’s children. During my visit, I saw firsthand what they are doing to end infant mortality and support new parents with their expert nursing care and host of wraparound services. Many infant deaths are preventable; Nurses for Newborns’ invaluable resources are saving lives each day. 
￼
￼
￼
As an elected official, I believe that connecting with local government officials and businessmen and women is crucial to representing Missouri’s 2nd District in the best way possible. Last week, I enjoyed discussing the exciting things happening in Wildwood with Mayor Jim Bowlin and meeting some of the fantastic members of the Chesterfield Chamber of Commerce at their monthly meeting. I also provided a congressional update at the West County Chamber of Commerce’s quarterly government affairs meeting, where numerous state representatives, city officials, police and fire department representatives, and school superintendents gathered to provide updates to each other. We must continue to support the great work each branch does to grow and promote our community. 
￼
￼
￼
In case you missed it, earlier this month I announced legislation with Senator Marco Rubio which would create a much-needed option for paid family leave. For more information on how our proposals will not only give parents more choices but may even help make America's bankrupt entitlements solvent, check out the latest from The Federalist.

Honoring the Life & Legacy of Dominican-American Tuskegee Airman Esteban Hotesse

Thursday, August 23rd starting at 6:30 p.m., Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) will host a reception in collaboration with the City College of New York, to posthumously award the Congressional Gold Medal to Second Lieutenant Esteban Hotesse for his service as a member of the Tuskegee Airmen.

Esteban Hotesse was born on February 11, 1919 in Moca, Dominican Republic. He came to the U.S. at the age of 4 with his mother, Clara Pacheco, and sister, Irma Hotesse. During World War II, Hotesse became a member of the Tuskegee Airmen, the first all-black group of military pilots in the U.S. Armed Forces. He attained the rank of Second Lieutenant in the 619th Bombardment Squadron of the 477th Bombardment Group. 

Esteban Hotesse was among 101 Tuskegee Airmen officers arrested on April 11, 1945 for refusing to obey the Jim Crow system. His arrest took place after a series of incidents involving black officers challenging de facto segregation by entering clubs reserved for white officers only and demanding service at the Freeman Army Airfield, a U.S. Army Air Forces base near Seymour, Indiana. In an attempt to enforce segregation, the base’s white commanding officer, Col. Robert B. Selway, issued an order that classified all black officers as “trainees,” which barred them from entering any facilities for white officers and directed all officers to sign a statement verifying that they read, understood, and accepted the order. Hotesse, along with another 100 officers, were arrested for refusing to sign the statement. 

These 101 soldiers acted courageously, against racial segregation in the military, prompting President Harry S. Truman, in 1948, to legally desegregate the armed forces. Many historians see the Tuskegee's actions as a prelude to the historic Montgomery Bus Boycott, occurring 9 years later, championed by Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, a pivotal mark for the Civil Rights Movement.

This event is open to the public and members of the press.

Esteban Hotesse nació el 11 de febrero de 1919 en Moca, República Dominicana. Llegó a los Estados Unidos a la edad de 4 años con su madre, Clara Pacheco, y su hermana, Irma Hotesse. Durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, Hotesse se convirtió en miembro de los Aviadores de Tuskegee, el primer grupo de pilotos militares negros en las Fuerzas Armadas de los EE.UU. Obtuvo el rango de segundo teniente en el 619 ° Escuadrón de Bombardeo del 477 ° Grupo de Bombardeo.

Esteban Hotesse estuvo entre los 101 oficiales de los Aviadores de Tuskegee arrestados el 11 de abril de 1945 por negarse a obedecer el sistema Jim Crow. Su arresto tuvo lugar luego de una serie de incidentes en los que oficiales negros desafiaron la segregación de facto ingresando en clubes reservados solo para oficiales blancos y demandando servicio en el Freeman Army Airfield, una base de las Fuerzas Aéreas del Ejército de EE.UU. cerca de Seymour, Indiana. En un intento por imponer la segregación, el comandante blanco de la base, el coronel Robert B. Selway, emitió una orden que clasificaba a todos los oficiales negros como ""aprendices"", lo que les impedía ingresar a las instalaciones para oficiales blancos y ordenaba a todos los oficiales firmar una declaración que verificaba que leyeron, comprendieron y aceptaron el pedido. Hotesse, junto con otros 100 oficiales, fueron arrestados por negarse a firmar la declaración.

Estos 101 soldados actuaron valientemente, en contra de la segregación racial en el ejército, lo que llevó al presidente Harry S. Truman, en 1948, a eliminar de manera legal la segregación de las fuerzas armadas. Muchos historiadores ven las acciones de Tuskegee como un preludio del histórico boicot al autobús de Montgomery, que se produjo nueve años más tarde, defendido por Martin Luther King Jr. y Rosa Parks, un hecho fundamental para el Movimiento por los Derechos Civiles.

Este evento está abierto al público y la prensa.

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 8.20.18
Monday, August 20, 2018 –                                 
The Farm Bill: Supporting Farming for Food and Industry
I recently enjoyed a stop at the Virginia State Peach Festival, held in Stuart on August 16. For 31 years, the festival has been celebrating peaches and all their uses, from eating them on their own to enjoying them in a homemade cobbler.
Celebrating peaches is fun, but a lot of work goes into getting them to our tables, our lunchboxes, or even our festivals based around them. Producing all 6,500 tons of Virginia peaches (as reported in the last completed Census of Agriculture) requires selecting the right peaches for the local climate and soil, planting the trees every few years, tending them, picking them, and shipping them. 
A farmer can make all the correct decisions and still not yield a valuable crop. The weather might turn bad, or market forces in other parts of the world might diminish the worth of the produce. Hard work goes into farming, but there are many factors beyond a farmer’s control that could determine his or her success or failure.
That’s why the farm bill is so important. Its policies support farmers so they can grow food for our country and the whole world.
Congress reauthorizes the farm bill roughly every five years. The House and Senate have each passed versions of the farm bill this year, and it is now in conference committee to work out the differences between them. It is one of the most important priorities facing Congress this year.
One of its objectives is to reauthorize crop insurance, which protects farmers against bad harvests while minimizing the risk to taxpayers. The House version of the 2018 farm bill largely maintains the crop insurance program, so farmers have stable federal policies. Corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton make up the majority of covered crops, but the specific crops eligible for insurance vary by county; in 2016, for example, 926 acres of peaches in Virginia were covered.
The farm bill also strengthens policies to promote trade in farm products. The United States exports $140 billion in agriculture annually. Maintaining and strengthening ties to foreign markets will make sure farmers can sell their products across the globe.
The farm bill offers stability for the crops grown in Virginia. Pending the product of the conference committee, it may also provide new opportunity for a crop once common in Virginia but now banned from growing for commercial use: industrial hemp.
Hemp as a crop for industrial and manufacturing purposes has a lengthy history in Virginia. Among its growers in our past were Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, who even considered for a time replacing tobacco with hemp as a cash crop. It was the cash crop in some parts of Southwest Virginia at the time because the climate was too wet for growing tobacco. Henry Clay, the statesman born in Virginia who represented Kentucky in the House and Senate, championed American-grown hemp as part of the manufacturing base in the young United States.
During their time, hemp was most useful in making rope, but its applicability for industry in our time is much broader, from rope to shirts to components of automobiles. However, the federal ban on marijuana also ensnared industrial hemp, even though hemp cultivated for industrial use lacks the potency of marijuana, so hemp has been prohibited in the United States for decades.
It’s time for this illogical and unproductive ban to end. I am an original cosponsor of a bill to exclude industrial hemp from the ban on marijuana. The Senate version of the farm bill legalizes industrial hemp production, and I hope the final farm bill produced by the conference committee keeps this provision.
As you might imagine, the farm bill includes a vast array of provisions. I’ve previously written about reforms to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and there are numerous other pieces beside SNAP and the ones discussed above. 
My goal in the farm bill is to support Ninth District farmers. The Ninth District of Virginia boasts a strong agricultural industry, but whether one farms or enjoys the products of farming, agriculture is important to all of us. That’s why we celebrate at events such as the Virginia Peach Festival.

It's Time to Slow Down the Race and Limit the Congressional Campaign Season
￼  Click on the screen above to hear me talk about the importance of limiting the Congressional campaign season.  
Dear Friend,  
Our Restore Democracy revolution calls for limiting the Congressional campaign season to 60 days before a primary or a general election – and prohibiting Members of Congress or their challengers from personally asking for money on days when Congress is in session.  
There’s nothing magical about the 60 day limit, but 365 days is terribly wrong. The simple fact is that non-stop, 365-day a year congressional campaigns tune out voters, tire out candidates, and turn Members of Congress into mid-level telemarketers who spend far more time dialing for dollars than governing.  
Moreover, non-stop campaigning has done nothing to boost voter participation. According to the highly respected Pew Research organization, the U.S. has ranked an embarrassing 31st among 34 developed nations in voter turnout over the past few election cycles. 
In fact, limiting the campaign season is a tried and true fix that developed nations all around the world have employed to boost voter interest in elections and put a stop to 24/7 fundraising by the candidates. For example, Canada’s 2015 elections, the longest in recent history, lasted just 11 weeks. And as the Washington Post reported at the time, even that was too long for many Canadians: 
When Canadians look south to our system, it seems confusing. After all, our campaigns last longer than most Canadian governments do. “Strange is not the right word — well, maybe strange is the right word,” said Peter Mansbridge, the chief correspondent for CBC News. “They don’t get how you can be so consumed for so long in the political process of electing instead of the process of governing.” 
The Restore Democracy Revolution 
By themselves, any of the measures in our Restore Democracy legislation would constitute a major boost for our democratic process. Taken together, they are nothing short of revolutionary in scope.
The foundation lies overturning the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision that has allowed powerful special interests to pour tens of billions of dollars in secret “dark” money into our campaigns and elections. Our legislation would also put Congress on record supporting small donor-public campaign financing. Moreover, we are calling for full disclosure of all campaign contributions, establishment of national online voter registration and a halt to all voter suppression. 
We also call for a return to Congress’s traditional process of Regular Order. Under Regular Order, we seek common ground and find bipartisan solutions by fully considering every bill and amendment under an open rule – and affording each one an up or down vote. That’s how Congress fixed things, solved problems and got things done for more than 200 years. 
We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email. 
Sincerely,  ￼ 

President's New Ocean Policy Could Open the Door to Corporate Exploitation  
￼  Eight years ago today, on August 20, 2018, a massive natural gas explosion at the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform caused 134 million gallons of oil to spill into the Gulf of Mexico, causing terrible destruction and harm to water and wildlife, including thousands of migrating Minnesota loons. The President’s new Ocean Policy appears to open the door to corporate exploitation that could lead to more disasters.  
It looks like our great oceans could be the next targets as the President and GOP leaders continue working to make it easier for wealthy corporations and big polluters to exploit the land, air and water so they can become even richer and more profitable.   Just eight years after President Obama’s executive order established America’s first Ocean Policy in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon explosion that poured 134 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, the current President has issued another order to weaken the measure.   The differences between the two Ocean Policies are clear and stark.    The Obama Ocean Policy recognized the role of climate change and arctic melting in rising ocean levels, specifically cited the Deepwater Horizon disaster, and focused on environmental stewardship and federal leadership with the states in advancing ways to better protect waters and coastlines.   But under the guise of “streamlining,” the current Administration’s ocean policy makes no mention of Deepwater or climate change, and puts individual states in charge of partnering with the federal government on marine decision-making. The result is likely to be less coordination and cooperation between state and federal governments and other stakeholders, and more opportunities for corporate exploitation.  The President’s weakened Ocean Policy comes on the heels of the Administration’s plan to open nearly all of the U.S. coastline to offshore oil and gas drilling, and to possibly open three marine monuments – Pacific Remote Islands, Rose Atoll, and the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts – to commercial fishing.   

""Revoke My Security Clearance Too,"" Says Commander Who Staged Raid that Killed Osama Bin Laden 
￼  Then President Obama congratulates Navy admiral William McRaven after he (McRaven) led the successful mission to kill Osama bin Laden in 2011.   
The current President’s decision to revoke former CIA director John Brennan’s security clearance in retaliation for criticizing his performance in the White House was remarkably petty, uncalled for, and damaging to our national security. Former CIA directors retain their security clearance so they can continue to view classified information and advise the current administration on national security matters when asked.   Following the announcement of the President’s action against former Director Brennan, retired Navy Admiral William McRaven, who oversaw the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden in 2011, wrote this open letter for the Washington Post.  
Revoke my security clearance, too, Mr. President
By William H. McRaven  August 16 at 2:44 PM  William H. McRaven, a retired Navy admiral, was commander of the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command from 2011 to 2014. He oversaw the 2011 Navy SEAL raid in Pakistan that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden.  Dear Mr. President:  Former CIA director John Brennan, whose security clearance you revoked on Wednesday, is one of the finest public servants I have ever known. Few Americans have done more to protect this country than John. He is a man of unparalleled integrity, whose honesty and character have never been in question, except by those who don’t know him.  Therefore, I would consider it an honor if you would revoke my security clearance as well, so I can add my name to the list of men and women who have spoken up against your presidency.  Like most Americans, I had hoped that when you became president, you would rise to the occasion and become the leader this great nation needs. 
A good leader tries to embody the best qualities of his or her organization. A good leader sets the example for others to follow. A good leader always puts the welfare of others before himself or herself.  Your leadership, however, has shown little of these qualities. Through your actions, you have embarrassed us in the eyes of our children, humiliated us on the world stage and, worst of all, divided us as a nation.  If you think for a moment that your McCarthy-era tactics will suppress the voices of criticism, you are sadly mistaken. The criticism will continue until you become the leader we prayed you would be. 

Time for Senate GOP Leaders Get to Work on the People's Business
￼  Cartoonist Dave Granlund’s got this right.  
The notoriously under-achieving Republican-led U.S. House is starting to look like gangbusters compared to a Republican-led U.S. Senate that’s hardly showing up for work at all these days.   With the Farm Bill, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill, and appropriations bills necessary to keep the government running all stalled in one way or another, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell announced earlier this summer that the traditional August recess would be cancelled in favor of some hard work.    But as Capitol Hill’s Roll Call newspaper reported last week, up until August 16th, the Senate had actually been in session for only three days during the month, conducting just 10 roll call votes. They convened at noon last Wednesday, and adjourned around 4:30 on Thursday. That’s quite a work week.   To be clear, Republicans are in charge of both the Senate and the House. They set the schedule and make the rules. Now it’s time for them to get serious about getting things done for the American people. When you go to Washington, you should go to work – five days a week like everyone else. 

Our Week in Bemidji 
￼  Red Lake Indian Health Service Hospital, Cass Lake Indian Health Service Hospital, and Sanford Bemidji hosted a powwow to honor healthcare workers in the region. In this photo, you can see color guards from the Red Lake Band of Ojibwe, the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, the White Earth Nation, and the Bemidji VFW presenting the colors. Congressional Field Representative Tiffany Stenglein attended the event on my behalf.
Our Week in Marine Lake  
￼  Retired Machinist Union group held a picnic at the Veterans Camp on Big Marine Lake last week. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen attended the picnic on my behalf and snapped this photo of some of the attendees. 
Our Week in Brainerd 
￼  The Franklin Arts Center recently held an open house to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its opening. The Center was converted from a junior high school to provide federally-supported affordable housing and retail/work space for local artists. In this photo, asset Manager Erika Dani encourages the group to sing a round of “Happy Birthday” before the cake is cut. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tiffany Stenglein attend the event. 
￼  The Brainerd History Group was able to recover several railings from 1898 Laurel Street Bridge that were being used as farm fencing. As part of Brainerd History Week, one railing was installed, with a historical marker, on the north side of the eastern edge of the current bridge. In this picture, local officials recreated a photo from the original bridge dedication. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tiffany Stenglein snapped this photo of locals posing with the historic railings. 

Finally...
August 20, 1866 - Unions Begin Long Battle for the  Eight-Hour Workday
￼  This 1950’s era poster reminded workers of how America’s unions had improved their lives.  
Virtually every benefit today’s workers enjoy – the eight-hour day, the five-day workweek, health and safety regulations, pensions, paid overtime, and paid time off just to name a few – were delivered on the broad shoulders of America’s great unions. In fact, organized Labor’s long battle to establish an eight-hour workday as the standard for America’s workers began exactly 152 years ago today when the National Labor Union – an alliance of workers, farmers and reformers – called on Congress to order an eight-hour workday.  Despite constant lobbying, organizing and hard work, the breakthrough didn’t come until 1933, when Congress passed the National Industrial Recovery Act, an emergency measure initiated by President Franklin Roosevelt in response to the Great Depression. The Act provided for the establishment of maximum working hours, a minimum wage and the right to collective bargaining. But as the Library of Congress notes, it was not until the 1950’s that most workers actually gained the eight-hour day, as more Americans than ever were able to join and participate in unions.

Learning from the Past to Keep Us Safe 
￼

On 9/11, terrorists counted on being able to rush and breach the cockpit knowing that the doors would be opened early in the flight. And they did. And today, nearly seventeen years later, the flight deck remains vulnerable when that cockpit has to open.

That’s why, at the 9/11 Memorial at the Midland Park Fire Department, I stood with Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican from Pennsylvania, to call on Congress to pass HR 911, the Saracini Aviation Safety Act. This legislation mandates inexpensive, lightweight wire-mesh gates to be installed between the passenger cabin and the cockpit door that would block access to the flight deck whenever the cockpit door is opened during flight.

The legislation is named in honor of pilot Captain Victor J. Saracini, who was killed when terrorists hijacked United Flight 175 on September 11, 2001. Captain Saracini’s widow, Ellen, has been a leading advocate on the issue since her husband’s death. Ellen stood with me and Brian in Midland Park to honor the legacy of her husband and all those lost on that fateful day by making sure a tragedy like 9/11 never happens again.

Fixing Our Crumbling Roads, Bridges, Tunnels, and Transit 
Good infrastructure is at the core of our economy’s success. Nowhere is that more true than in New Jersey, where we are second in the nation, percentage-wise, of commuters who rely on public transit.

Yet, over the last year, NJ Transit has had more train breakdowns than any other commuter railroad in America. We’ve seen projects like the critical Gateway Project suffer bureaucratic barriers, a lack of investment, or delays. If the Hudson River tunnels fail in the next few years and have to come offline, the U.S. economy would lose $100 million per day.

Thank you to Senator Paul Sarlo, Assemblymembers Chris Tully and Lisa Swain, Joseph M. Sanzari Inc. President & CEO Joe Sanzari, Bergen County BCTC President Rick Sabato, Bergen County CLC President Mike Schneider, and leaders from the Operating Engineers, Utility and Transportation Contractors, United Brotherhood of Carpenters, IBEW, United Association of Pipefitters, Regional Plan Association, Coach USA, Tilcon, New Prince Concrete Construction, HC Constructors Inc., and more for joining me at the IBEW Local 164 Hall in Paramus to discuss working together to invest in our state.

Calling on the EPA to Combat a Public Health Threat 
The dumping of waste in New Jersey is a serious environmental threat and a risk to public health.

I joined Vernon Township Mayor Harry Shortway to assess the waste dumping situation in Vernon firsthand, and to call on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to step in to help our local officials combat the public health threat. We must act now, before anything leaches into our water supply or causes lasting environmental damage.

Working Together to “Break the Gridlock” 
North Jersey residents have seen their interests sidelined too many times by a system that empowers the voices of a few extremists over those looking to find solutions and move the ball forward.

Members of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus—made up of 24 Democrats and 24 Republicans in the House—have been working for nearly two years to develop a package of rules changes for the House that will reward openness and transparency, encourage working across the aisle, and empower lawmakers to reach real solutions by holding meaningful debate.

Our “Break the Gridlock” reforms will pave the way towards real progress on critical issues such as the Gateway Project, healthcare, and immigration reform.

Coming Together to Combat the Opioid Crisis 
Our nation has been ravaged by the growing opioid abuse epidemic, and New Jersey is no exception. Already this year, more than 1,600 people have died of drug overdoses—an average of more than eight New Jersey residents per day.

Fortunately, we are making progress, thanks in part to groups like the Sussex County Community Law Enforcement Addiction Recovery (C.L.E.A.R.) program, which just celebrated its second anniversary of helping those struggling with addiction seek help without fear of prosecution. 

Thank you to Congressman Fitzpatrick and the Sussex County doctors, first responders, religious leaders, community leaders, and local elected officials who joined me at Newton Medical Center to share best practices and discuss solutions. We live in the greatest country in the world, and I know that, by coming together, we can solve this crisis.

Honoring the 2018 “Senior of the Year”
I was proud to honor veteran and Sussex County resident Roy McQueen as the 2018 “Senior of the Year” at this year’s Sussex County State Fair. 

Roy is a perfect representation of what makes Sussex County great. As a veteran and as a civilian, he has dedicated himself to his family, his community, and his country. After serving our country in the U.S. Army and then working tirelessly in his career as a civil servant, Roy now volunteers with Meals on Wheels, helps drive the local Girl Scouts to trips and meetings, and visits his fellow veterans at the local hospital. Thank you, Roy, for all you do.

Dear Friends,

I believe that all Arkansans should be afforded the chance to pursue happiness and prosper regardless of their environment or background.

When Arkansans are given the opportunity to take advantage of the good-paying job opportunities that are increasingly available, they can provide for themselves, their families, and help build our communities. As you know, I use my Community Empowerment Initiative (CEI) and my CEI Blog to promote aspiration and engage solutions that make our communities stronger. That’s why, this month, I’m recognizing Goodwill Industries of Arkansas.

Goodwill does so much more than sell donated clothing and household items. When you donate to or shop at Goodwill, you help fund their mission of changing lives through education, training, and employment. In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, Goodwill placed 6,375 people into employment in Arkansas with an average wage of $10.89. Goodwill provided additional services to 19,247 Arkansans during that same time. All Arkansans, regardless of income, education, or criminal background can receive free assistance with their job search, resume building, and interview skill development at the Goodwill Career Training Center in Little Rock. 

When U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Dr. Ben Carson came to central Arkansas in May of this year, we visited Goodwill’s training facilities. We sat down with Goodwill’s exceptional leadership and took a tour, seeing their operations firsthand.

￼
Pictured: Brian Itzkowitz, President and Chief Executive Officer of Goodwill Industries of Arkansas, showing Secretary Carson and me Goodwill’s training facility where we met with students at their Excel Center. 

We saw the Excel Center at Goodwill, which is the first adult high school in Arkansas. The tuition-free school provides students aged 19 and older with a second chance to earn a high school diploma, and is geared toward working adults. In particular, flexible and accelerated class schedules, free drop-in childcare, and transportation assistance are available to each student. Life coaches are assigned to every student to ensure that any barriers to success can be overcome. Support from resources like life coaches are invaluable as they played an essential role in my growth as a student. 

Another impressive aspect of Goodwill is their prison reentry program. Individuals participating in the Goodwill program have a recidivism rate of less than 10 percent compared to the national rate of around 50 percent. This program assists individuals with a history of criminal convictions and incarceration as they transition into their communities and find a better quality of life. This enables people to overcome barriers to successful employment through training and education. Goodwill delivers a superior level of expertise in recruiting, screening, and preparing jobseekers, and as a result, employers receive the most qualified and capable candidates. 

It’s obvious through the results we’ve seen that Goodwill is more than your neighborhood retail store and a place to drop off donations. This is an organization that cares deeply about giving back and empowering communities, and one that cares about providing Arkansans an opportunity to succeed, regardless of their pasts and circumstances. That’s why I’m so proud to recognize them this month. At Goodwill the motto is “Donate, Shop, and Change a Life!” When organizations like Goodwill flourish in our state, Arkansans and our communities are better off.

Check them out at goodwillar.org.

Sincerely,
￼ 
Representative French Hill

Wicker Traces Success Story of ‘JROTC Act’
Legislation Earns Widespread Support in Congress
Sometimes a conversation at church can spark an idea for a law.  That happened in early May, when my longtime friend Leland Speed told me about the success of the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps, commonly known as JROTC, in the Jackson Public School system. 
As Leland explained, more than 90 percent of this year’s graduating seniors who participated in a JROTC program within the Jackson Public School system have been accepted into an institution of higher learning.  More than $7.5 million in scholarships have been awarded to these JROTC graduates.
JROTC’s Record of Positive Outcomes
I would come to find out that the success of the seven Jackson public schools with JROTC units is not an outlier.  According to a RAND Corporation study, participating in JROTC is likely to improve a student’s grade point average and test scores.  Cadets are more likely not to drop out of school but to graduate and go to college.  In the process, JROTC instills valuable leadership skills and community service, teaching high school students about personal responsibility and civic engagement. 
These findings match my own experience as an ROTC Cadet in college, and the record of success of many JROTC graduates.  In fact, two current members of the President’s cabinet, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, both participated in JROTC. 
But too often these programs are out of reach where they are most needed.  Hundreds of high schools across the country are on a waitlist to host a JROTC unit.
Beginning of ‘JROTC Act’
The more I learned about the success of JROTC programs, I better understood that more students would benefit from these programs in their schools.  Earlier this year, I introduced the “JROTC Opportunities for Transformational Change Act,” or “JROTC Act,” in the U.S. Senate.  The bill set out to authorize funding for 100 additional JROTC units and to make reforms that would help schools in rural and underserved areas participate. 
As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I also offered my “JROTC Act” as an amendment to the annual defense authorization bill.  It was adopted into the full bill by the committee and soon passed by the entire Senate.  Last month, the “JROTC Act” was included in the defense bill’s final conference report passed by both the House and the Senate.  President Trump signed the bill into law this week. 
Senate Committee Grants Additional Funding
Every year, there are two pieces to the puzzle when it comes to defense spending.  An annual defense authorization bill approves funding levels for our military, and then the defense appropriations bill actually puts the money toward the priorities that the authorization bill has identified. 
I am pleased to report that the defense funding bill approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee supports my “JROTC Act” by increasing our investment in JROTC.  This bill should come to the Senate floor for a vote soon. 
Our state can support more JROTC units, and I hope this legislation enables that for the communities in Mississippi that could benefit the most from these programs.  Not every bill idea emerges from a conversation at church, but the “JROTC Act” is an encouraging example of how policy solutions can be driven by local success stories.

High school students get hands-on learning at STEM Camp  
￼
 It was fun to join students from around Southwest Washington at W.F. West High School’s STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) camp in Chehalis earlier this month. There was nothing like this camp when I was in high school! What a great opportunity for local high schoolers to be exposed to college-level learning early on.
￼
And it was a treat to have UW Medicine as the special guest and talk about regenerative medicine and especially, its potential to regrow hearts. It was an incredible opportunity for all of us!
Celebrating new jobs, growth at Port of Vancouver
￼ 
It was an honor to join Port of Vancouver’s celebration in completing the West Vancouver Freight Access project on July 31. I was pleased to have helped advocate for federal funding to help the Port complete this project that will bring new jobs and expanded economic activity to our region. 

￼
At the event, I was pleased to hear Governor Inslee publicly oppose Oregon's scheme of tolling at the state line and say he'll join me in defending Southwest Washington residents from any plan that disproportionately targets them without providing any benefit.
Third Herrera Beutler-hosted grants seminar a success

Mr. Murilo Juchem of Vancouver reached out to our office after several failed attempts to contact the Department of State (DOS). Mr. Juchem, his wife and his son were all waiting to hear back about their change of status request.

After we reached out to DOS, Mr. Juchem and his family received word that all three change of status requests were approved.

Low-income housing in Clark County, and how Congress can help 

￼
With the homeless population surging in Clark County, it’s so great to see organizations and folks caring for the vulnerable members of our community. I had the privilege last week of visiting two brand-new facilities in Vancouver specifically built to house those who don’t have a home and are struggling with a behavioral or mental health disorder.

￼
Congress has an important role to play in supporting our communities, and I was pleased to recently support a funding increase for Low-Income Housing Tax Credits as we work to see more folks achieve independent living. Thank you to the good work of Vancouver Housing Authority and their partners.

Bipartisan Demand for 9/11 Bill
￼ 
This week, Congressman Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) joined Ellen Saracini and I at the Garden of Reflection 9/11 Memorial with our local first responders. We were honoring the lives lost on September 11th. Including the late Victor Saracini, Captain of United Flight 175. 
On 9/11, terrorists counted on being able to rush and breach the cockpit knowing that the doors would be opened early in the flight. And they did. And today, the flight deck remains vulnerable when that cockpit has to open. 
Last year, Congressman Gottheimer and I re-introduced a bipartisan bill, H.R. 911, the Saracini Aviation Safety Act, that would mandate the installation of secondary flight deck barriers on commercial airplanes to prevent would-be hijackers from charging the cockpits on our flights like they did on 9/11. 
Despite overwhelming support, Congress has not acted on H.R.991 As members of the Problem Solvers, Josh and I want to change the way Congress operates. We want to “Break the Gridlock.”

Bipartisan Business Visit in Warminster

Right now in the United States, there are 6.5 million unfilled jobs because employers simply cannot find workers with the necessary skills and training for the job, even as millions of American seek careers that will help secure their families a place in the middle class. 
Congressman Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) and I recently toured Prime Sheet Metal in Warminster, PA to discuss the current skills gap and workforce development initiatives with local labor leaders. In July, the bipartisan Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act was signed into law.

A Strong Defense, a Stronger America
 

This week, President Trump traveled to Fort Drum, an Army base in New York, to sign the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2019 fiscal year into law. This is the earliest passed NDAA in 41 years, and will invest in a much stronger military.   Providing for the common defense of this nation is our number one responsibility in Congress.  We upheld our responsibility when we passed the NDAA in both the House and the Senate, and today President Trump upheld his promise to keep America safe by signing it into law.  
This year's NDAA included the largest pay raise for troops in nine years -  much deserved. Additionally, it expands the size and strength of our troops by increasing the number of uniformed personnel for the Army, Navy, Navy Reserves, Air Force Reserves and the Air National Guard.  It also increases funding for training operations while working to repair vital military equipment.  Our men and women in uniform are the best in the world at what they do,  and we owe it to them to ensure they have the tools and resources they need to get the job done.  
￼

3, 2, 1, blast off! 
It was my pleasure to welcome NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine to Stennis Space Center for the RS-25 rocket engine test this week. We were able to see the 5th series of test for the RS-25 that supports NASA's Space Launch System Program. With the Trump Administration's renewed focus on space exploration, Stennis plays a vital role in the future of our country's space capabilities. After all, you can’t get to space without going through Mississippi! I look forward to continuing to work with my former colleague, Administrator Bridenstine as we continue working to ensure that we once again launch American astronauts on American Rockets from American soil!

Last weekend, my office hosted a VA Claims Clinic and Information Day in Long Beach. I wanted to extend my sincerest thanks to the Director of the Long Beach Parks and Recreation Department, Robert Paul Jr., for allowing us to use the senior activity center to host the veterans, vendors, and other attendees. I'd also like to thank the Long Beach Mayor George Bass and the Long Beach Police Chief William Seal for their help in orchestrating such a successful day. 

MAHRO
This week, it was my honor to serve as the keynote speaker at the Mississippi Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials Annual Conference. As a former CFO and Deputy Executive Director for a Small Housing Authority, I have been able to translate my experience in public housing and have personally introduced legislation that will provide regulatory relief to our small public housing authorities across the United States. I'd like to thank everyone at MAHRO for allowing me to join you again this year!

Greetings,
This week, President Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2019 into law, which includes over 30 provisions benefitting Texas and America’s national security interests at home and abroad. During my statewide 'Texas Defends America' tour, I had the opportunity to visit our brave servicemen and women at some of Texas’ top military installations, and hear firsthand both the challenges and achievements of Texas’ military communities. There is no better way to lead our country during tumultuous times than with peace through strength, and ensuring our military is properly equipped and funded is a crucial component of that endeavor. Having the NDAA signed into law demonstrates the devotion that unified Republican government has given to rebuilding our military and providing for our national security. In addition, this bill fortifies Texas’ position as a pillar of America’s defense, strategic capabilities and deterrence.
During my tour of Texas military bases, I had the pleasure of visiting Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, where I received an update on the B-1 bomber force, C-130J airlift operations, and preparations for the B-21 Raider, a long-range strike bomber. Back in May, I was pleased when the Air Force named Dyess as an official candidate to host the B-21. As a testament to the incredible work our men in women in uniform accomplish there and in Abilene, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and I penned a letter to Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson urging the Air Force to move and select Dyess as the principal base for the new B-21 Raider. This aircraft projects American strength and deters aggression around the globe, and I look forward to seeing it call Dyess home.
Hurricane Harvey wreaked unparalleled havoc on the Texas Gulf Coast. But in the face of destruction, Texans stood united to help their fellow Texans, including students and schools who faced devastation and disruption. Many schools opened their doors to displaced students out of their district, to help them continue with their academic studies. This week, the Department of Education announced $174.2 million in federal funds to Texas as part of the Temporary Emergency Impact Aid for Displaced Students. These funds will directly help cover the costs of educating students who were displaced as a result of Hurricane Harvey. I am grateful for the leadership of Secretary DeVos in providing federal support to our students and schools in their time of need, and for those Texas schools that stepped up to the plate for our children in the aftermath of Harvey.
As we continue to rebuild from the unprecedented devastation from Hurricane Harvey, we must also take all steps necessary to prepare for the hurricane season ahead. For those seeking information or assistance during the recovery and rebuilding process, please do not hesitate to contact my office or use the federal and state resources listed here. For those seeking preparedness information and resources, please refer to the federal and state resources listed here.

Dear Friend,
Lots happening in AugustI joined Sen. Amy Klobuchar at a forum hosted by the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce on efforts to combat human sex trafficking. The forum was part of the Chamber’s Women in Business initiative, which engages female business owners and connects them with policy makers.
I also addressed different groups including the Sons of Norway, the Minnesota Association of CPAs, and the Minneapolis Business Partnership. The President of the National Brewers Association came to Minnesota and joined me for a tour at Town Hall Brewery to hear about the benefits realized by the new law I wrote that is helping craft brewers grow and expand. I spent National Night Out in Wayzata and Maple Grove, and visited several small businesses, as well as Minnesota Oncology for perspectives on health care.
Have a great week and please let me know whenever I can be of assistance to you or your family. Join the conversation online by visiting my website, Facebook page, Twitter, and Instagram, and please watch the latest Erik's Correspondence Corner video.

Making Medications More Affordable 
Rising drug costs are a problem for Minnesota families. One of the things that make medications more expensive than they should be are restrictions that prohibit pharmacists from informing patients when it would actually be cheaper to pay for their medications out-of-pocket, rather than through their insurance. Called ""gag clauses"", this often mean families end up paying more for their medications.
It's why I've authored bipartisan legislation with Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) that cracks down on these ""gag clauses"". The end result will be that Minnesota families will be better-informed when it comes to making decisions about how they pay for their medications. Learn more about my bill here.
 
Youth Unemployment Hits 52-Year Low
More good economic news in last week: The unemployment rate among young Americans fell to its lowest level in more than 50 years this summer. This is important because low unemployment among young people shows that in a tight labor market more opportunities are opening to groups that historically have struggled to find jobs.
It's just the latest indicator of our booming economy, which I highlighted in last week's newsletter.
 
Aiding America's Veterans
The Department of Veterans Affairs was in dire straits just a few years ago. Wait times were skyrocketing, and too many of America's veterans couldn't get the medical care they earned through their service to our nation.
But our veterans are better off now, after bipartisan support to pass a series of measures that overhaul the VA and make it easier for vets to get the care they need.
For example: the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act now makes it easier to terminate or suspend VA employees for misconduct or poor performance.
The VA MISSION Act consolidates a number of important VA community care programs and helps veterans access private care if they're not able to get an appointment with a VA clinic. And, the Forever GI Bill helps eligible veterans access their education benefits throughout their lives, instead of just the current 15 year period.
The end result of all of these measures is better care and better benefits for our nation's veterans.

International Flag Ceremony at Fort Leavenworth:
This week, I had the pleasure of joining General Arter at Ft. Leavenworth for the Command and General Staff Officers' Course Class of 2019 International Flag Ceremony, which marks the official beginning of the 2019 Academic Year. The ceremony featured a posting of the national colors of 87 nations that make up this year's International Military Student class. With increasingly uncertain and complex environments around the world, forging strong relationships with our international partners is vital and the folks at Ft. Leavenworth play a crucial role in the success of international partnerships.

Looking Forward to My Annual Farm Tour:
Next week is my annual Farm Tour to visit with producers and discuss agriculture in Eastern Kansas. I always look forward to visiting these family farm operations and hearing about the issues impacting their businesses and livelihoods. From expanding trade opportunities to lessening burdensome regulations, the voices of rural America and farm country must be heard at the federal level and it has been my honor over the years to help carry these voices in Congress.

From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:
Good Afternoon,
For more than 70 years, baseball has been a staple for Williamsport. On Thursday, players from around the world converged on the city to compete in the Little League World Series.
￼
Williamsport on the World Stage 
The Little League World Series is more than just baseball; it brings our community together, highlights the best of our youth, and promotes lifelong friendships. As a resident of Williamsport, I am honored to be part of such a rich history of competition and sportsmanship. I am constantly impressed by the caliber of athletes that play at Howard J. Lamade Stadium. None have shown more dedication than our very own Lady Tigers from Tunkhannock and Clinton County’s Keystone Little League. Though their bid for the championship has come to an end, I am proud of the commitment these players have shown to their teammates and the sport they love. Congratulations, Tigers and Clinton County, on a fantastic performance and a memorable postseason!
Farming Families Attend Ag Progress Days
I had the pleasure of attending Ag Progress Day’s luncheon for government and industry officials.
￼
Hosted by Penn State’s College of Agricultural Sciences, Ag Progress Days is Pennsylvania’s largest outdoor agricultural exposition. I enjoyed meeting leaders of the agricultural industry from across the state, where I got up-to-date with the latest research, management practices, and regulations in agriculture. I also had the chance to talk to several people about the work I’m doing to support dairy farmers and expand rural broadband access. Thank you for the great afternoon!
Baking at the Food Bank 
On Thursday, I had the opportunity to join Vince DiSalvo and make pizza at the Williamsport Food Bank.
￼
Though it’s been many years since my time as a baker, I was quick to get back into the swing of things. I had a great time working all morning with Vince to support an important cause. The pizzas were shared and enjoyed at Memorial Park later that afternoon.
Improving Health-Care Choice for Americans
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar recently discussed the scope of Obamacare and its effect on the United States’ individual insurance market. Under Obamacare, millions of hardworking Americans have been forced to choose between unaffordable insurance and no insurance at all. To improve health-care choice and coverage for all Americans, President Trump has reimplemented short term, limited-duration insurance for up to a year, free from most Obamacare regulations, that cost between 50 and 80 percent less. These short-term plans are ideal for small business owners, independent contractors, and students transitioning between school and employment. By allowing insurers and states to have more freedom, Americans who have been neglected by Obamacare will finally have affordable choices.
Click here to read more about Secretary Azar’s position and what the Trump administration is doing to expand health-care choices.
3rd Annual Suicide Awareness, Prevention, and Remembrance Walk
The Wayne/Pike Suicide Awareness, Prevention, and Remembrance Walk will be held on Saturday, September 29, 2018 at the Wallenpaupack Area High School, Hawley, PA. This walk aims to help fight suicide and support those who have lost someone to suicide. All donations for Wayne and Pike Counties will stay in our counties, helping to provide local suicide prevention programs and end the stigma that stops people from asking for help. By coming out to support this important event, we can show those who are suffering from depression and thoughts of suicide are not alone.
You may register and donate the day of the event or on line at: www.northeastsuicidepreventioninitiative.org click on register and enter Wayne or Pike County.

NEWS FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT
Dear Friend,

We had a busy week traveling the Second District and hearing from health care providers, business owners, law enforcement, and pro-life advocates. Please read about my week below:

Lake City Opioid Listening Session
￼ 
This week, we held our 4th Opioid Listening Session in the Second District in Lake City. I heard from law enforcement, local leaders, organizations from the health care community, faith-based organizations, and those who have fought the epidemic on the front lines - all fighting to end this epidemic and save lives. As a physician, I have witnessed firsthand the harsh realities of opioid use and understand the severity of this crisis. Congress is working diligently with President Trump to bring this crisis to an end. We are working to supply law enforcement with the proper resources to combat illegal drug distribution, in addition to funding treatment and prevention programs.
  
Supporting Businesses in North Florida
￼ 
On Wednesday, I joined the Bay County Chamber of Commerce for a round table. We discussed issues affecting the area including the Military Mission Line, Port Panama City, and the federal courthouse. I always appreciate hearing from local leaders about how we can improve the economy in the Second District.

￼ 
I then visited with an array of small business owners at SSR Restorations for a working lunch hosted by the National Federation of Independent Business. We toured the SSR Restorations shop and learned about some of the projects they are working on. During the lunch we talked about challenges that businesses face today and how Congress can help alleviate some of these challenges.

Bay County Federal Courthouse 
This week, the General Services Administration (GSA) decided to keep a federal courthouse for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida in Panama City. The current federal courthouse in Bay County is expected to close when its lease expires on December 31, 2018. GSA selected the proposal put forth by the Bay County Chamber of Commerce Task Force, which will convert the Bay County Juvenile Justice Courthouse located at 533 E. 11th Street in Panama City into a federal courthouse. This is great news for the Second District. We have been working for over a year to keep a federal courthouse serving the six counties between Pensacola and Panama City in the area. I am pleased that GSA chose a financially responsible way to serve Northwest Florida, while saving the court system money. 
Click here to learn more.
Fighting for the Unborn ￼  I was honored to join the Susan B. Anthony List this week to rally in support of Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh. We are working with President Trump to put good, honest, conservatives who reflect the will and morals of the American people and fight for the unborn on the Supreme Court. As a father of three, a grandfather of three, and as a man of faith, I believe firmly that life begins at conception. I have operated on unborn babies to save their lives – these are children – and I fight every day in Congress to protect them. These Supreme Court appointments will have effects on life in this country for decades to come, which is why I believe our senators should support Judge Kavanaugh.  Dredging Port Panama City  ￼  I met with Col. Sebastian Joly, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) Mobile District Commander, and his team to discuss dredging efforts at Port Panama City. We went over funding opportunities for the port and the current dredging status. We have been diligently working with local stakeholders and the Corps of Engineers to move this dredging project forward.  Working With Local Health Care Providers  ￼  I had a great time touring HealthSouth Emerald Coast Rehabilitation Hospital and meeting with patients, doctors, employees, and the CEO, Tony Bennett. We spoke about healthcare in Bay County and how current policies are working at the local level.   Thank you for your continued energy and enthusiasm, as reflected in your letters and Facebook posts. If you haven’t already, LIKE my Facebook page. You can also follow me on Twitter @DrNealDunnFL2. 
Thank you for the opportunity to serve you in Congress!

News from Representative Bradley Byrne
  
￼
ABOUT BRADLEY | HOW CAN I HELP | CONTACT BRADLEY | WANT TO RECEIVE MY UPDATES?
￼

Dear Lindsey, 
Good news! We officially learned on Tuesday that there are no plans to house illegal immigrants at two Navy outlying airfields in south Baldwin County. I received a letter from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Deputy Director Ronald Vitiello in response to our weeks of asking them to abandon this bad idea. Click here to read the letter from ICE. 
Housing illegal immigrants at ill-equipped airfields along the Gulf Coast was always a terrible idea, so I appreciate the confirmation that this plan is no longer being considered. We had a team effort to push back this flawed idea, and I especially want to thank Baldwin County Commissioners Chris Elliott and Tucker Dorsey and Baldwin County Sheriff Hoss Mack for their advocacy on this issue. 
While I am glad this issue is resolved, we must continue working to secure the border and eliminate the need for additional housing for illegal immigrants altogether. I remain 100% committed to working with President Trump to build a border wall, hire additional border patrol officers, and ensure our border security is as strong as possible.

Dear Friend,  
It is certainly no secret to anyone that Robins Air Force Base plays a big role in our Middle Georgia community, supporting thousands of jobs and driving $2.8 billion in economic impact each year. 
Just as the forces behind our armed forces are the integral component of the success and lethality of our military, our Department of Defense (DOD) civilians are also critical to completing our missions safely and successfully. 
The depot work completed by the Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex (WR-ALC) on the highly advanced, technical, and critical RQ-4 Global Hawk and E-8 Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) platforms is vital to our national interest, as the two perform highly specialized and in-demand missions for our Combatant Commanders in theater around the world.
The WR-ALC depot is a testament to the skilled workforce of Middle Georgia, and as we continue to service these and other fleets, such as the C-130 Hercules, it is imperative we continue to build and support the civilian workforce who maintain the missions.
This past week, Robins leadership, along with the 21st Century Partnership, announced a new initiative to hire 1,200 new employees at Robins in the next 12 months, equating to an annual economic impact of $69M and over $345M over the next five years. 
I had the opportunity to attend the launch of ""1200 in 12,"" and I am very proud of this hiring initiative. I know that the impact of these new jobs means more opportunities for Georgians and increased economic development will be felt throughout Middle Georgia and the state as a whole.
Robins is a first-class mission with a first-class workforce, and this announcement ensures we will be able to continue to provide the DOD with the civilian manpower it needs to maintain our aircraft and infrastructure for years to come. 
I look forward to seeing the progress and impact of the ""1200 in 12"" initiative and continuing to look for legislative solutions for building the workforce in Warner Robins in the coming years.

DISCUSSING THE FARM BILL WITH GA FARM BUREAU PRESIDENT GERALD LONG 
Agriculture is a key industry in Georgia, and as we continue to work through the final deliberations of the Farm Bill, I am continuing to meet with local leaders and producers to make sure we get this policy right.
This past week, I had the chance to sit down with my good friend Gerald Long, President of the Georgia Farm Bureau. We spoke at length on provisions in the Farm Bill that will aid Georgia farmers and our rural communities. One of the things we are working closely together on is the state of broadband service in our rural communities. Broadband access is more than a quality of life issue, it’s also an economic and educational issue. 
As we continue to iron out the final version of the Farm Bill, rest assured I will continue fighting for provisions to bridge the digital divide in our rural communities and other policies that aid our Georgia producers and their families.

ALZHEIMER’S ASSOCIATION COFFEE WITH YOUR CONGRESSMAN 
I appreciate the Middle Georgia chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association for hosting a “Coffee with Your Congressman.” During the event, we had the chance to discuss new federal research dollars for Alzheimer’s and legislation currently in Congress that aims to do more to fight this devastating disease. I appreciated hearing their personal stories, and I look forward to continuing to work with them as we explore new ways to research this disease, and hopefully find a cure.

This past week I had the opportunity to meet with the Forsyth chapter of Vietnam Veterans of America to speak about a wide range of issues, including the state of rebuilding our military, reform at the Department of Veterans Affairs, economic growth in the region, and much more. I want to thank them for their service to our great country and their continued leadership in our communities.

Congressman McHenry Weekly Update 


Supporting Our Troops



On Monday, President Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act, which is the earliest it has been signed in four decades. Signing the NDAA not only gives our troops a well-deserved pay raise—the biggest they’ve received in nearly a decade—but it also addresses the readiness gap created during the previous administration. I was proud to support this bipartisan legislation that helps ensure the U.S. military continues to be the best in the world. Click here or on the image below to learn more about the NDAA courtesy of the House Armed Forces Committee.

￼

Recently, the House of Representatives also voted to reform the way our veterans receive healthcare with the goal of making sure they receive the high-quality care they deserve. Just one of the ways we've helped our nation's veterans is passage of the VA MISSION Act. This bill includes important reforms and funds the Choice program, helping veterans access quality care no matter where they live. This ensures veterans like the 52,000 living in the Tenth District can get the care they earned. Click here to learn more about how we are helping our nation's heroes.

Combatting the Opioid Crisis



Over the past several weeks I've had the opportunity to attend several opioid roundtables across the Tenth District. It was informative to hear from community leaders on how best to combat the opioid epidemic here in western North Carolina. Recently, the House has made a $4 billion investment in combating the crisis as part of our continued efforts to end this crisis. Click here (need to add the link) to learn more about how the House of Representatives is combating opioid addiction courtesy of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Click here or on the image below to watch the speech I delivered on the opioid epidemic and the devastation it has caused to families and loved ones in the Tenth District and all across the country.

Welcome to the American Legion World Series



Once again this year, the American Legion World Series has returned to the Tenth District. I'm pleased to welcome visitors from across the US to Shelby, Cleveland County, and the Tenth District. Over the years, the ALWS has become one of our state's biggest annual sporting events and we are expecting huge crowds again this year. Complete details on the games and other fun and patriotic events surrounding this year's ALWS can be found by clicking here or on the image below.

What I Have Been Reading



Cleveland County Deputy expected to be ok after being shot twice

WFAE 

It was wonderful to learn that Cleveland County Sheriff's deputy Tim Sims is expected to recover after being shot late Tuesday night. Our law enforcement officers are dedicated public servants who put their lives on the line to protect us. Thank you to Deputy Sims and all of our Tenth District officers for their service. 


Sadler remembered for believing 'All children can learn'

Gaston Gazette 

Dr. Ed Sadler was a great leader of Gaston County Schools. As a high school student at Ashbrook, I remember his incredible presence; as an adult I recognized how much the people of Gaston County benefited from his work as an educational leader in our state. He was a transformational educator, principal and superintendent. He will be missed. 


Forever Heroes

Hickory Daily Record 

Last Thursday, the American Legion Post 16 hosted the 129th Soldiers Reunion Day in downtown Newton. The reunion is held every year to honor our nation's veterans and the fallen soldiers who paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedoms. I am thankful for all of the brave men and women serving our country and everything they do to keep us safe.

Friends,
 
As your Congressman, I work every day to represent you and I am honored you have given me the opportunity to be your voice in Congress. A big part of that responsibility is going to Washington and making sure they know our community’s priorities. It’s also important that federal officials can hear directly from you. 
 
That’s why I’ve made it a priority to bring Washington officials here so that you can have direct access to decision makers.

Just last week I brought the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to our district for a per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) Community Engagement Event. PFAS is a group of man-made chemicals that have been widely used in everyday products for decades. PFAS compounds also can enter the environment, raising concerns about the potential environmental and health risks. PFAS have been detected in the Cape Fear River, several public water supplies, and groundwater and private wells because of the chemical GenX. 
 
I serve on the Energy and Commerce Committee where I sit on the Environment Subcommittee, so I am on the frontlines of this issue and have been working to ensure the EPA is supporting our state in efforts to not only understand the effects of GenX, but also take the necessary steps to protect our citizens and our environment.

That’s why I am pleased the EPA accepted my invitation to bring a community engagement event to Fayetteville so we could hear directly from the EPA and we could share our GenX concerns. This is one of only four community engagement events the EPA has held nationwide. And with more than 250 attendees, the event was the largest one yet.

Addressing GenX remains a top priority for me, and I’m pleased to see so many constituents come together to share their concerns and recommendations. I’ve been in constant contact with the EPA about GenX to encourage the swift collection and evaluation of data and to help ensure appropriate measures are taken.  

As I’ve said before, “The squeaky wheel gets the grease,” and it’s why I’ve continued to press the EPA on this. We need a thorough examination of the chemical to be able to quickly develop a comprehensive plan for containment and removal at both the federal and state levels. The EPA has said it will develop a PFAS Management Plan for release later this year using information from the National Leadership Summit, public docket, and community engagement events.

This is about our community. 
 
This is about getting results for you and your family. This is about getting true science so we can make good decisions. As your voice in Congress, I will continue to work with local, state and federal stakeholders to get the answers and scientific data we need to tackle GenX.
 
 
Until next week,
￼
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress (NC-08)

NDAA Signed Into Law 
 
 
On Monday President Trump signed the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) into law. This legislation will give over 30,000 active-duty military personnel in South Carolina their largest pay raise in nearly a decade. As a member of Congress, my most important task is to address needs of the men and women serving our country and to ensure that our armed forces are capable of protecting our nation from threats at home and overseas. The 2019 NDAA continues Republican efforts to rebuild our military by funding badly needed equipment upgrades, investments in new military technology, and the largest pay raise for our service members in nine years.

Improving Care for Veterans 
 
 
As part of our efforts to rebuild America's military we have also focused on fulfilling the promises and commitments we have made to our veterans. There are over 50,000 veterans in South Carolina's Seventh Congressional District, and I am so grateful for the sacrifices they have made on behalf of our country. Unfortunately, I have heard from many of them about their negative experiences with the VA. Thanks to landmark legislation passed by this Congress and singed into law by President Trump, including the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act and the VA MISSION Act, we are beginning to see improvements. The House has also passed provisions that will provide a cost-of-living-adjustment for disabled veterans, combat opioid use among veterans, and bring increased accountability to the VA. The best way to honor our brave service members is to ensure they receive the care they need once they return home! 
 

￼
 
 
Continued Growth 
 
 
A recent study by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation projects that nearly 1.4 million full-time jobs will be created by 2025 due to tax reform. Over 20,000 of these jobs will be in South Carolina! The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act put our economy back on the right track, but there is more work to be done. Republicans want to continually improve our tax code and pursue policies that will further strengthen our economy. As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I will keep fighting for policies that lower taxes and create new opportunities for Americans and South Carolinians.

Defending Religious Freedom 
 
 
I recently joined over 100 of my colleagues in filing an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court to prevent the Bladensburg Cross, a memorial built in 1925 to honor 49 fallen World War I soldiers, from being torn down. The Fourth Circuit Court misinterpreted the First Amendment when they ruled that the memorial, which has stood to honor these heroes for 90 years, violated the Establishment Clause. Forcing a group to tear down a cross-shaped memorial, especially one that honors those who died for our country, is an attack on religious freedom and the traditions of our nation. I hope the Supreme Court will clarify rulings that misinterpret the Constitution to protect our religious freedoms as well as memorials across the country that honor our nation's heroes and are a longstanding part of American history.

Hi,
The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has created more economic opportunities for Coloradans across the state, and 90 percent of wage earners are seeing an increase in their paycheck because of a simpler, fairer and flatter income tax.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also included a lesser publicized, but critically important provision to help rural communities prosper. When it comes to economic growth, infrastructure and resources, there is a disparity between the metro Denver area and communities in rural Colorado. About 400,000 people in Colorado are still considered to be living in an economically-distressed area, which is defined as a community with high poverty, high unemployment and low graduation rates. To help bridge the divide, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act established an opportunity zone program which incentivizes investment in economically-distressed areas.
The opportunity zone program allows states to assign 25 percent of their lowest income census tracts as opportunity zones. A census tract is an area with 4,000 residents, and to qualify as an opportunity zone, it must have a poverty rate of at least 20 percent and the average household income must be 80 percent lower than the state’s median household income level.
In March, Governor Hickenlooper and the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade announced the nomination of 126 opportunity zones across the state, with 44 of those zones located in Colorado’s Third Congressional District.
The opportunity zone program will work in the following way: when an investor makes a profit from the sale of a business or stocks, the tax liability on that capital gain will be deferred or even possibly eliminated if the investor chooses to reinvest that profit in an enterprise located within one of the designated opportunity zones. More simply put, this program offers investors an incentive to invest in distressed communities to create economic opportunities in them.
New investment in these communities would include new or expanded businesses bringing more jobs and revenue to the respective communities. That increased revenue could then be used to fund critical local projects including rebuilding schools and infrastructure, and supporting emergency services and law enforcement.
The Economic Innovation Group estimates that there is a total of $6.1 trillion in unrealized capital gains, held either by American families or corporations. If investors reinvest even just a portion of that money back into these communities, the impact could be significant for communities in the Third District and across the state.
Sincerely, 
￼

Walker Weekly Report
￼
On Monday, President Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) into law, meaning that the more than 100,000 servicemen and servicewomen who call North Carolina home are getting their largest pay raise in almost a decade.
The defense bill also provides a path to newer and safer equipment to combat an alarming rise in accidents and fights sexual assault so all in our military can feel safe, confident and cared for. Additionally it invests nearly $250 million in military construction at North Carolina bases like Fort Bragg, Cherry Point and Camp Lejeune. God bless our troops as they address global threats from aggressors like Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, and thank you to all the heroes who came before them.
Keep reading for the full update. Have a blessed week.  Sincerely, ￼ Mark Walker

Celebrating the Community Relations Efforts of the Greensboro Police Department and the Summerfield Fire Department
This week, I thoroughly enjoyed getting to visit with and listen to our community's first responders as we showed them gratitude for their service. Our community is blessed with some of the best. 
The Greensboro Police Department under the leadership of Chief Wayne Scott and the Summerfield Fire Department under the leadership of Chief Chris Johnson have been highly-engaged in community relations and are making a big difference. 
At the fire department, I was very impressed with Jenna Daniels, the Captain of Administration. Jenna grew up in a family of firefighters and always dreamed of continuing in that line of service. Now, she helps train children on fire safety, inspiring other boys and girls to become firefighters. Jenna was awarded the North Carolina State Firemen's Association Firefighter of the Year in 2014 for her work, becoming the first woman to do so.

Triad Business Journal: FedEx Express Will Double Its Workforce at Piedmont Triad International Airport Over the Next Several Months
Great news for our community this week as FedEx announced that it is doubling its workforce in Guilford County, hiring 400 new workers. FedEx had already increased employee wages, awarded bonuses and increased pension following the passage of our tax reform bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
""'We are pleased to see FedEx growing at our airport,' said Kevin Baker, executive director at PTI. 'FedEx Express has been an important employer in the Triad for nearly a decade, but we believe today’s announcement shows the real potential of the FedEx hub. The company will double its local payroll with this expansion.'""

WFMY News 2: Human Trafficking Tip Leads to Search of Hibachi Buffet Restaurant in Burlington
""A neighbor said she saw several groups of people going in and out of the house in vans on multiple occasions. She also said a picket fence built on the porch to hide many shoes at the entrance of the house was something she found odd. She added that she thought the house may have been a boarding house but didn't think there would be a connection to human trafficking.""
The unfortunate reality is that the horrors of human trafficking are not foreign to our community. North Carolina is among the top 10 states in the nation for trafficking cases. In Congress, I have made it a priority to fight this great injustice that destroys, enslaves and exploits human life. 
This year, we passed legislation I co-sponsored, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), which has been signed into law by President Trump and has successfully reduced online advertising for sex trafficking by up to 80 percent. I also wrote the Human Trafficking Detection Act, passed by the 114th Congress and signed into law by President Obama. 
Sheriff Terry Johnson, Chief Jeffrey Smythe and the law enforcement officers of Alamance County have been invaluable partners and advocates in fighting these abhorrent crimes. We must all stay diligent as a community. Life is invaluable and we must do all we can to protect it at every stage.

Decades ago, I remember Oprah Winfrey asking Ms. Franklin about leaving the church to pursue her secular career. Aretha quickly responded, “I never left!” At 73, here was her performance at the Kennedy Center Honors.

8/19/18 13:31,A Tribute to Paul Laxalt ,"￼
￼
￼
￼
￼
￼
"" It didn’t matter if you were a Democrat or Republican, Senator Laxalt would be your friend.""
This week, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a resolution that I introduced to honor the life and legacy of former Nevada governor and U.S. Senator Paul Laxalt. You can learn more about it HERE .
I also spoke on the U.S. Senate floor to pay tribute to the Nevada statesman, who was a hero and mentor to me and many others who grew up in Carson City. You may watch the video of my tribute to Paul Laxalt by clicking HERE , or read the text of the speech, which is available below.
  ￼ 
Click HERE  to view the video. 
Madame President, I come to the floor today to pay tribute and honor to one of the great Nevadans of our lifetime – Senator Paul Laxalt. 
Last week, Senator Laxalt passed away at the age of 96 having forever changed the State of Nevada and this country. 
The state motto in Nevada is “all for our country” and Senator Laxalt exemplified that principle every day by giving his all through public service for every Nevadan. 
Paul Dominique Laxalt was born in August 2, 1922, and grew up in my hometown of Carson City, Nevada.  His parents had both immigrated from the Basque region in Europe and brought their values and traditions to Northern Nevada. 
Every day, Basque influence like chorizo, lamb, and sweetbreads are still staples of life in Northern Nevada. 
As the son of a Basque sheepherder, Paul made his mark early in life by attending Carson City High School, playing on the 1938 state championship basketball team, and as a student body president – which is significant, and I’ll share in a few minutes. 
Paul would go on to serve his country in the U.S. Army as a medic during World War II and saw action in the Philippines. 
After the war, like many Americans, Paul started a family and married Jackalyn Ross in 1946 and had six children: Gail, Sheila, Michelle, Kevin, Kathleen and John Paul. 
Paul began his career in public service when he served as district attorney for what was then Ormsby County, Nevada.  He then won his first statewide race, serving as Lieutenant Governor from ‘63 to 1967.  
During his term, Paul made the decision to run for the U.S. Senate in 1964 and challenged Howard Cannon.  
In one of the closest races in Nevada history, Paul lost his bid for the Senate by just 48 votes.  
A result like that can break a lesser man, but Paul picked himself up and won the Nevada governorship just a few years later. 
Under Governor Laxalt, Nevada began growing and turning into the state that we know today.  He helped establish the community college system and the first medical school in Nevada.  
Under his guidance, Nevada’s gaming industry was transformed, and his vison for our state’s future is now enjoyed by millions of tourists each year who visit Nevada for our world-class attractions, our services, and our entertainment. 
It was during that time that Paul started to become friends with another famous governor in neighboring California — Ronald Reagan.  
Together, they worked to protect and preserve Lake Tahoe for future generations. 
The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency – the TRPA – is the premier bi-state compact to save the Lake, and will celebrate in 2020 its 50 th year. 
After his work as Governor, Paul decided the time was right to make another run for the U.S. Senate.  This time he won and he served the State of Nevada from 1974 to 1987. 
As a United States Senator, he continued his faithful dedication to his friend Ronald Reagan and served as his presidential campaign chairman in 1976, 1980, and 1984.  He also served as General Chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1983 to 1987. 
Senator Laxalt was famously called “the first friend” of President Reagan. Together, they helped each other set our country down a new path of prosperity and freedom. 
Senator Laxalt was a hero and mentor to me and many others who grew up in Carson City.  
Like Paul, my mother, my children and I also went to Carson High School.  I played on the basketball team and my daughter Emmy was the student body president, following in Sen. Laxalt’s shoes. 
Before my daughter Emmy took office, she reached out to previous Carson High School student body presidents to ask for their advice. 
Senator Laxalt was gracious and told her the following: “When I was elected as student body president, Franklin Roosevelt was the President of the United States. With World War II looming on the horizon, my fellow classmates and I had no idea how dramatically our lives would be altered in the next few years.  Of course, the school itself was much different.  I doubt that there were more than 30 students in my entire class.  Until my senior year, all classes -- K through 12 -- were in the same building!” 
He then said: “I'm not entirely comfortable offering advice, particularly to someone who knows more than me!  I would just tell you to have fun and enjoy every single day, remember those who elected you and always do what you -- Emmy Heller -- think is right.” 
I know Emmy has never forgotten that advice. 
Senator Laxalt set a high bar for all of us kids who went to Carson High School, but also showed us all the possibilities of what could be achieved as Nevadans. 
When I was sworn in as a freshman member in the House of Representatives, Senator Laxalt was there for me on day one. 
I’ll never forget his support, and his advice - always stay close to family, friends, and your constituents. They will never leave you astray. 
Having been a presidential campaign advisor to President Reagan, President Bush, and Senator Dole, Senator Laxalt’s advice carried great weight, and I knew I needed to listen to every piece of advice that he was willing to give me. 
Senator Laxalt also had a profound impact on many of my colleagues here in the Senate. 
It didn’t matter if you were a Democrat or Republican, Senator Laxalt would be your friend. 
If fact, on my very first day as a Senator, I remember my colleague Senator Leahy telling me about all of his work and fond memories of his friend Senator Laxalt. 
Senator Laxalt showed all of us what true friendship is.  
His character and warmth that he shared with all of us will never be forgotten. 
I extend my deepest condolences to Senator Laxalt’s wife Carol and to their entire family. 
Madam President, I will miss my friend Senator Laxalt.  His colleagues here in the Senate will miss their friend.  And the people of Nevada will miss their friend.

The Bost Bulletin
Friend:  
I had another busy week all around Southern Illinois. I took a look at dam and lock maintenance in Modoc, met with school administrators in Anna to discuss school safety, stopped by a high tech dairy farm in Red Bud, talked to railroad police in East St. Louis, and toured an ethanol refinery in Sauget, Next week will be just as busy, highlighted by House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Phil Roe joining me on a Veterans Listening Session through Southern Illinois. 
Next Week: Veterans Listening Tour 
This job is about connecting Southern Illinois values to Washington, not the other way around. That’s why I have made an effort to bring key decision makers to our district to hear directly from you – including the President, U.S. Labor Secretary, U.S. Housing Secretary, and the House Armed Services Committee Chairman.  Along those lines, I am excited to announce that next week I will host House Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Phil Roe on my “Veterans Listening Tour” at facilities that serve veterans throughout the region. The tour will include stops at St. Louis Regional Benefits Office, Jefferson Barracks VA Hospital, and Marion VA Medical Center.
￼ 
Most importantly, we want to hear from you. That’s why we will be holding a veterans forum at American Legion Post 2007 located at 216 Service Street, Swansea, IL 62226 from 2:00pm to 3:30pm on Tuesday, August 21. I hope you can make it! 

Touring Our Locks and Dams 
￼ 
I had the opportunity to attend the Lower Kaskaskia stakeholders meeting and tour the Costello Lock and Dam during dewatering. Dewatering is important for the Army Corps of Engineers to observe what maintenance needs to be done. The lock entered service in 1973 and this is the first time the lock has been completely dewatered. The Kaskaskia is the eighth largest inland waterway port in the country and vitally important to our economy by supporting the shipment of approximately 1.4 million tons of cargo every year.

Talking School Safety in Anna 
￼

I was at Anna Junior High School to talk with faculty about the School Violence Prevention Program. Union County schools are currently in the application process for federal grants through this program, which was created by my bipartisan legislation that was recently signed into law. 

High Tech Dairy Farming in Red Bud 
￼ 
Farming is hard work with long hours. But leveraging technology creates productivity and extraordinary quality in the agriculture industry. I saw firsthand this technology in action at the fully-automated, father-son Reinhardt dairy farm in Red Bud. Agricultural operations like this are exactly why the Farm Bill makes major investments in rural broadband to benefit under-served areas like Southern Illinois.

Meeting with Law Enforcement in East St. Louis 
￼ 
I had a very productive meeting with the Missouri and Illinois Railroad Police Association in East Saint Louis about some of the unique challenge they face. Since 9/11, they have played a vitally important role in our nation’s homeland security.

Touring the Ethanol Refinery in Sauget 
￼ 
I met with employees at Center Ethanol in Sauget to check out their massive operation. Using almost 20 million bushels of corn, the plant produces over 50 million gallons of ethanol per year!
That’s a quick update on what I’ve been up to. I hope you have a great week ahead!

Tenney Kicks Off Third Week of Renew NY-22 With Tax Reform Week 
On Tuesday I kicked off Tax Reform Week, the third week of Renew NY-22, with a roundtable hosted by the Herkimer County Chamber which included local business owners and stakeholders. Nearly 20 businesses attended the roundtable to discuss tax reform, business climate and workforce development. As part of Tax Reform Week, I will travel the district highlighting the many ways tax reform has improved the lives of businesses and families throughout the district, allowing families to keep more of their money and empowering more businesses to grow and hire.   As I meet with business owners, families and small farmers across the 22nd District, it is clear that tax reform is working and providing the critical relief they need to grow. The typical family of four in the 22nd District is saving more than $2,400 per year. For most New Yorkers, that’s an extra mortgage payment, a down-payment for a new car or money for their children’s education. It certainly isn’t crumbs. Our national economy is on the rise and our local economy is continuing on a positive, upward trajectory. Businesses are back on the path to prosperity and families have more opportunities to plan for the future.  In Congress, I have supported: Permanent Tax Cuts for Americans Act, Permanent Tax Relief for Working Families Act (permanent child tax credit), Repeal of Medical Device Tax, $10,000 SALT Deduction, preservation of the Historic Tax Credit, Deductibility of Medical Expenses, Section 199 Deduction for Farmers, Balanced Budget Amendment, Death Tax Repeal, Financial Choice Act, Property Tax Reduction Act, Community Institution Mortgage Relief, Save Local Business Act, Promoting Affordable Child Care for Everyone (PACE) Act, Veteran Entrepreneurs Act.  
￼ 
On Wednesday, I held a roundtable with the Greater Binghamton Chamber of Commerce and local business owners to discuss how tax reform has improved the lives of people in the 22nd District. 
Tax reform starts with providing relief to the hard-working families and small businesses that power our economy. Families are keeping more of their hard-earned money, and our businesses and farms are able to grow and hire more staff. During the roundtable, I spoke with local business owners who have benefited from tax reform. Todd Stupski, owner of J&R Upholstery, bought more machinery, hired more workers, and reinvested back in the business. John Matthews, CEO of BSC Associates, was able to give a greater bonus with increased flexibility due to tax reform. Although tax reform is improving the lives of all businesses and employees, our small business community agrees that the cost of Obamacare is hurting their ability to grow. 
The Greater Binghamton Chamber is currently working on an apprenticeship program to improve education and training programs. Last month, I attended President Trump’s remarks on the Pledge to the American Worker. There, the President signed an executive order to enhance vocational training, creating a national council for U.S. workers and a workforce policy advisory board. During the ceremony, companies from across the country signed the pledge to create 500,000 new career and development opportunities for students and workers. 
￼ 
As a direct result of tax reform, small business owners have given back to their employees, invested more into their business and ultimately grown our economy. Thank you to the Job Creators Network for presenting me with the Defender of Small Business Award. In Congress, I will continue to support pro-growth legislation to ensure small businesses in the 22nd District have the tools necessary to succeed.

A bill that I recently introduced, the Threat Assessment, Prevention, and Safety (TAPS) Act (H.R. 6664), received the endorsement of the Association of Threat Assessment Professionals (ATAP) at the organization’s annual Threat Management Conference.  

ATAP is made up of dedicated professionals who already serve on the front lines of protecting our communities, schools, and public figures by using the proven method proposed by the TAPS Act. I am honored to have their support as we move forward to reshape the way we assess and mitigate threats and save lives.

Americans are tired of political rhetoric and want a solution to these devastating incidents of targeted violence happening across our country. I believe we’ve found the answer with the TAPS Act.

Helping Our Farmers Thrive
￼
Thanks to all of the board members from Jasper, Hardin, Tyler, and Polk County who attended our Texas Farm Bureau Dinner last week!
As the Representative for TX-36, I know that the hard work that our farmers and ranchers do is crucial not only for our towns and communities, but to our nation. We need to ensure a competitive environment for our agriculture industry that is not hindered by unfair subsidies and practices of other countries that harm the American farmer. America is always the first to be hurt by unfair trade practices – especially our agriculture industry – so we must correct those bad policies to protect our farmers.   Without a competitive environment and fair prices, the consequences can be a matter of national security – a nation without a certain amount of self-sustainability, especially when it comes to food, is a weak one. I’m working hard in Congress to make sure this vital industry has the support needed in order to thrive.
Our Heroes Are Better Off Now
￼
 This past week, President Trump signed into law the FY19 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a bill that will enable our military to rebuild and reassert itself as a world leader after years in decline. Not only does the NDAA reverse the damage of the last Administration for our military, it will also give our troops the largest pay raise in nearly a decade – well-deserved!  Together, the Republican Congress and the Trump Administration are working to provide our troops with the tools necessary to defend against threats – both here in the U.S. and around the world. There is always more work to be done, but the NDAA is an important step in bringing the U.S. military back.

Working to Expand Prosperity for All Pennsylvanians
This week, the Washington Examiner profiled my work over the past two years to expand prosperity for all Pennsylvanians and my role in the biggest legislative issues of this session of Congress.
The piece is below, in its entirety, and I hope you will take a few minutes to check it out.
Pat Toomey, the supply-siders' field marshal in the Senate Washington Examiner  By Joseph Lawler August 14, 2018  https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/pat-toomey-the-supply-siders-field-marshal-in-the-senate  
In a meeting in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office almost a year ago, Pat Toomey and Bob Corker reached a deal: They would include a tax cut of up to $1.5 trillion in the Republican budget.
Few realized it at the time, but their agreement was critical to the realization of the GOP tax code rewrite.
For one thing, by agreeing on a budget, they unlocked the special legislative procedure that allowed them to circumvent a Democratic filibuster. And by allowing for $1.5 trillion in revenue losses in that budget, they created fiscal space for the tax cuts they'd been dreaming of for years: Lower corporate rates, lower individual rates, a shrunken estate tax, and much more.
The budget deal was just one of several Toomey interventions that proved critical to passing the GOP tax bill. ""He was like the field marshal, so to speak,"" said Stephen Moore, an adviser to top Republicans and supply-side evangelists.
Although he doesn't have the national status of some of his conservative Senate GOP colleagues, Toomey has worked behind the scenes and used the levers of power in the Senate to enforce and advance supply-side conservatism during the Trump era.
On taxes, financial regulation, Obamacare and free trade, he's managed to set the right edge for the Senate Republican caucus, all while representing a purple state. He has helped President Trump as much as anyone when Trump has pursued free-market policies.
But, unlike erstwhile supply-side conservatives who have accommodated themselves to populism this Congress, Toomey is not simply following the Trump train down the tracks. Instead, he's providing congressional resistance to the president's protectionist trade agenda.
AN AGGRESSIVE PLAN FROM THE START
While other Republicans were still simply finding their footing in the new Trump-dominated landscape, Toomey began drafting a plan for the unified GOP government to undo just about all of President Obama's domestic legacy.
Toomey, having just won reelection in a come-from-behind victory, plotted for Republicans to undo Obama's healthcare law, his tax hikes and his Wall Street reform, all without wasting time trying to gain Democratic support.
Even before Trump took the oath of office in January of 2017, Toomey began pressuring his GOP colleagues on the Senate floor to sidestep a Democratic filibuster and undo big provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, using the procedural tool of budget reconciliation. That tool allows legislation to pass with only a simple majority in the Senate, and Republicans would use the same procedure for health care and tax legislation.
The GOP would eventually fall short of repealing Obamacare or Dodd-Frank. But in both cases, Toomey shaped GOP policy and then later won more modest victories.
Senate Republicans' doomed Obamacare replacement, for example, contained a major healthcare spending reduction won by Toomey. The bill would have tied federal funding for Medicaid, the low-income health program administered by states, to the number of people in each state. That funding then would have been capped to grow with overall inflation, rather than with medical prices, resulting in huge spending reductions over time.
Amid everything else that was going on at the Capitol at that time, few people registered the significance of what Toomey had done - although conservative columnist George Will, one of the few to take notice, described it as ""this century's most significant domestic policy reform.""
Republicans initially rejected the idea of much lower Medicaid spending. Toomey convinced them, or at least most of them, by arguing that it is simply unsustainable for a spending program to grow faster than the economy in perpetuity.
Ultimately, the GOP failed and the reform wasn't signed into law. But Toomey would later succeed in repealing at least part of Obamacare as part of the tax bill.
TAX MATH
The tax legislation zeroed out Obamacare's individual mandate penalties, thanks to an amendment added by Toomey and Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton.
The mandate elimination was also another idea that scared many Republicans, who were fearful of importing the politics of healthcare - a loser - into the push for tax cuts. Eventually the whole Senate GOP bought into the idea after the budget math was explained: Repealing the mandate would mean fewer people signing up for subsidized healthcare plans, creating savings that could be used for tax cuts.
Unlike the Obamacare repeal, the tax overhaul did clear the Senate and reached Trump's desk, a process kicked off by the Toomey-Corker budget deal.
Before the deal, when Republicans were first turning to taxes after giving up on healthcare, their leaders shared a goal that the tax bill should not add to deficits. Any revenues that would be lost through lower rates would have to be recouped by eliminating a commensurate number of special tax breaks, credits, deductions and loopholes. Politically, it was a treacherously difficult task, one that eluded Congress for a generation.
Both McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan had called for such revenue-neutral tax reform. They did so partly for procedural reasons: Under the budget reconciliation rules, a money-losing tax overhaul would have to be made only temporary.
A hurdle emerged when some supply-side Republicans calculated that it would cost the Treasury at least $5 trillion over 10 years to enact all of the tax cuts that Republicans wanted, including the 20 percent corporate tax rate, estate tax repeal, and individual tax reductions.
Republicans could only come up with around $3 trillion in tax breaks they would eliminate, even if they killed the most popular credits and deductions. There was simply no way to close the $2 trillion-plus difference.
In response, Toomey advocated for the budget to allow for $2.5 trillion in deficits. Knowing that a revenue-losing tax cut could not be permanent under reconciliation, Toomey had been campaigning since the spring for a creative workaround. His suggestion was to lengthen the budget timeframe from the typical 10 years to 20 or 30 years - unusual, but not prohibited. A tax cut of that length, even if technically temporary, would be permanent for businesses' investing purposes.
""We can't let a fixation on deficit predictions or arcane budget rules get in the way,"" Toomey argued at the time.
Corker, meanwhile, a self-described fiscal conservative, wanted the revenue losses to be $0. Seeing the differences between the two senators, McConnell in August directed the two of them, both members of the Budget Committee, to find a compromise.
After several weeks, the two settled on the $1.5 trillion figure. That was the outer limit of what Corker thought could be made up by faster economic growth if they went on to write a tax bill that sparked enormous new business activity. From the Toomey perspective, the $1.5 trillion limit would mean giving up some of the tax cut goals the GOP started out with, but would still allow for a lot.
In the end, the bill would include many, if not all, of the supply-side priorities. By the time Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, held a Capitol Hill press event in mid-September to demand a hard-right tax bill filled with a wish list of cuts, Toomey was already nearing the deal with Corker to achieve what he wanted.
BITING OFF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN FINANCE
In the area of finance, Toomey didn't get his way. The chairman of the Banking Committee, Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, chose instead to work with Democrats to pass a centrist regulatory relief package, rather than attempt to ram through a partisan rollback of Dodd-Frank.
Nevertheless, Toomey found other avenues to push the envelope on deregulation.
Toomey is ""doing as much as he can behind the scenes to wring out every last possible benefit of having full Republican control in Washington,"" one financial services lobbyist remarked.
For example, in May, Congress passed and Trump signed a measure ending an Obama-era crackdown on discriminatory auto lending by non-dealer finance companies, a regulatory rollback facilitated by Toomey.
The elimination of the regulation was procedural ingenuity.
The Congressional Review Act allows for Congress to strike down new agency rules through a simple majority vote, without a filibuster. What makes it complicated is that the auto lending regulation wasn't officially a rule, and it wasn't new. Rather, it was regulatory guidance that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had published in 2013 informing third-party auto financiers that they were subject to laws preventing discriminatory lending.
Republicans had long complained that the 2013 move was an example of Obama overreach, with an agency flouting the law to impose controversial regulations on an industry - auto dealers - that it was prohibited by law from regulating.
In 2017, Toomey found a way to take action. His office requested that the Government Accountability Office issue a ruling whether the CFPB guidance could be treated as rule for Congress' purposes, an idea exhumed from the legislative record of 2008, when Democrats tried to kill a memo published by the George W. Bush Department of Health relating to the implementation of the State Children‘s Health Insurance Program.
When the GAO said that the guidance did constitute an official rule, Congress passed a Congressional Review Act resolution striking it down as if it were a new rule, with the eager support of the finance and auto dealer industries.
The maneuver raised a prospect that frightened Democrats: Congress could reach deep into agency archives and pull out old regulations to kill.
ALWAYS CONSERVATIVE, NEWLY POWERFUL
Toomey has always been a conservative lawmaker. He amassed a right-wing record as a congressman from 1999 to 2005, and then ran the Club for Growth, an outside group that backs staunch conservatives and opposes primary Republicans who deviate from low-tax, low regulation orthodoxy.
But now he is in a position to wield tremendous influence over fiscal policy, and has the experience to do so. His power could grow even greater next year, if Republicans maintain control and he ascends to the Banking Committee chairmanship, as some members and lobbyists speculate he might.
When Club for Growth president David McIntosh, then representing Indiana, served with Toomey in the House, the two new lawmakers would joke that their conservative efforts were undercut by higher-ups cutting deals in some backroom from which they were excluded. Last year, as Toomey was working on deals on healthcare, taxes and finance, he joked to McIntosh that the backroom is real - and the dealing is even worse than they both suspected.
Toomey ""plays the inside game almost better than anybody I've ever seen,"" said James Wallner, a former GOP Senate aide who now researches legislative procedure at the R Street Institute.
He works, Republicans said, not by trying to position himself in the ideological middle, but rather by staking out his own conservative positions, developing strong arguments for them, and then working to find compromises with his colleagues. He spends more time than most senators thinking through the issues the same way a debater would - testing lines of argument and preparing for rejoinders in order to present a coherent case for his positions - rather than just talking points.
Toomey was one of a group of four senior Finance Committee Republicans who took responsibility for explaining the tax plan to other Republicans and easing their qualms. The group spoke with senators individually, or when they came across a particular issue, the four would sit down with one or multiple members - conservative, moderate, or in between - in McConnell's office to talk it through.
In mid-November, when Ron Johnson, R-Wis., announced that he would oppose the tax bill because it put small businesses at a disadvantage, it was Toomey who took the lead in working through the hold-up and saving the bill, said Moore. ""People don't realize how close we came to not getting that bill passed,"" he remarked.
Johnson, who began his career as an accountant, was holding out for bigger tax breaks for businesses that file as individuals, such as sole proprietorships and partnerships. He feared that without bigger tax breaks, such ""pass-through"" businesses would be left at a disadvantage to the C corporations that were slated to get a tax rate of near 20 percent.
A C corporation, under United States federal income tax law, refers to any corporation that is taxed separately from its owners and it is distinguished from an S corporation, which generally is not taxed separately.
Toomey was able to speak to Johnson at at technical level. Their offices exchanged many versions of spreadsheets comparing effective tax rates for different business structures and scenarios. Eventually, Republicans found a way to increase the break for pass-through businesses to a size big enough to switch Johnson to a ""yes"" vote.
CREDIT FOR BEING RED IN PURPLE
The same approach that he's used in the Senate has served Toomey well in Pennsylvania, a commonwealth much less conservative than his voting record.
""Pat Toomey's political strengths in Pennsylvania and his success in the Senate really have the same source,"" said Jon Lerner, the lead consultant for Toomey's 2010 and 2016 campaigns. ""They both come from his combination of super high intelligence and uncommon personal decency.""
Lerner suggested that Toomey wins support from voters who don't necessarily agree with his conservative worldview because they see that he comes by it honestly and through study.
His success has been a source of frustration to state Democrats who have been unable to convince voters, so far, that he is as conservative as he is.
""Senator Toomey and his Republican friends have spent the past two years pushing a tax plan that hurts the middle class by increasing their taxes, stripping them of their healthcare and protections for pre-existing conditions, and laying the burden of debt on their children,"" said Brandon Cwalina, a representative for the Pennsylvania Democratic Party.
For Republicans, though, Toomey's ability to amass a hard-right record in a purple state means that he should get extra credit.
""His job is harder because he's got to do more to sell his views to his constituents,"" said Phil Gramm, a former Texas senator and staunch supply-side fiscal conservative.
Gramm, a former academic economist, said Toomey was the congressional leader on free-market orthodoxy, in a group with only Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas. He noted, though, that Hensarling faces little risk back home in the Dallas suburbs of being seen as too far to the right.
Toomey bought himself a lot of space on economic issues by departing with other conservatives on the gun issue. In the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., he introduced legislation in 2013 with Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia to expand background checks. The effort cost him with some right-wingers and risked alienating voters in rural Pennsylvania, but ""gave him credibility in the suburbs,"" said McIntosh.
TRUMP AT A DISTANCE
Another key strategy in his 2016 race was to keep Trump at an arm's length, infamously declining to say whether he'd vote for him until right before polls closed.
Perhaps no legislator has done more since to aid Trump's legislative victories on taxes and banking. But now Toomey is poised for conflict with Trump over his trade agenda.
Last month, the Senate voted 88-11 on a non-binding resolution calling on Trump to get approval from Congress before imposing tariffs using authority supposed to be used for national security purposes. Trump has used that authority to impose broad steel and aluminum tariffs and threaten more levies on trade counterparties.
The vote won't actually tie Trump's hands. Republican leaders have avoided forcing members to take a vote defying the president.
Yet the resolution, authored by Toomey and Corker, presents a model for Congress to act if, in the future, Trump goes so far that reluctant Republicans have no choice but to cross him.
""It's time for Congress to reassert its constitutional responsibility on trade,"" Toomey said after the vote. ""We've crossed the Rubicon,"" on Trump's trade policies, the Pennsylvania senator Politico in June.
It's a particularly risky stance for Toomey given Pennsylvania's heritage as a pro-union, pro-protectionist economy. Pennsylvania's other senator, Democrat Bob Casey, has been more welcoming of Trump's tariffs and less supportive of legislation to limit Trump's tariffs power.
""For him to be out in front on things like free trade and sort of rejecting populism in favor of free market economics is a really big deal,"" said Jason Pye, vice president of legislative affairs for FreedomWorks, a libertarian advocacy group.
Toomey's partner on the tariffs legislation, Corker, is from a state that is traditionally more supportive of free trade. Corker's also retiring after this year, and won't have to answer for defying Trump to primary voters.
One reason he's banded with Toomey on the issue, a person close to Corker said, is that they developed a particular regard for each others' intelligence and improved their working relationship in the long discussions last year during the negotiations leading to the $1.5 trillion tax cut number.

Helping Constituents...
Dear Friend:
As another week of summer ends, I appreciate you taking the time to read this week’s brief update—it is an honor to represent you in Washington, D.C!  One of the most important aspects of my job is helping the residents of the 6th Congressional District through constituent services. Whether you have questions about Social Security benefits, need help obtaining a passport, or even something as simple as getting an update from a federal agency on the status of your application, my office is here to help! Some of the cases we deal with are much more complicated and I want to take this opportunity to discuss a difficult case we had just this week.   Right after learning about the Becerra family's nightmare of having their adopted 4-year old daughter, Angela, facing deportation, unless nothing further could be done, my office immediately reached out to them to offer my assistance in finding out how everything, with U.S. Customs and Immigration Services, had gone so horribly wrong. Angela was on a path to lose her legal residency status by the end of the month giving her parents, who are both U.S. citizens, no other choice but to return to Peru, where Angela was adopted from, due to the bureaucratic red tape and a broken immigration system even though the Becerra’s had taken all the steps necessary to legally adopt her. 
￼

their home after a positive meeting with the local USCIS field office. 
After meeting with Angela’s family and reviewing the facts with them, my immigration case worker contacted the local US Customs and Immigration Service to reconsider the case in hopes of obtaining a favorable outcome for this family-- as such was the end result. With the threat of deportation now behind them, the Becerra family is now working through my office to file the necessary paperwork to keep Angela permanently in the United States and on a path toward citizenship. 
Spending time in Colorado also affords me the opportunity to get out and visit with the local nonprofit service organizations in our community. This week, I visited the ‘Town of Littleton Cares’ (TLC) Meals on Wheels chapter. This volunteer-driven service organization provides approximately 435 daily meals to home-bound seniors. Like all other Meal on Wheels chapters across our nation, the Littleton chapter is funded by a combination of local charitable donations and state-administered federal grants. When Congress last voted to continue these grants, by approving the Older Americans Act in 2016, I voted in favor of continuing them because I have seen how cost-effective these program are in enabling low income seniors to remain in their own homes longer instead of nursing homes paid for by taxpayers under the Medicaid program.

During my visit with the volunteers at Littleton Meals on Wheels, I had the opportunity to help prepare meals and to help deliver them meals to eligible seniors. I enjoyed this visit and encourage you to consider volunteering either with Meals on Wheels or another nonprofit service organization within our community. The Littleton Meals on Wheels chapter will celebrate their 50th anniversary this coming Sunday! I congratulate TLC Meals on Wheels on reaching this milestone and deeply appreciate their five decades of service in our community.
As always, I invite you to follow me on Facebook or Twitter to get the latest news it develops. Likewise, you can find all the latest news on my website. I look forward to seeing you around the district!
Sincerely,

THE SCALISE CAPITOL REPORT
Fighting for Strong Hurricane Protection
This week, I was able to evaluate the 17th Street Canal pumping station and talk with local, state and federal flood protection officials. As we enter the height of the 2018 Atlantic Hurricane Season, it's so important our region is ready for whatever may come our way. Hopefully the full capacity of the 17th Street Canal pump station is never needed, but it is important to know that the system is ready and fully capable of operating to its highest level if the worst kind of storm happens.

While this pump station and the rest of the New Orleans area flood protection system are critical parts of our defense system against powerful storms, much work remains to ensure protection for all areas across Southeast Louisiana, and I will continue to fight every day for additional flood protections and coastal restoration efforts in Congress.
I spoke with FOX 8, along with Colonel Michael Clancy of the Army Corps of Engineers, about this. Click here or on the image below to watch.  
￼

￼
Col. Clancy, Joe Hassinger, the President of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East (SLFPA-E), Gerard Gillen III, Chief of Operations at SLFPA-E, and I discuss the capabilities of the station.

Seeing the pumps first-hand and discussing the capacity of the station.
The Importance of Flood Insurance As we are entering the riskiest time of hurricane season, I encourage everyone to get flood insurance.  While I continue to fight for reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program that would bring additional and more affordable options for Louisiana families, I am working with a bipartisan coalition in Congress to ensure the NFIP is affordable and sustainable and remains fair for homeowners and taxpayers.   I successfully led the effort with my colleague Rep. Tom MacArthur of New Jersey in July to pass our legislation that would ensure the NFIP wouldn’t lapse during hurricane season. Our bill, which received large majorities in both the House and Senate and was signed by President Trump, extends the NFIP through November 30. While it was critical that we passed an extension to make sure the program wouldn’t lapse, I’m continuing to fight for a long term NFIP reauthorization so that families in South Louisiana have peace of mind when it comes to flood insurance.   Visit floodsmart.gov for more information about the National Flood Insurance Program.  It is an honor to represent you in Congress. For more information please visit my website, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook pages.   God Bless,
￼

August 19, 2018
Dear Friend,  
 The August District work period is always extremely busy and productive time of year.  Last week was no exception.  I celebrated legislative accomplishments and worked to build consensus on other legislative priorities.  Additionally, I met with several groups of constituents, visited local businesses and schools, and worked on individual constituents’ casework. Every interaction I have with the people I serve helps me to better member of Congress.  So, thank you for taking the time to share your opinions and concerns with me-whether in writing, by phone, through email or in a face to face meeting.   I appreciate the opportunity to learn from you.  
Click below to read more about my work last week! 
Fighting for Veterans 
I am proud that a bill I authored, the Special Priority on Aircrafts and Coverage Equity Act (SPACE-A), was signed into law last week as part of the National Defense Authorization Act. The provision will allow Veterans, who have a 100% service-connected disability, to utilize a benefit to travel on military aircraft when there is extra space onboard.   The Space Available Travel program is a benefit rightfully extended to all military retirees, yet it excludes those who are 100% disabled. The brave men and women who served our country, and returned home injured, have already paid a big price on our behalf. If there is space available for travel on a military aircraft, there is no reason our 100% disabled Veterans shouldn’t be on that flight. Like most good ideas, this legislation originated from a local constituent. It has been my privilege to fight for this common sense provision that will assist our disabled Veterans. Click on this article to learn more. 
This provision is the 8th provision I've introduced that has been signed into law since January 2017.  An additional nine initiatives I have authored have passed the House in this time frame and are awaiting Senate action. President Reagan once talked about how much we can accomplish if we don’t care who gets the credit. That’s been my approach to ensuring that these tangible public policy improvements get enacted. I rely on my bi-partisan relationships with committee leadership, other Members of Congress and staff to achieve consensus and have these measures placed in large must pass bills. These are important provisions that will improve the lives of the constituents in District 12. For a complete listing of these 17 measures, click here for those that passed the House and here for those which were signed into law.  
One of the most important things I can do as your Congressman is to help you resolve problems you are having with a federal agency.  This story highlights one example of what we can do to be of assistance.  I'm glad that we were able to help this Veteran. I am fortunate to have an amazing team of caseworkers who work daily to advocate on behalf of constituents. If you are having a problem with a federal agency, please contact my office to see if we can help. The number is 727-232-2921. 
Also, it is always an educational and enjoyable experience to meet with my Veterans Advisory Committee.  This group of dedicated Veterans are passionate about helping me craft sound public policy that will benefit the Veteran community.  I appreciate their volunteerism, advice and expertise.  
￼ 
Protecting our Children 
As our children settle in to their new classrooms, I am mindful of the need to keep our children safe.  I was honored to be on hand for a smooth start to the school year at Paul R. Smith Middle (PRSMS), Anclote High (AHS) and Gulfside Elementary (GSES) schools in Holiday last week. I had the privilege of talking to Pasco County Sheriff’s Office Corporals who serve as certified School Resource Officers (SROs), a newly hired School Security Guard and principals about the unique and important role that School Resource Officers play in providing school security, mentorship and promoting positive behaviors to prevent bullying and substance abuse. Principal DiVincent of PRSMS shared that Corporal Mills’ presence on his school campus makes everyone feel more secure, and allows teachers to focus on their primary mission of teaching. Additionally, he noted his significant concerns about Florida school diverting millions of dollars from classroom instruction into school security funding.  
My bill, the PROTECT KIDS Act, will help fund School Resource Officers through a matching grant program.  School Resource Officers around the country, and right here at home, have made a positive impact. This story highlights just one of the countless heroic stories that illustrate the importance of having a school resource officer on every campus. It is important that we provide sufficient funding to keep our children safe—it is a priority!  I will continue to fight until this bill is signed into law. 
￼ 
Strengthening the Economy and Supporting Small Businesses 
I was happy to have the opportunity to provide a legislative update to the Tarpon Springs Chamber of Commerce last week.  It was great to celebrate the recent success we had in securing federal funding to dredge the Anclote River, which will help to even further strengthen our regional economy.  We also talked about other important measures that can ensure small businesses continue to thrive. 
￼ 
 Additionally, I was the guest speaker at this month’s meeting of the Central Pasco Chamber of Commerce in Lutz. It was great to have an open discussion about their priorities which include: tax reform, continuing the economy’s growth, school safety, protecting Veterans and transportation improvements.
￼ 
During district work periods I try to visit as many small businesses as possible.  Last week, I enjoyed visiting a local small business, Sun-Rock, Inc.  This creative company manufactures a cement-coated high density foam for architectural designs such as; window bands, arches, crown molding and columns. I was particularly impressed with the company’s newest initiative, ARK PROJECT, through which it is able to quickly assemble a temporary shelter that is dry, fire resistant and insulated from both heat and cold weather elements.  I believe this product could be useful during the response to an emergency or catastrophic event.   It is great to see American innovation alive and well, right here in our community. 
￼ 
Supporting Key Infrastructure and Critical Community Resources 
It was great to tour the city of Dunedin’s wastewater treatment and water treatment plants last week.  I enjoyed talking with the team members tasked with ensuring the smooth operation of this critical infrastructure, and discussing their vision for being able to continue to meet the needs of our community.  
I also enjoyed meeting with the Cole Link Foundation. It has embarked upon two important community projects.  The first will allow the organization to provide supportive services to targeted populations in need of additional assistance in Tarpon Springs including:  the homeless, Veterans and single parents. The second project is hosting a Community Seniors' Prom.  Its’ goal is to host an inter-generational event for residents in both Pasco and Pinellas counties.  I look forward to seeing these initiatives come to fruition. 
Thank you for reading this week’s update. Feel free to share this e-newsletter with friends and encourage them to sign up! Remember, you can always stay in touch with me via email, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 

Sincerely,

Friends,
Providing for Our Troops
On Monday, the President signed the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (NDAA) into law. One of the most important functions of government is to provide for the defense of this great nation. We can't carry out this mission if our planes can't fly and our ships can't float. Properly funding the U.S. Department of Defense is critical to America's safety and security. This legislation helps us fulfill our promise to protect the American people. 
￼
I was proud to help secure $8.8 million for the Youngstown Air Reserve Station (YARS) in the recent John S. McCain NDAA bill that was signed into law. This money will be used for necessary upgrades at the base. 
On Friday, I was able to see first-hand the new state-of-the-art firing range at YARS. In 2015, I helped secure funding for this $8.5 million range which will be shared with local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. These folks deserve the best training and equipment available, and I'm proud to have been a part of this effort. Congratulations to everyone who helped make this range at YARS possible, especially the United States Air Force. Your hard work truly paid off!
￼
￼
American Manufacturing
Manufacturing supports more than 600,000 jobs in Ohio alone and helps fuel our local, state, and national economies. I enjoyed touring Rockwell Automation in Twinsburg on Monday, with folks from the National Association of Manufacturers. We discussed tax reform and my efforts to ensure workers have the skill-set needed to fill these jobs. 
￼
￼
Addressing Northeast Ohio Priorities
It's always an honor to speak at the annual 3Chamber luncheon, which includes the Solon Chamber of Commerce, Twinsburg Chamber of Commerce, and Aurora Chamber of Commerce. I spoke to over 150 city, business, and education leaders about the bipartisan work Congress has done to strengthen our communities, which is often not seen in the news. My colleagues and I have passed hundreds of bills in the 115th Congress to address Northeast Ohio priorities like: 
	•	Reforming the VA
	•	Addressing the Opioid Epidemic
	•	Protecting the Great Lakes 
￼
￼
GLRI Success Story
Many people in Northeast Ohio know how vital the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) is to protecting and preserving our waterways in OH-14. The GLRI helps us address things like combatting harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie and keeping invasive species like Asian carp out of the Great Lakes. 
Wednesday, I got to tour the Cleveland Museum of Natural History's Litt Preserve, a 26-acre property in Ashtabula County that is permanently protected because of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. Special thanks to the Western Reserve Land Conservancy and Ashtabula County Metroparks for making the visit possible. 
Simply put, these conservation projects in Ashtabula County and throughout Northeast Ohio don't happen without the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. That's why I have and will continue to fight so hard for it. This is how government should work; public-private partnerships leveraging resources to protect environmental treasures like the Great Lakes for our kids and grandkids. 
Preparing the Future Workforce
I saw first-hand the great work being done at the Ashtabula Technical Education & Career Center! A-Tech, as it's called, prepares NE Ohio high school students and adults with the skills and hands-on experience necessary for 21st Century jobs in a broad range of industries.
Last month, I was proud to support the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, which will help more Ohioans compete for jobs and succeed in their careers. The law aligns Career and Technical Education programs with in-demand jobs, rather than preparing students to compete in yesterday's workforce. 
Nursing is one of the most popular workforce development programs that A-Tech offers. As the husband of a nurse and co-chair of the Congressional Nursing Caucus, I understand that we need to do all we can to ensure that those who want to pursue a nursing career, like the students at A-Tech, have access to high-quality education opportunities. That's what my bill, the Title VIII Nursing Workforce Reauthorization Act of 2018 does by providing greater access to advanced education for America's nurses. I was proud to share with A-Tech that this legislation passed the House unanimously last month. Time for the Senate to act!

Hope you have a great week.

EMPOWERING PHARMACISTS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST OPIOID ABUSE

As a pharmacist for more than 30 years, I know the important role the profession plays in combating the opioid crisis our nation is facing. Pharmacists are the last line of defense against drug abuse.

That is why I worked with my friend Representative Mark DeSaulnier from California to craft legislation to help give pharmacists a greater understanding and ability to decline to fill controlled substance prescriptions that are fraudulent, forged, or appear to be for abuse or diversion.

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CLXXV

Monday, August 13, 2018:  In Congress I have the honor of serving on the oldest standing legislative committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, the Energy and Commerce (E&C) Committee.  The committee was originally established on December 14, 1795, as the Committee on Commerce and Manufactures to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States.”   The committee also has the broadest jurisdiction of any committee with responsibility for things such as telecommunications, consumer protection, food and drug safety, public health and research, environmental quality, energy policy, and interstate and foreign commerce among others.  During the 114th Congress nearly 67% of all the legislation that was voted on in the House came through our committee.  As the only member of the Georgia delegation on the committee, I take this responsibility very serious.  This morning I fly to Seattle, WA, to meet with various companies that fall under our jurisdiction.  After arriving in Seattle this afternoon, my first meeting is with the Weyerhaeuser Company at their national headquarters. 
￼
Rep. Carter touring Weyerhaeuser Company
Founded by Frederick Weyerhaeuser in 1900 in Tacoma, WA, Weyerhaeuser is one of the largest sustainable forest products companies in the world and has a strong presence in our District.  Forestry has a $35 billion economic impact per year in the state of Georgia and generates over 145,000 jobs, making our state the number one forestry state in the nation.   
Tuesday, August 14, 2018:  This morning I’m visiting the headquarters of Amazon, the largest internet retailer in the world and the most valuable retailer in the United States by market capitalization.  Founded by Jeff Bezos on July 5, 1994, Amazon started as an online bookstore and later diversified into a number of areas including electronics, audio files, music, furniture, food and more.  After a tour of the Spheres, a place where employees can think and work differently surrounded by more than 40,000 plants from the cloud forest regions of over 30 countries, I visit an Amazon Go store where no checkout is required. 
￼
Rep. Carter touring Amazon's headquarters
You simply use the Amazon Go app to enter the store, take the products you want, and go with no lines and no checkout. Afterwards, I sit down with management to discuss cybersecurity and privacy issues.  Next, I head to Microsoft in Redmond, WA, a multinational computer technology corporation founded on April 4, 1975, by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Most of us know the story of the founding of Microsoft, but I was unaware that they started in Albuquerque and didn’t move to the Seattle area until 1979.  During my almost 3 hour visit I meet with management to discuss subjects such as artificial intelligence, Airband and cybersecurity.  Next, I head to Vigor Kvichak, a company that designs and constructs high quality aluminum vessels for use on the sea including patrol, search and rescue, firefighting, survey, transporting pilots, transporting passengers and general workboats.  The harbor pilots in Brunswick and Savannah use boats manufactured here and recently my office has been working with the company, pilots and representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on specifications for a new boat. 
Wednesday, August 15, 2018:  I’m in Everett, WA, this morning where I am touring Boeing whose international headquarters are located in Chicago but the bulk of their manufacturing is done here in the Seattle area.  Started in Seattle in 1916 as the Pacific Aero Products Company, the maiden flight of their first aircraft was also that year and today they build everything from 747 ‘jumbo jets’ to 787 Dreamliners.  The company employs almost 40,000 employees here and their assembly plant is the largest building on earth by volume and is large enough to cover Disneyland.  
￼
Rep. Carter touring Boeing 
Their newest plane, the 777x is currently being manufactured and the first delivery is expected in 2020.  Afterwards, I head to Expedia in Bellevue, WA, in the Seattle area. Expedia is a global travel technology group that owns websites such as Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Trivago, Travelocity, and Orbitz.  After a tour of their facilities, I meet with management to discuss cybersecurity and user privacy issues. 
￼
Rep. Carter touring Expedia
Next, I head to the airport for a flight to Vancouver, Canada where I will be participating in The Aspen Institute Congressional Program on Energy Policy Challenges for a Secure North America.  The Aspen Institute is a nonpartisan forum for values-based leadership and the exchange of ideas. Once I arrive at the conference our first speaker is Meghan O’Sullivan from Harvard University who served in the George W. Bush administration.  Her presentation is on “The Global Energy Picture and National Security for the U.S.” She makes a number of good points, stressing the importance of global energy markets being well supplied and encouraging our allies to diversify their own sources of energy.
Thursday, August 16, 2018:  Our first speakers this morning are Kelly Sims Gallagher from Tufts University and Jim Connaughton from Nautilus Data Technologies as they cover the topic of “The Role of Technology and Consumer Choice in Energy Supply and Demand.”  Among the topics that they cover are how the government can best promote technological improvements, how we can invest in research and development and the responsibilities of public and private research. 
￼
Rep. Carter participating in The Aspen Institute Congressional Program on Energy Policy Challenges for a Secure North America
Later in the afternoon, we hear from Robert Bienenfeld, Vice President of American Honda Motor Company and Drew Kodjak, CEO of International Council on Clean Transportation as they discuss the future of the auto industry.  Among the topics that they cover are the move to more electric vehicles, the emergence of autonomous cars and the role that government will play in these areas. Two interesting points that I took away from this session are that fourteen percent of the land in Los Angeles is dedicated to parking and that U.S. national standards will have an impact on Canada as over 40% of their vehicle production is sold in the U.S. 
Friday, August 17, 2018:  This morning we hear from Glen Murray, a former Ontario environment minister and Gitane De Silva, Alberta’s Senior Representative to the U.S., as they present on “Canada’s Approach to Energy Challenges and Implications for the U.S.”  They point out that Canada is in the process of instituting a nationwide price on carbon emissions and, as the largest exporter of oil to the U.S., the impact this could have on the price of Canadian oil.  Later, we hear from Terry Chapin and Gwen Holdmann, both from the University of Alaska on “The Northern Belt and The Arctic and Climate Change.”  Among the many points that they make are the potential impact climate change can have on agriculture, forestry and commerce.  They also discussed the effects of fast warming on the ecological and human environments in the north.  Our final presenter today is Colette Honorable, a former commission member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) as she shares with us her experiences on the commission and how legislators can best interact with the commissioners.  
Saturday, August 18, 2018:  We are very fortunate this morning to hear from Carlos Pascual, former U.S. Ambassador to Mexico and Sergio Marchi, former Canadian Ambassador to the World Trade Organization on “NAFTA’s Impact on Energy Use In The Americas.”  
￼
Rep. Carter with Carlos Pascual, former U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, after his presentation
These two well versed presenters discussed how energy fits into the ongoing discussions of the NAFTA agreement and the importance of energy security for all of North America.  Among the interesting facts that I learned is that the U.S. exports more natural gas to Mexico than all other countries combined and that the U.S. and Canada share the same electrical grid with numerous gas and oil pipelines crossing our international borders.  Later, we hear from Howard Gruenspecht, former Deputy Administrator of the Energy Information Agency and Hal Harvey, CEO of Energy Innovation LLC in California as they present on “Changing Contexts for Energy and Implications for U.S. Policy.”  They discuss the four key consumer demands of reliability, safety, affordability and low pollution and the new technologies that are becoming affordable and, in some cases, cheaper than current technologies.  For instance, solar energy is now 80% less expensive than it was a decade ago and, because of our burdensome regulations, it costs twice as much to put solar panels on a roof in the U.S. than it does in Germany.  Our final speaker of the conference is Ben Fowke, CEO of XCEL Energy, one of the largest public utilities in the U.S. as he offers his insight on “The Future of the U.S. Electricity System.”  In a fine presentation, Mr. Fowke stresses the importance of a reliable, predictable supply of electricity while meeting the goals of affordability, reliability and protecting the environment.

Harold Ortwine: WWII Veteran Receives French Legion of Honor 
On Thursday, I was honored to be in Novi to witness Mr. Harold Ortwine, retired Corporal of the United States Army's 106th Infantry Division, receive the French Legion of Honor distinction by the French Consul, General Guillaume Lacroix.The Legion of Honor is the highest French order of merit for military, and I can think of no person more deserving of this honor than Mr. Ortwine himself, a man who fought on French territory with our allies in 1943 defending liberty in Northern France, Ardennes, Central Europe, and Luxemburg. Mr. Ortwine was drafted at age 18 in 1938 and upon his arrival home in 1945, his discharge papers indicated that he was released from the 104th Infantry Division- which did not fight overseas. However, following a lengthy search for Mr. Ortwine's correct records, my office discovered that he had not received a pair of medals, a World War II Victory Medal and a Medal of Occupation, both of which he was owed. I was pleased to present Mr. Ortwine with these medals last year, over 70 years later. Mr. Ortwine served our country valiantly, and upon his return home, he has continued to serve our community well. Our World War II Veterans have served our nation with selflessness and bravery, and Mr. Ortwine deserves this recognition on behalf of not one, but two grateful nations. As a Michigan native, he is a tribute to our community, and I am proud that he has earned the French Legion of Honor medal. Mr. Ortwine is well-deserving of this recognition of the bravery and heroism he embodied around the world, and I thank him for his service.

Ace Electronics: Celebrating 20 years
On Thursday, I was also pleased to visit Ace Electronics located in Troy to congratulate them on 20 years of commitment to American made products and keeping jobs right here at home. As an engineering based company, Ace has led the way with innovative connectivity solutions for over 20 years. Ace Electronics is a family owned and operated small business, and when Ace opened 20 years ago it had just 3 employees, now with over 30 employees in Michigan they have grown into a national company with offices located around the United States. This Congress we have been committed to helping provide relief for small businesses so that they have the ability to invest in their workers, increase benefits, buy and update new equipment, and continue to create more jobs. In December 2017, the House passed the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act which ensures that American businesses have the resources here at home to invest, hire, and grow. In May 2018, small business optimism hit its highest level in 45 years. By passing these pro-growth policies, Congress is cutting the red tape to help small businesses like Ace continue to produce the best products possible for their consumers. I applaud Ace Electronics for their dedication to providing solutions to cabling issues in a variety of industries around the world, while still creating jobs and products right here in our community.

Ultra Town Hall 
￼ 
I had a wonderful opportunity to participate in a town hall at Ultra Electronics in Lancaster this week. Ultra is an incredible company with hardworking, dedicated employees. They also happen to be working on some remarkable equipment. Ultra makes key components that have to work in really difficult situations. Things like space-hardened machinery, electronic warfare equipment, and next-generation ruggedized controls. 
We had a great discussion about the work they're doing, but also discussed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that President Trump recently signed into law, new career and technical education legislation that helps manufacturers hire and retain skilled workers, and how the new tax reform law is impacting the company and its employees. 
If you'd like to invite me to visit your place of work, school, volunteer organization, or would simply like to set up a time to meet with me in one of my offices, you can send me an email here. 
 
Small Business Optimism
￼ 
Did you know that small business owners' optimism reached a 35-year high in July? Small businesses are setting job creating and hiring records across Pennsylvania and the nation. But the biggest challenge facing small businesses right now is the availability of qualified workers.  I was glad to sit down with small business owners in our community to discuss this concern and talk about what Congress is doing to provide an assist. President Trump recently signed bipartisan legislation I worked on that will help career and technical schools, like Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology, partner will local businesses to help ensure students are prepared for jobs in today's 21st century economy.   I have firsthand experience with the worker shortage. I owned and operated a small construction company for 25 years, and when we wanted to expand our footprint into new markets, we often struggled to find qualified workers. But now more and more small businesses are experiencing this shortage, and Congress is working to address it. I will continue working to repeal onerous regulations and implementing smart policy that helps these businesses expand and create jobs, and helps fill those jobs with well-trained workers. 
 
Entrepreneurial Spirit is Alive and Well 
￼ 
We're all familiar with ride sharing services like Uber. They're convenient and get us where we need to go. But what about the drivers and their motivation behind joining the gig economy? 
This week I sat down with a handful of Uber drivers to hear from them about their experiences with this new sector of our economy that provides workers with flexible hours and their entrepreneurial spirit. You may have seen some of the friendly faces above - or maybe you've received a ride from them!  
 
Bipartisan Problem Solving 
￼ 
As you may know, I'm a member of the Problem Solvers Caucus in the House. This group of lawmakers - about 50 of us - is evenly divided among Republicans and Democrats, and aims to find solutions to the problems we were sent to Washington to solve.
We recently unveiled a package of changes to the way the House operates to make Congress work better for the American people. Our proposed changes reward openness and transparency, encourage a willingness to reach across the aisle, create debate on divisive issues, and empower lawmakers to find real solutions concerning our nation's most pressing issues. 
The LNP Editorial Board recently wrote about this proposal, saying: 
""Our politics is so heated these days. Too many of our elected officials in Washington care more about the political affiliation of a person promoting an idea than the merits of that idea. That's why we've been supportive of the Problem Solvers Caucus.  ""And the fact that there are so many huge problems to solve that aren't being addressed is why we enthusiastically support the ""Break the Gridlock"" proposal."" 
You can watch my 2-minute remarks at our press conference here, and read the full proposal of changes here.

                                                 Dear Friends,   The California State Water Resources Control Board recently proposed a plan to increase unimpaired water flow requirements on the San Joaquin River. Simply put, this would divert even more water away from people in the guise of environmental protection. Touted as a plan to protect “beneficial water use,” this is simply a scheme to grab more water from California cities, farms, and industry. I recently signed a letter with my California congressional colleagues expressing our strong opposition to the plan. You can read the letter here.   Given that California is experiencing another dry water year, it's totally unacceptable for the state to adopt more water supply restrictions. I will continue working with my colleagues in Congress to fight back against actions like these that would further curtail water deliveries to the San Joaquin Valley.   Sincerely,  ￼   Devin Nunes Member of Congress  Pleases note that this account does not accept incoming messages.

 Harvey: One Year Later



Nearly a year later, it’s still difficult to comprehend the scale of Hurricane Harvey’s destruction. While we’ve made good progress rebuilding, we still have work to do. Here are a few key deadlines to be aware of and resources available:
First, many insurance policies have a one-year deadline to file claims. If you have not filed a claim with your insurance for Harvey-related damages, be sure to double-check the deadline with your insurance carrier.
The deadline to demand appraisal of a claim with the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association for those who dispute claim amounts has been extended. Click here for more information from the Texas Department of Insurance.
If you have additional insurance questions, visit the Texas Department of Insurance online or contact TDI by calling 800-252-3439 or emailing ConsumerProtection@tdi.texas.gov.
Rice University has partnered with Fort Bend County, Harris County Public Health Department, Houston Health Department, Montgomery County, and the Environmental Defense Fund to create a Hurricane Harvey Registry. Participating in this brief survey will help these entities better plan for recovery efforts during future natural disasters.
Finally, I have additional resources listed on my Harvey Resource page. We have some rebuilding left to do, but together, we are Texas strong.

Congressman Smith's E-news: August 18, 2018 
  Educating Nebraska’s Youth 
As summer wanes and Nebraska’s young people head back to school, I’m reminded of just how important they are to our nation’s continued growth and stability. Our students of today will be called upon to serve as the leaders of tomorrow, and we must do everything we can to educate and empower them to take on this critical role. Students, however, are graduating college with alarming levels of student loan debt while the probability of securing gainful employment is anything but certain.  The Wall Street Journal recently reported a decrease in the youth unemployment rate, which tracks the number of Americans between 16 and 24 not working or in school, from 9.6 percent in July of 2017 to 9.2 percent in July of 2018. This is great news, as it shows we’re heading in the right direction. But should we be happy when nearly one in ten young people is neither working nor in school? Furthermore, $1.48 trillion in student loan debt is currently outstanding with a delinquency rate (over 90-days late on payments) of over 11 percent.   On August 8th, I convened the first meeting of my Youth Advisory Council for this academic year, comprised of students from across the Third District, including Arapahoe, Auburn, Central City, Gothenburg, Grand Island, Kearney, North Platte, Ogallala, Pierce, Sidney, Valentine, and York. We visited Preferred Popcorn in Chapman to tour their facilities and talk about important issues such as trade with China, the safety of our schools, and how to pay for college.   As always, I encouraged them not to borrow more than they need to pay for tuition and necessities. While I believe everyone should have the opportunity to receive an education, our student loan policies have encouraged both over-borrowing by students and excessive tuition hikes by colleges. I find it troubling many students borrow large sums of money without considering the financial strain of repayment.   I encourage parents to talk to their kids about all available education and employment opportunities. Local schools such as Central Community College offer programs like its Heavy Equipment Operator Technician diploma, which I toured on August 16th. Similar programs cost a fraction of a four-year degree and can offer excellent employment prospects given they fill a specific need.   Scottsbluff High School recently partnered with Aulick Industries to offer its Youth Registered Apprenticeship Program for industrial manufacturing technicians, yet another addition to its newly minted Career Academy and a first for western Nebraska. Grand Island Public Schools offers a number of work-ready programs through its Career Pathways Institute including architecture, welding, finance, and information technology, to name a few.   As you can see, there are many opportunities for young people to expand their horizons while contributing to Nebraska’s economy and building stronger communities. Education is not a one-size-fits-all approach, but a lifelong journey filled with individual choices and exciting opportunities for self-improvement. I’m proud to see Nebraska charting its own course toward better economic opportunity for all.   
Last Week in Photos
It was a busy week with stops in Crawford, Gering, North Platte, Grand Island, Kearney, Hastings, Lexington, Gothenburg, and Ogallala.  
￼  I stopped by Butler Professional Farrier School in Crawford to present them with the 2018 Excellence in Economic Development award  
￼  I hosted a round table in Gering to discuss the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as our ongoing efforts at further simplifying the tax code 
￼  I had a great discussion with residents of Linden Court in North Platte  
￼  I visited the Anson family of Grand Island to present them with the 2018 Excellence in Economic Development Award  
￼  I hosted a second round table on tax reform in Kearney  
￼  I stopped at Central Community College's Hastings campus to learn about their Heavy Equipment Operator Technician program

Combatting the Opioid Crisis Remains a Priority
This week, community leaders and health experts joined me for the second in a series of summits regarding the impact of opioids in the 6th Congressional District. The opioid epidemic is now the deadliest drug overdose crisis in the history of the United States. 
Just released data indicate some progress with opioid overdoses dropping in January. The actions taken by Congress, the work here in Georgia by AG Chris Carr and other leaders, along with a growing awareness of the dangers, are beginning to yield some progress. Still, we have so much more to do to raise awareness, prevent addiction in the first place, build addiction and mental health treatment capacity, and foster long-term recovery. 
Congress has appropriated billions in new dollars and made significant reforms in mental health and addiction treatment. Through these summits, we are gaining a better understanding of the resources that exist here in our community and beginning to identify the gaps. Addiction and mental health experts, nonprofit support groups, local officials, and constituents came together to discuss ways to maximize existing resources and identify areas where more can be done.  
Thank you to each person and panelist who made this summit possible — and thank you to the City of Sandy Springs for hosting us. 
￼ 


Busy Week Across the District
It was a very busy week in the District. Here are just a few highlights from the many activities and events. 

Philips Healthcare Town Hall
Philips Healthcare is one of the 6th District’s largest employers, and I was excited to visit to its Alpharetta campus and meet so many employees. The company leadership gave an overview of the company’s mission and focus. They also provided an up-close assessment of the positive effect of Congress ending the medical device tax. 
Following the briefing, more than 100 employees participated in a town hall with me. I was able to provide an update on my time in Congress, and importantly, answer their questions and hear about the issues on their minds. 
￼ 
Catching Up with Northeast Cobb Businesses
The members of the Northeast Cobb Business Association are fired up about the growth in our economy. When I asked how things were going with their businesses, the room broke out in applause and cheers. Those lower tax rates are definitely making a difference! After sharing a legislative update, I had a nearly 30 minute Q&A session with these great business and education leaders. I also had the chance to talk with a group of future leaders from Lassiter, Walton, and Pope High Schools. Such impressive young people! And, of course, it is always great to be with my friends Cobb Commissioners JoAnn Birrell and Bob Ott. 
￼ 
Health Services for Our Most Vulnerable
It is an incredible opportunity to get a first-hand look at health care services and facilities in our district, especially those that provide care and support to our community’s most vulnerable. At Skyland Trail, those dealing with mental health challenges can receive the care they need to get on the path to wellness. At Mercy Care in Chamblee, I learned more about the impact of Community Health Centers in our district. In addition to its clinic in Chamblee, Mercy Care has several other health centers throughout metro Atlanta. A wide range of health services are provided on a sliding fee, so that those in need can get the care they need...regardless of their income and ability to pay. 
￼ 
A Morning in Brookhaven
Thanks to the Brookhaven Chamber of Commerce for hosting me at its monthly breakfast.  What a great group, and it was so energizing to hear the incredible optimism from the chamber members thanks to lower taxes that are revving up this economy. It was also great to spend time with Brookhaven Mayor John Ernst and Brookhaven Council Members Joe Gebbia, Linley Jones, and Bates Mattison. Brookhaven is a city on the move — thanks to your leadership!

Dear Friend,
As summer fades and fall begins, Missourians prepare to send their children back to school or off to college. Fall brings a fresh opportunity for new starts and the chance to be a little better than last year – whether it’s in the classroom, on the sports team, or in the local community. Many students in Missouri will soon be active in school programs and their communities, but aren’t aware they could receive special recognition from Congress for their achievements and everyday activities....KEEP READING HERE


WHAT'S GREAT IN THE 8TH

￼
Congratulations to the Charleston Fighting Squirrels on their first national championship! They powered their way past Mobile, Alabama and won the Senior Babe Ruth World Series Title this week.
￼
It was great to see so many people turn out for the Missouri State Fair - the place was packed! The agriculture industry is the heart and soul of Missouri and celebrating it at the fair is one of my favorite summer traditions.
￼
Pete Wann from Fredericktown recently took home first place in skeet shooting and fifth in trap shooting at the Scholastic Clay Target Program national competition! It's especially impressive since he just joined the Arnold Junior Shooters six months ago and is on track to qualify for the All-American team. Keep it up Pete!
￼
If your food from the store has a sweet smoky taste to it, there's a good chance it has the flavor of southern Missouri. The good folks at Kerry in Greenville were kind enough to show me how they produce liquid smoke using Missouri products to flavor lunch meats, hot dogs, BBQ sauces and much more. Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, they're investing in new training and plant improvements and increasing production.
￼

I was thrilled to speak to Valley High School's new FFA chapter, an organization that did so much for me growing up. The school district partnered with the local farm bureau and community leaders to create an amazing opportunity - an FFA farm next to the school where any student can learn about the agriculture industry firsthand.

Weekly Update: Better Off Now – Students By Rob Wittman August 18, 2018  Strengthening America’s education system is important in fostering innovation and promoting our economic security. We must be preparing our young people, and providing them with the necessary skills and knowledge to compete in a global economy.  As you may know, one of my top priorities is promoting CTE and STEM programs as a way to cultivate skillsets needed in today’s workforce and connect students with good-paying jobs. That requires supporting local and state career and technical education programs and an increased focus on science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). They work hand in hand. CTE is a catalyst for STEM education. Research indicates that almost half of all STEM jobs require less than a bachelor’s degree. With students facing record education-related debt averaging $37,000, and less than 30 percent of college graduates working in jobs related to their major, CTE offers a great alternative.  Back in March, I had a column published in the Free Lance Star that addresses this exact issue. The good news is that we have been working hard in Congress to bring even more, real change for our students. I was proud to support the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, which is now signed into law. The Perkins CTE program controls over $1 billion in grants for federal, state, and local CTE programs. This bill makes critical reforms that I’ve been advocating for as I visited with students, teachers, school officials, and businesses across the First District. Our reforms include expanding access to CTE programs, helping schools create partnerships with the business community so students can cultivate skills in demand by the labor market, improving and modernizing schools’ CTE programs, and giving states and localities more control over how to spend CTE dollars. 
￼

I have made it my mission to meet with all of the CTE programs in the First District and we have a had a lot of success. In May, I hosted my first CTE Symposium at the University of Mary Washington’s Stafford campus, where teachers, businesses, students, and education officials came together to discuss partnership opportunities and ways Congress can help our students cultivate tangible skill sets. I plan to have two other events just like that in Hanover and Fredericksburg as well, so please stay tuned!

￼

Currently, businesses across America are facing a severe talent shortage due to a lack of vocational education and technical training. President Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a national council designed to reinvigorate America’s workforce. This new council’s mission is to work with the private sector, along with state and local governments, to fill this gap. 

Workforce opportunities in STEM and technical education fields are growing exponentially and jobs related to STEM are expected to rise by more than 9 million through 2022.  It is our responsibility to prepare students for the demands of our current society and to provide unemployed Americans with an outlet to reintegrate into the workforce. I will continue working for what is right for our young people.

SENIOR CITIZENS INFORMATION FAIR I’m hosting a Senior Citizens Information Fair next week at the Claremore Senior Center to allow constituents who have questions or issues with the Social Security Administration to visit with me and members of my staff and get assistance.  A variety of resource organizations will also be in attendance to offer assistance, such as the Social Security Administration, Senior Companion Program, and more. Hope you’ll join us!
Senior Citizens Information Fair Thursday, August 23 9:30 – 11:30am CT Claremore Senior Center 475 E Blue Starr Drive Claremore, OK 74017  
TRAVELING ACROSS OK-2 This week in Oklahoma, I traveled through the southern part of the Second District.
I enjoyed my tour of the Choctaw Headquarters in Durant. We had some great meetings and important dialogue regarding labor issues, health programs, and education among other things. I was glad to be involved in these critical discussions about the progress of the Choctaw Nation.  
￼
Posing for a photo with Choctaw Elders!
 I had a great time touring the CMC Steel Mill in Durant. Dedicated in April of this year, it was one of Oklahoma’s largest building projects. The CMC facility manufactures, recycles and markets steel and metal products, related materials and services through a network of facilities. I’m proud to see an innovative company like CMC putting American jobs first.  
￼
 Thank you to the Durant Economic Development Council for inviting me to your meeting this week. We had some great discussions about areas of economic development necessary for the prosperity of Oklahoma. Projects for new business sites and job creation are on their way!  
￼
I was honored to be a speaker in the Carter Lecture Series at Carl Albert State College in Sallisaw on Tuesday.  We spoke about issues in higher education.  It’s always great to see the future leaders of America getting involved in political discussions.
I wrapped up my week with a meeting with the new hospital administrator of the Northeast Health System in Sequoyah, Stephanie Six.  Stephanie has dedicated 27 years of her life to healthcare.  Congratulations on the new position! 
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS SURPLUS BOOKS PROGRAM The Mannsville School just received a box full of books for their school library through the Library of Congress Surplus Books Program. The Surplus Books Program is open to full-time nonprofit educational institutions such as schools, colleges, museums, and public libraries in order to build library collections. More information about eligible organizations and institutions can be found on the Library’s website at this link.  If you are eligible for the program and are interested in participating, please contact our office at 202-225-2701 or send us an email at this link.  
￼
 NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS MONTH This August has been named National Shooting Sports Month, a time that the country can come together and celebrate all of the benefits we gain from these sports.  Participating in shooting sports not only teaches safe handling of firearms, but it also is a way to practice in a controlled atmosphere.  As a recreational activity, shooting gives us an opportunity to spend time with our family and friends, and to get outdoors and enjoy the fresh Oklahoma air. Read this week’s Mullin It Over about National Shooting Sports Month here.  WEEKLY WRAP-UP It was a great week to be working in Oklahoma. While visiting counties throughout the district, my hope is to motivate you to get involved. Look beyond misleading headlines and gather facts for yourself to make your own informed opinion. Watch the weekly wrap-up on Facebook or YouTube.   
￼
 See more from this past week on my Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr pages and as always, don’t hesitate to contact me if I can help in any way.  
Thank you, ￼

August 18, 2018 
Dear Friends,  It's the summer season, a time when we look forward to relaxing and reconnecting with our friends and family and finding time for fun and enjoyment. But as we celebrate this carefree time of year, it's important for us to remain connected and aware of what is happening at home and around the world.
That is why I would like to share with you my reading picks. These are the articles and op-eds that have captured my interest this week. I believe that the work highlighted here is crucial to remaining well-informed. When each of us does our part to educate ourselves, we are better equipped to make positive contributions that benefit us all. Together, we have the power to make our community, state, and country a place of prosperity and justice for everyone.      Happy reading and all the best,        ￼

America's Best Employers For Women 2018
By Vicky Valet, Forbes
Nine months after the #MeToo movement sent shockwaves through American workplaces, many corporate cultures are slowly starting to react. And while many organizations have struggled to support their female workforces in the range of areas that are important to women—among them pay equity, opportunities for advancement and family leave—others appear to have been getting it right all along.

￼
Forbes partnered with market research company Statista to identify the companies doing just that with our first-ever ranking of America’s best employers for women. To determine the list, Statista surveyed 40,000 Americans, including 25,000 women, working for businesses with at least 1,000 employees. All the surveys were anonymous, allowing participants to openly share their opinions.
Respondents were first asked to rate their organizations on criteria such as working conditions, diversity and how likely they’d be to recommend their employer to others. These responses were reviewed for potential gender gaps. So if women, for example, rated an organization poorly on diversity, but men rated it highly, Statista would take that into account and adjust the company’s score accordingly. Statista then asked female respondents to rate their employers on factors such as parental leave, discrimination and pay equity. These respondents were also asked to nominate organizations in industries outside their own. The final list ranks the 300 employers that both received the most recommendations and boast the most gender diverse boards and executive ranks. (The list contains some companies that may be surprising to some observers. For instance, Google appears on our list in the No. 17 spot, although the company garnered a great deal of negative attention in 2017 with the release of then-software engineer James Damore’s memo about men’s and women’s differing abilities. Google’s ranking reflects the thoughts of its employees.)

Stephen Miller Is an Immigration Hypocrite. I Know Because I’m His Uncle.
￼
If my nephew’s ideas on immigration had been in force a century ago, our family would have been wiped out.
By David S. Glosser, Politico
Let me tell you a story about Stephen Miller and chain migration. 
It begins at the turn of the 20th century, in a dirt-floor shack in the village of Antopol, a shtetl of subsistence farmers in what is now Belarus. Beset by violent anti-Jewish pogroms and forced childhood conscription in the Czar’s army, the patriarch of the shack, Wolf-Leib Glosser, fled a village where his forebears had lived for centuries and took his chances in America. 
He set foot on Ellis Island on January 7, 1903, with $8 to his name. Though fluent in Polish, Russian and Yiddish, he understood no English. An elder son, Nathan, soon followed. By street corner peddling and sweatshop toil, Wolf-Leib and Nathan sent enough money home to pay off debts and buy the immediate family’s passage to America in 1906. That group included young Sam Glosser, who with his family settled in the western Pennsylvania city of Johnstown, a booming coal and steel town that was a magnet for other hardworking immigrants. The Glosser family quickly progressed from selling goods from a horse and wagon to owning a haberdashery in Johnstown run by Nathan and Wolf-Leib to a chain of supermarkets and discount department stores run by my grandfather, Sam, and the next generation of Glossers, including my dad, Izzy. It was big enough to be listed on the AMEX stock exchange and employed thousands of people over time. In the span of some 80 years and five decades, this family emerged from poverty in a hostile country to become a prosperous, educated clan of merchants, scholars, professionals, and, most important, American citizens. 
What does this classically American tale have to do with Stephen Miller? Well, Izzy Glosser is his maternal grandfather, and Stephen’s mother, Miriam, is my sister.

The Raging Dumpster Fire of the President vs. Omarosa
We are yet again reminded of how this president has hired people who reflect and reinforce his nastiness, neediness and narcissism.
By The New York Times Editorial Board
President Trump’s spat with Omarosa Manigault Newman, the White House adviser who was fired in December for “serious integrity issues,” is another of those particularly Trumpian innovations in public life — the raging dumpster fire that continues to yield new trash. 
In her juicy new tell-all, aptly titled “Unhinged,” Ms. Manigault Newman paints an unflattering portrait of the president, whom she has known since appearing as a contestant on his reality TV show “The Apprentice” in 2004. She characterizes Mr. Trump as a racist, misogynistic narcissist with poor impulse control, severe attention-deficit issues and signs of creeping mental decline, who “loves the hate,” “thrives on criticism and insults” and “delights in chaos and confusion.” Her anecdotes range from the prosaically awful (she claims he has used the N-word) to the freakish (she says she once walked into the Oval Office and found him eating paper). She says the Trump campaign offered her a $15,000-a-month sinecure to keep quiet about her on-the-job experiences. (A copy of the agreement has become public.) And, oh yes, she has secret audio recordings to corroborate some of her claims, including a recording of her firing by the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, in the Situation Room. 
Mr. Trump has responded with characteristic restraint. He has dismissed Ms. Manigault Newman as “wacky”; called her a “lowlife”; mocked her for her having, he claims, weepily begged him for a job in the White House; and said she was “hated” by her colleagues for being “nasty,” “vicious, but not smart” and “nothing but problems.” Despite all this, insists Mr. Trump, he had tried his best to make things work because Ms. Manigault Newman always said “GREAT things” about him. For this president, there remains no higher job qualification than constantly telling him and others what a super guy he is. 
On both sides, the spat is vintage Trump: tawdry, cruel, vindictive and highly personal. That said, this is about more than a petty feud with a former aide who famously shares Mr. Trump’s love of chaos, confusion and high drama. It is also a glaring reminder of one of this president’s central failings as a leader: his disastrous judgment when choosing people with whom to surround himself.

Dear Lindsey, 
The past couple of weeks have proven to be very busy, but I wanted to take the time to give you all an update on the recent work in Washington, D.C. and the 15th District of Texas. 
It is an honor to serve as your congressman.
On Thursday, August 2, 2018, I sent a letter to Ivanka Trump, First Daughter and Advisor to the President of the United States, with an invitation to visit the U.S.-Mexico Border, detention facilities, and children and families impacted by the administration’s zero-tolerance policy after her statement that she is “vehemently against family separation,” made earlier today.
I would like to thank Ms. Trump for resonating a message of the need for morality that many Americans publicly expressed. I encourage Ms. Trump to take up this opportunity to witness, first-hand, the effects of the administration’s zero-tolerance policy and the need to rapidly reunite these children with their families.
In June, I extended a similar invitation to First Lady Melania Trump. So far, the First Lady is the only member of the First Family to personally visit and directly address this issue. 
Read the full letter here: 
￼
In response to recent severe storms and flooding, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) are offering recovery assistance to weather-affected Hidalgo County residents. I advise these individuals to not be discouraged, seek out available assistance, and be wary of potential, off-putting rumors. To register for FEMA assistance call 1-800-621-3362 or go online to www.disasterassistance.gov. For more information on local FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers (DRC), click here. See more below: 
￼ 
Need help with a federal agency or department? Now, to better serve residents in need of assistance, Constituent Field Representatives are headed out across the 15th District of Texas for one-on-one neighborhood office hours! From 1:00 – 3:00 p.m. CT, on the first and third Wednesday of every month, at the Dr. Hector P. Garcia Memorial Library in Mercedes, Texas, Constituent Field Representative Karen Hinojosa will be ready and on-hand to provide you with the assistance you need. Keep an eye out for additional upcoming locations, hours, and representatives. More info below:
￼ 
Tuesday, August 14, 2018 marked 83 years since President Franklin D. Roosevelt enacted the Social Security program, which has helped millions of Americans retire comfortably after a lifetime of hard work. Since then, we have honored our promise to protect our elderly and ensure reliable access to the resources and support that they earned.
Unfortunately, one in every five elderly Americans have been victims of financial abuse. Now, more than ever, we cannot abandon our seniors when their resources, and ultimately their independence, are threatened. As a member of Congress, I will continue to stand with our seniors against ill-advised efforts to privatize Social Security and block policies that open the door to financial exploitation.
I am proud to co-sponsor legislation like H.R. 1902, the Social Security 2100 Act, which aims to protect our Social Security system and improve benefits for current and future generations. 
Congress must come together and pass this legislation to allow Social Security to continue to function for the people. The health and well-being of millions of American senior citizens depends on it.

Recently, I took to the House Floor to condemn the inhumane treatment and drugging of immigrant children at the Shiloh Treatment Center near Manvel, Texas. I would like to thank U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee for joining in this fight and for ordering the treatment center to be shut down! Watch my floor speech by clicking the picture below: 
￼ 
Join me in sending Mr. Cayetano Cabrieles, of the 15th District of Texas, best wishes as he continues to celebrate his 100th birthday! Our district Wounded Warrior Fellow, Patrick Roberts, presented an honorary flag and certificate to Mr. Cayetano. Happy birthday!

Weekly Review
 

August 13

The Penny Plan: Given what I’ve said lately on spending, it’s that much more relevant that FreedomWorks has named our Penny Plan their “Bill of the Month” for August. Formally known as the One Percent Spending Reduction Act of 2018, here’s how it works:
Let me start with its simplicity. If you cut a penny a year for the next five years from federal government spending, we end up back at a balanced budget.
I’ve outlined the consequences of doing nothing, which I again believe to be a major financial implosion with dire ramifications for all of us. But in this case, doing something is achievable. Click here to read more.

Effects of Tariffs: I’ve said on more than one occasion that no one wins in a trade war and that ultimately tariffs are taxes that are paid by the taxpayer.
Since this administration’s decision to pursue tariffs, we have seen major companies, like Harley Davidson, shifting production away from the U.S., and Coca-Cola raising its prices due to aluminum tariffs driving up the cost of their cans.
The latest example comes from Winnsboro, South Carolina, where Element Electronics announced it is shuttering its plant there, costing 126 jobs. This was a direct result of tariffs, according to company executives: “the layoff and closure is a result of the new tariffs that were recently and unexpectedly imposed on many goods imported from China, including the key television components used in our assembly operations in Winnsboro.”
As I posted last week, South Carolina is the third-most dependent economy on trade out of all 50 states, and we are the state highest in per capita foreign direct investment of any state in the continental United States. South Carolina has benefited from global trade and investment, but we also face much to lose with the imposition of tariffs.
It's for that reason, that I have cosponsored multiple bills that would allow for congressional oversight of tariff implementation and plan on introducing one of my own in the coming weeks.

Costs of Socialism: “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.” The words are from Daniel Patrick Moynihan, long-time Democrat and a United States Senator from New York for twenty-four years. Moynihan’s words were perceptive and especially relevant today, as there seems to be a growing appetite for socialism. Earlier this week, Gallup reported that for the first time in its polling, a majority of Democrats have a more positive image of socialism (57%) than they do of capitalism (47%).
Indeed, Bernie Sanders, an avowed socialist, was one step away from being the Democratic nominee for president in 2016. And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, recently won a primary over Congressman Joe Crowley, the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives.
But ideas have consequences and the ideas that make up the socialist agenda should be explored. Free college, universal health care, job guarantees, and paid family leave are all policies that may have appeal to voters…but who will pay for these things?
The bottom line is the cost of these policies and the level of taxation required to pay for them would be absurdly high. In just ten years, the total would be $42.5 trillion. For perspective, the government will collect an estimated $44 trillion in revenues over the next ten years. That does not include the current policy baseline deficit of $12.4 trillion over the next ten years.
The taxes that would have to be raised to pay for this? 100 percent of corporate profits and 100 percent of all wage income and pass-through business income above $90, 000 (single) or $150,000 (married) would only raise $34 trillion. A national sales tax of 87 percent would also get you about $34 trillion. An additional 37 percent payroll tax would get you about $34 trillion. That level of spending and taxation is completely unrealistic. That isn’t my opinion; that’s just math.

The American Experiment: Last night was a special night at Alhambra Hall because local parties organized a dinner to celebrate all those who had served in South Carolina’s First Congressional District. It was a fun evening, given I hadn’t seen Henry Brown, Arthur Ravenel, or Tommy Hartnett in a while. Arthur’s comments, as always, were side-splitting.
In my brief remarks, I made two points that are worth reiterating.
One, the night was a celebration of that which our Founding Fathers gave us… a nation of laws and institutions, not men. That in our system, no one is irreplaceable. Office holders would be simple place holders in the passage of time. Some good, some not so good… but the institution could survive both. All of us as office holders are replaceable, and indeed to be replaced based on the genius of the system the Founding Fathers created. Each of the different folks who had served this district had done their part in terms of trying to advance ideas that they had promised to work on - this had been their, and our, contribution - but again, by the Founding Fathers’ design, it was important that we came and did our part for a time and then moved on.
It’s for this reason that I’ve long believed in and advocated for term limits, and every experience I’ve had in elected office has reinforced their importance. Click here to read more.

WHAT OUR SERVICEMEMBERS DESERVE
￼
Our servicemembers risk their lives each and every day to keep America safe. They deserve the tools, training, and support they need to succeed in their missions.
This week, the president signed the bipartisan John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) into law, fulfilling our commitment to America’s heroes.
	•	It invests in a stronger military that is ready to confront any threat and capable of defeating any enemy. 
	•	It provides resources for equipment, maintenance, and training to ensure our servicemembers have what they need to be safe and successful on the battlefield. 
	•	And it gives our troops a much-deserved pay raise – their biggest in nine years.
REBUILDING OUR MILITARY
￼
The United States Military is the greatest fighting force the world has ever known. It is essential that we keep it that way.
With this critical legislation to rebuild our military, we are sending a message of strength, security, and unity.
With new investments in tools, equipment, and training, our Armed Forces will be fully manned and properly equipped to safely and effectively defend our freedom at home and abroad.
The NDAA also enhances missile defense and nuclear deterrence capabilities to counter threats from Iran and North Korea. It strengthens cyberdefense and provides critical resources to confront threats from hostile nations. And it continues support for European allies to deter Russia and provides funding to counter Russian cyber and information warfare threats.
PAY RAISE FOR OUR TROOPS
￼
Our servicemembers and their families deserve the full support we promise them for all the sacrifices they make.
The largest pay raise for our troops in nine years is now official. And we are providing additional assistance to military spouses seeking employment by enhancing the My Career Advancement program.
We also make a promise to take care of our brave men and women in uniform. Part of this law requires a comprehensive review of wounded warrior care and mental health services for them. And it ensures no military medical treatment facility is closed until all facilities are transitioned to the Defense Health Agency.
By rebuilding our military, increasing pay for our troops, and boosting readiness, we are putting the safety and security of the American people first.
As always, it is a privilege to represent 2nd District Hoosiers in Congress.

Dear Friend,  Congressional internships are a great way for students and recent graduates to engage in government. During these internships, they develop professional contacts and gain a better understanding of how our government works, learning first-hand the legislative process and how Congressional offices are run. Responsibilities include assisting staff in a wide variety of tasks including researching issues, attending legislative briefings, helping with administrative tasks, and more.  This fall, my Washington, DC office will be hosting students for full-time and part-time internships. The hours are flexible to accommodate students’ course schedules. If you are interested or know someone who may be interested, more information and the application can be found here.  Better Serving Our Veterans  Recently the Mann-Grandstaff Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Spokane, Washington announced they have extended their hours in order to better serve the veterans in our community and improve their access to the medical care they deserve. The Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center will now be open daily from 7:00 AM until 7:00 PM including weekends and holidays.  Honoring a Local Hero  Staff Sergeant Reymund Rarogal Transfiguracion passed away last weekend after being tragically wounded by an improvised explosive devise while on patrol in Helmand province in Afghanistan. He was bravely serving in his fourth combat deployment. Before deployment Staff Sgt Transfiguracion was based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord here in Washington. He was posthumously awarded a Bronze Star, Purple Heart, and Meritorious Service Medal and was promoted to sergeant first class following his death. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and his military brothers and sisters. Staff Sgt Transfiguracion made the ultimate sacrifice fighting to protect our freedoms. I am incredibly grateful for his dedicated service to our country and for the continued service his military family continues to make every day to protect us.  Bringing Kids and Law Enforcement Together  As Sheriff of King County I had the privilege of starting the Police Athletic/Activities League in our community to help connect kids with local law enforcement officers. I have continued to support PAL as a Member of Congress and recently had the opportunity to meet with kids from across the country and their law enforcement mentors during their visit to Washington, DC for the National PAL Youth Summit. Check out this video they put together about their visit and the great work they are doing for communities around the country. 
￼
Sharing Our Story  I had the privilege of sharing with Congressional staff and other Members of Congress about my time in law enforcement and experience working with my team to catch the Green River Killer. Thank you to the House Library for letting me share our story.

New grants funding in Southwest Michigan



Dear Friend: 
Welcome to your weekly update. As always, you can learn more about these and other legislative issue at my website: upton.house.gov. 
Grant Funded Through Great Lakes Restoration Initiative
I am pleased to announce the Allegan Conservation District was awarded an $180,000 Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) grant by the Great Lakes Commission (GLC).
The Allegan Conservation District Project will encourage the implementation of best management practices to reduce sediment runoff in the Gun River Watershed through a performance-based incentive program.
This is a significant recognition of the Allegan Conservation District’s work to protect the health of our Great Lakes, waterways, and communities. 
This grant will have an immediate, positive impact. For a deeper dive, click here. 
Learn more here about my work to protect the Great Lakes, so that all may enjoy their brilliance and beauty. 
Rural Development Grants 
This week, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced two new investments in the Village of Baroda and Van Buren County totaling $136,000.
These rural development investments will have a positive impact on Southwest Michigan and they will directly help boost our local economy and create jobs.
The first USDA Rural Development grant is for $95,000 for the Village of Baroda in Berrien County to construct a road through an industrial park that would create and/or save at least 20 jobs. To read more, click here. 
The second USDA Rural Development grant is for $41,000 for Van Buren County to complete a comprehensive County-wide Economic Development Plan. To read more, click here. 
Around Southwest Michigan
With no votes in the House until September, I am back in Southwest Michigan for the August District Work Period. 
Already, this week I congratulated participants in final ceremonies for the Maytag IRONMAN, celebrated the hard work of students at the Berrien County Youth Fair, and toured Mol Son in Mattawan to discuss the impact of recent tariffs – just to name a few. 
To stay up to date on my work here at home this summer, follow my Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter pages.
Have a great weekend and God bless,
-Fred

Q&A: Rx Oversight
Q. How will the FDA's recent decision to approve a generic version for the EpiPen help consumers? Q. What are your concerns about proposed mergers in the pharmaceutical supply chains? 
Quick Links
The Food and Drug Administration announced the approval of the first generic version of the EpiPen, an emergency auto-injector of epinephrine used to treat severe, life-threatening allergic reactions. This announcement is great news for millions of Americans who depend on life-saving anti-allergy devices. Affordability often makes the difference for parents purchasing medications or treatments their children need. I’ll continue my work to strengthen competition for prescription medications, hold the government and pharmaceutical companies accountable and increase transparency in drug pricing to make sure Americans are getting a fair shake. 
It is unconscionable to think that our immigration policies may leave bad actors free to exploit and viciously prey on children to get across our border and be released into American communities. I wrote a letter Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen seeking details on a man and 13 year-old girl who were apprehended by Customs and Border Patrol after illegally crossing the southern border. We must repeal the federal restriction on keeping children with adults for longer than 20 days in facilities until parentage may be carefully determined. Until this happens, more children remain vulnerable to sexual abuse and assault.
For many months, we have been aware that foreign actors attempted to interfere in our democracy by spreading false or inflammatory rhetoric to the electorate, and by attempting to hack our electoral systems themselves. That's why I announced a Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism hearing entitled: “Cyber Threats to Our Nation’s Critical Infrastructure.” This will be the seventh full committee or subcommittee hearing held under my leadership on protecting the integrity of U.S. elections. The Senate has a duty to conduct proper oversight to make sure our national security and democracy are not put at risk.
The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court starting on September 4. Judge Kavanaugh is a superbly qualified nominee who understands the difference between a judge and a legislator. He judges based on the facts of the case, the law and the Constitution, without regard to preferred policy or political outcomes. By all accounts, he is a decent man with good character. My committee continues to thoroughly examine Judge Kavanaugh’s record, including his 12 distinguished years on the D.C. circuit court of appeals, using the most transparent process in history. I look forward to his hearing next month when both Republican and Democratic senators will have the opportunity to question him.

Dear  , 
Here with an update on the past week traveling across eastern Connecticut. 
￼
Watch Congressman Courtney and Vietnam veteran Gerry Wright discuss the importance of the Agent Orange Exposure Fairness Act
Agent Orange Exposure Fairness Act 
Last Friday, I had the pleasure of hosting Vietnam Veteran and Agent Orange survivor Gerry Wright in my Norwich office to discuss the brand-new Agent Orange Exposure Fairness Act, a bill I introduced in the House last month with Gerry’s input. The bill addresses a gap in our Veterans’ Affairs system that overlooks some Vietnam and Korean War Veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange during their service and are now living with a serious illness caused by their exposure. The system in place now requires that service members demonstrate that the symptoms of their illness developed within a year of exposure to receive the care and compensation they deserve. The Agent Orange Exposure Fairness Act eliminates these excessive and unfair requirements to include all service members who were exposed to the pesticide, granting them access to the care and benefits they are entitled to. 
Earlier this summer, Gerry rode more than 10,000 miles on his Honda Motorcycle in 6 weeks to raise awareness about this important issue and to advocate for our bill. I commend the tremendous work and efforts of Gerry and other Vietnam veterans have made for this cause, and I remain committed to fighting for the rights of all veterans across our district.

Congressman Courtney joins Santi Rodriguez and his family alongside members of the Connecticut Children's Medical Center community
Fighting to Keep a New London Family Together 
On Tuesday, I joined some of the dedicated members of the Connecticut Children's Medical Center community to stand alongside Santi Rodriguez, a young man facing a life-threatening illness, and his father Julian who is facing deportation, even while his son is receiving treatment. Santi is 14-years old and has been fighting a rare genetic disorder for most of his life. Santi's recovery is due in large part to the incredible work done by his doctors at Connecticut Children’s. This fall he is a rising sophomore at Saint Bernard’s High School in Montville where he loves to play soccer and basketball. 
Santi’s parents fled Colombia in 2000 and sought asylum in the United States in 2002. After being denied asylum, and after filing subsequent appeals that were ultimately denied, Santi’s parents have regularly appeared for mandated check-ins with ICE over the past 9 years. Santi, who was is a U.S. Citizen, was born in this country while his parents sought refuge. Santi requires lifelong care that is highly inaccessible and unaffordable in Colombia and it is critical that Santi has the support of his family as he continues his road towards a healthier future. 
While we all believe that it is important for us to secure our borders and manage legal immigration in a fair way, this young patient’s case makes no sense because on the one hand the government is keeping him alive with cutting edge medical care at the National Institutes of Health, while another agency, ICE, is looking to disrupt that care. His doctors and staff at the Children’s Hospital were adamant that having both parents with their son during these intense regular treatments is essential to his medical care. Any parent with a minor child can instinctively understand how important parental involvement is for a child’s recovery.

Congressman Courtney on the ""Summer Food Rocks!"" Tour with End Hunger CT
Promoting A Summer Meals Program in Norwich with End Hunger Connecticut 
I had the opportunity to join End Hunger CT on Thursday for a tour of the student breakfast and lunch sites across the district where children can access free meals throughout the summer and school year. Behind the scenes of this important work are non-profits and agencies from across Connecticut who are working to meet the food needs in our region. One in six children in our state are considered food insecure, and initiatives like End Hunger help ensure that these kids have access to the nutrition they require to stay healthy, active and focused both in and out of the classroom. 
Our tour began at a community center in Groton adjacent to Navy housing. I met sailors with their children who are enjoying the summer meals program funded the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture. At this visit, and subsequent stops at the Eastern Point Beach recreation program and Ottis Library in Norwich, it was clear that the summer meals program is vital for promoting health and learning. 
It was great to meet the dedicated folks making this initiative possible and witness the quality of excellence that is being served at these sites. Following the tour, I hosted a roundtable discussion with community leaders to discuss the issue of child hunger in Connecticut and the ways we can create broader access to these meal services for kids across our state. As demonstrated by their tremendous work, End Hunger CT is about working families and I remain committed to supporting their mission to keep our children fed, healthy, and ready to learn.

Congressman Courtney announces a federal grant of $250,000 to the New London Fire Department on Thursday
Federal Funding for the New London’s First Responders 
On Thursday, I was very pleased to join Mayor Michael Passero and Fire Chief Henry Kydd, Jr to announce that the New London Fire Department has been awarded a $250,000 federal grant that I have been helping them pursue since 2015. The grant is a part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. Some of the funding will be used to purchase new equipment to decontaminant firefighting gear after being exposed to toxic chemicals during a fire. These containments have been identified as a primary cause of cancer among current and former firefighters and has cost the lives of 12 former New London firefighters. The funding will also be used to enhance operations and safety by providing fighters with advanced Rescue Technician “Core” Program training. 
Additionally, the funding will support much needed improved emergency response equipment, upgrades for emergency response vehicles, and new specialized training programs. I have supported this application and have been working with the Department since 2015 to secure this critical funding. The AFG program supports the health and safety of first responders and provides the necessary tools for departments to successfully execute their public mission.

Congressman Courtney visiting Perception Programs in Willimantic
Recognizing the Importance of Non-Profits in Our Region 
Today on National Non-Profit Day, working to treat substance use disorders and provide mental health services. We began at Perception Programs, a treatment clinic in Willimantic, whose mission is to reduce clients’ at-risk behaviors and promote their safety, employment, and mental wellbeing. 
We then visited Reliance Health at their new facility in Norwich. Reliance, a behavioral health center, supports over 30 programs in several areas and is focused on outpatient and supported living facilities. 
We ended our nonprofit tour in New London at Sound Community Services. SCS does great work in supporting several out-patient, intensive outpatient, and residential service programs-- included medicated assisted treatment. 
I hope you enjoyed this snapshot of my work, and as always thank you for taking a moment to read my weekly update. If you have any questions or concerns about the information in this newsletter, you can contact me through my website or by calling my Norwich district office at 860-886-0139.

This Week in Review
￼￼￼
 
Hello Friends,   This week sure was a busy one! During my visit with the Scottsdale Rotary Club we discussed the 2026 fiscal year budget and how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has positively affected Arizona jobs and household income. Rotary Club members also brought up topics to include Medicare, our immigration system and border security. It was great to get a chance to discuss topics that don't over lap, I thank them for inviting me to speak.     ￼￼￼
 One of the highlights of my week included meeting the Saguaro High School Robotics Club to see all of their hard work and gadgets. I am now wishing when I attended Saguaro High School I could have been a part of the Robotics Club!  It was great to bond over a mutual fascination with technology, while hearing about all of the impressive projects they are working on. It was an honor to meet with these bright students and I look forward to visiting with them again soon! 
￼￼
Office appointments with constituent groups have continued to bring new ideas to the table. This week I have had the chance to discuss topics including Arizona droughts, healthcare, and pension reform. Being on the Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multi-Employer Pensions, I have dedicated a large portion of this summer into researching and hearing from stakeholders on this very important topic. I encourage you to look at www.pensions.senate.gov for more details on the committee's actions or if you as a stakeholder would like to submit input please email jscsmpp@finance.senate.gov.

Carper's Connection
August 17, 2018 
Dear Friend,
This week, my colleague Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, and I released an important report. Despite our different political affiliations, we came together to examine what the Trump Administration is doing to protect unaccompanied minors — migrant children who arrive at our border without guardians — who are living in our country. Unfortunately, the answers we found were not reassuring. 
￼
This isn’t the first time Senator Portman and I have teamed up to tackle this issue. Back in April, we held a hearing with the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to review the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) efforts to protect unaccompanied minors from human trafficking and abuse. As the top Democrat on this bipartisan subcommittee, I work closely with Senator Portman to investigate a wide variety of matters that we decide deserve a closer look at Congress. Together, we are given the privilege and broad authority to ask tough questions that no one else is asking.  
During our April hearing, we did just that. We heard troubling reports from a Sussex County school counselor detailing the difficulty of unaccompanied youth children adjusting to school and the high rates of mental emotional trauma associated with migrant children. We also heard reports of children being placed in homes with people they don’t know who expect them to work to help with living expenses; we heard about children, sometimes due to a need to send money home or to pay debts to smugglers, working all night and unable to stay awake at school during the day. To top things off, it was during this time that HHS informed us that they had actually lost track of about 1,500 children who were placed in their care. Dozens more ran away from home or were found to have moved in with someone not vetted by HHS at all. To say this is unacceptable would be a gross understatement. 
￼
But, despite our warnings this past spring, officials at HHS and DHS are still not doing enough. While the administration has made incremental progress in some areas, not nearly enough is being done to ensure that children living in this country are protected from abuse. In fact, President Trump has taken steps that not only hindered our progress, but needlessly inflicted trauma on thousands of children. Their cruel “zero-tolerance” policy separated parents from their children at our border and created 2,500 new unaccompanied children for HHS to care for.   
Yesterday, I once again demanded answers on what this administration is doing to protect this vulnerable population, because we have a moral responsibility to ensure that these migrant children fleeing their homes and extreme violence are safely and responsibly guided through the immigration process. In the absence of leadership from the administration, I believe Congress must now come forward with legislation that would ensure we’re living up to our most basic responsibilities to the vulnerable children coming to us for help. Together, we can look for inspiration in people like Laura Graham, Deputy Director and Managing Attorney of the immigration and Medical-Legal Partnership Programs at Community Legal Aid Society Inc. in Delaware. As a legal advocate, Laura helps unaccompanied children navigate the complex requirements of our immigration process.  
Resolving these issues not only requires policy changes from DHS and HHS, but reminds us of the need to address the root cause of the problem: extreme poverty and unspeakable violence in countries like the Northern Triangle — Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Over the years, I’ve visited these places, met with their leaders and seen firsthand how communities there are struggling to deal with challenges that would be unimaginable to most Americans. As long as these challenges go unaddressed, migrants will continue to make the dangerous trek to our southern border in search of refuge.  
When we look to address the complexities of our immigration process, we cannot forget the teachings of Matthew 25: “I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave me drink; I was a stranger in your land and you welcomed me.” Thus far, this administration’s treatment of those arriving here seeking refuge have failed on that most basic measure. You have my commitment to keep fighting for policies that do right by these children, their families, and our shared American ideals.

8/17/18 19:16,Congressman Young’s August Update,"August Update | August 17, 2018
 

￼ 
Dear friends,
Summertime is always busy in Washington, D.C. and before I came home for the district work period this month, Congress was busy passing important legislation for both Alaska and the nation. The House passed my bill to reauthorize the Magnuson-Stevens Act for the first time in over a decade, I voted to help end the opioid epidemic through increased treatment and recovery as well as prevention efforts and President Trump signed the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) into law. This year’s NDAA, which I worked to fight for Alaska focused provisions, will provide for a historic rebuilding of our military, a pay raise for our troops and deliver much needed reform at the VA so our veterans can receive better care. 
Those are just to name a few of big ticket items I worked on this summer. My job as your representative is to take the ideas you share with me and translate them into policy solutions in D.C. One of the best ways I can do this is to come home and meet with Alaskans from different backgrounds and different areas. Throughout the year, I have been coming home and traveling across our great state to meet with people face-to-face about the issues they are dealing with on a daily basis. August is one of my favorite months because the days are long in Alaska and I get to spend an extended amount of time in our great state. 
As you may have seen, I have been traveling throughout the state to meet with people in small and large communities alike. Lots of ferries, planes and miles driven have made this travel possible as I started the month traveling across Southeast Alaska.
Ketchikan
I started off the visit through Southeast in Ketchikan and got off the ferry to enjoy the great weather and meetings. I met with the city officials to discuss the dock expansion they’re working on and how influential tourism has been in this area.
￼
After walking around, we met with veterans over at the local Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) for hamburger night to share a meal and visit with Alaskans. I got to hear their stories about their time defending our country and discuss the importance of ensuring our military has access to resources to continue protecting our freedoms. 
￼
I visited with Alaskans at Hamburger Night at the VFW in Ketchikan.

I spoke with many local residents who shared their concerns about ensuring the local economy is able to stay active and diversified which is crucial for the area since the loss of the timber industry. We discussed the recent land transfer around Swan Lake I helped facilitate in Congress which will directly benefit this community to allow for more hydroelectric power. In the House version of the 2018 Farm Bill, I was able to secure a crucial amendment that would repeal the Clinton-era Roadless Rule which led to a detrimental economic decline for many Southeast Alaska communities. These are just some of ways in which I’m working to reinvigorate the economy in Southeast Alaska.
Wrangell
After a six hour ferry ride from Ketchikan to Wrangell, we got straight to work. I met with Alaskans at the famous Stikine Inn to give them an update on the issues I’m working on in D.C. and then sat down to hear from them. We discussed a range issues from MSA reauthorization to the Roadless Rule to health care reform and what we’ve done this Congress to address many of their concerns. 
￼
Click here to watch the video from my visit to Wrangell.
After a great night in Wrangell, I joined the new city manager, the Mayor of Wrangell and assembly members to hear from them about local projects they are working on and we had a productive discussion about the completed projects and future projects that will improve the community. I was pleased to learn about many of the water and sewer and infrastructure projects these local leaders are working together to accomplish for residents. We also discussed the potential of hydropower so the area can have a reliable source of energy to power their lives. It was very encouraging to see such dedicated and focused leadership from these local Alaskans. 
Before we made our way to the airport to head to Sitka, we met with the Wrangell Cooperative Association to discuss Alaska Native issues on the island. Many of the outreach and community building activities the tribe is working on at this time revolve around being good stewards of the land and continuing to improve infrastructure for Wrangell. We discussed many of the important opportunities for this tribe to partner with the federal government to further empower the tribe. 
Sitka 
On our short flight from Wrangell over to Sitka, we got a breathtaking aerial view of Southeast again. I had a great visit in Sitka visiting with the Mayor and local officials to discuss projects they're working on and how I can continue to help this Southeast community. Investing in the hydropower and water infrastructure projects is crucial for this region as local officials reiterated. Another topic of discussion revolved around ensuring the community has a variety of industries to help foster population growth and education. 
￼

I met with SheeAtika to discuss the projects they are working on and how important the expansion of the 477 program has been for Alaska Natives. I was able to get a community update and discuss other projects they are working on in and around Sitka. 
Juneau
As all Alaskans know, the only way to arrive into the state’s capital is by air or ferry and on this visit we flew in and left on the Alaska Marine Highway. The visit to Juneau was very productive and again, we enjoyed wonderful weather. 
The Central Council of Tlingt and Haida invited me to speak at their Alaska Native Issues Luncheon where I was able to share a quick update about what’s happening in Washington and  more importantly, engaged in a great question and answer session about many tribal topics.

Afterwards, I met with Mayor Ken Koelsch for a quick update on what projects the city is working on and walk around to see many of these efforts and visit with local business owners. 
￼
Mayor Koelsch and I walked around downtown Juneau.
Skagway
After our ferry ride from Juneau, we arrived in Skagway where I met with Mayor Monica Carlson to get an update on local projects they are working on and what federal assistance we can collaborate on for the city.
￼
Click here to watch the video from my visit to Skagway.
 Afterwards, I visited the newly built police and fire station to hear how they're using their resources to combat the opioid crisis and keep the community safe. Before making our way to Haines, we got a ride on the White Pass and Yukon Route Railroad to see more of Skagway and visit with the employees.
Haines
After a great trip to Skagway, we took the ferry over to Haines. I love the ferry system in Alaska because it gives me a chance to visit with Alaskans and see more of the Last Frontier. On the visit, I had the opportunity to meet with Alaskans from many different backgrounds and hear directly from them so I can continue to help communities like Haines. 
￼
Click here to watch the video from my visit to Haines.
I met with from leaders within in the Chilkoot Indian Association, heard from veterans at the American Legion, visited the village of Klukwan and toured the Palmer project. I also met with Mayor Jan Hill so she could show me recently completed projects in the borough. Mayor Hill gave me an update on many of the major projects the borough is working on and how I can assist this community at the federal level so they can continue to grow their local economy.
Kodiak and Old Harbor
I joined the U.S. Coast Guard Alaska and U.S. Marine Corps to see the Innovative Readiness Training (IRT) they are doing together in Old Harbor. The IRT Old Harbor project is part of a civil and joint military program to improve military readiness while simultaneously providing quality services to communities across the nation. The IRT program began in 1992 when the Department of Defense searched for innovative programs to serve American communities in need and provide realistic military training benefits. The three primary areas of emphasis were health care, infrastructure support and youth training areas.
One of the primary projects they have been working on was the extension and expansion of the Old Harbor airport runway, which was officially unveiled today. I'm proud of the work that went into completing this project and for the economic prosperity it will be bring to the area. This partnership and collaboration represents the importance of our military working both overseas and right here in our own backyard.

 Old Harbor is a small community on Kodiak Island and highly dependent on the fishing industry. In order to support economic expansion, the Old Harbor Native Corporation, the City of Old Harbor and the Old Harbor Tribal Council have been working to establish infrastructure needed to start a fish processing operation in the community. The expansion of this runway is crucial to the economic revitalization of the island.  
￼
Rafael and his mother and two sisters attended the Medal presentation.
After arriving back at the Coast Guard base in Kodiak, I had the opportunity to present Kodiak High School senior Rafael Bitanga with the Silver Medal he received for the Congressional Award. Rafael earned the Congressional Award for his commitment to improving Kodiak through more than 400 hours of community service.  
Over the course of the first two weeks of this August district work period, I traveled to eight different communities throughout Alaska and I haven’t slowed down since. To see more of my travels, make sure to follow my Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts to stay up-to-date.
Stay tuned for part two of my August travels through our great state!
 
God Bless,

The Week Just Past: The Recovery Begins Our Work to Improve Services and Benefits for our Veterans The Fight to End Modern Day Slavery Salute: BG Sean Mulholland  Salute: a fond farewell to Rockaway Township Mayor Michael Dachisen
The Week Just Past: The Recovery Begins
Last Saturday, residents of Little Falls and Woodland Park faced catastrophe when torrential downpours led to major flooding in the Peckman River in a matter of minutes.  The flood waters have left behind incredible destruction and terrible heartache for families and small businessmen and women.
I would like to thank all the first responders, emergency managers, public works departments and local, county and state officials who responded to help those threatened by the devastating waters. Without their quick and professional actions the damage could have been much worse.
Clearly, a solution is desperately needed to reduce the impact of this flooding on the individuals who are forced to live with its dire consequences. On Tuesday, I wrote the Army Corps of Engineers, again, urging for an expedited solution that will address the flooding in the Peckman. 
Of course, I will continue to work with local, state and federal partners to assist residents with resources, information and support. Please do not hesitate to call my Morristown office (973-984-0711) for assistance.
Our Work to Improve Services and Benefits for our Veterans
As a Vietnam Veteran, one of my top priorities is ensuring the men and women who served our nation, on and off the battlefield, receive world class healthcare and benefits they have earned. The 115th Congress has worked to pass numerous bills that reform the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), ensuring they are delivering benefits and care to those who served.  
Prior to the start of the August District Work period, the House of Representatives continued its important work to increase benefits and support to our nation’s heroes by approving another nine bipartisan veterans bills. These measures would improve servicemembers’ transition into civilian life, provide financial assistance for veterans who choose to live in medical foster homes, increase educational and economic opportunities for veterans and more.
To date, the House has sent more than 70 bills to the Senate for their consideration, and we have had over two dozen bipartisan, bicameral bills signed into law.
In addition, the House Committee on Appropriations has ensured the VA has the necessary resources to fulfill our commitment to our veterans. The Fiscal Year 2019 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill, which was approved by the Committee and passed the House of Representatives in June, provides an almost  5% increase in funding from FY 2018 levels-- the largest dollar amount in history to the VA.
During the week of July 23rd, with my support, the House gave bipartisan approval to the following bills:
H.R. 2409, to allow certain servicemembers to terminate their cable, satellite television and internet access service contracts while deployed, would extend existing federal protections to cable and satellite television services under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. Under this legislation, servicemembers would only need to provide notice and a copy of their active duty orders to cable and satellite providers to terminate their contracts without penalty.
H.R. 2787, the VET MD Act, would direct the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to carry out a three year pilot program beginning no later than August 15, 2020, in at least five regionally diverse VA medical centers to provide undergraduate students a clinical observation experience within VA.
H.R. 5538, The Reserve Component Vocational Rehabilitation Parity Act, would add eligibility for Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) for active service under certain reserve orders.
H.R. 5649, the Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William “Bill” Mulder (Ret.) Transition Improvements Act of 2018, would make improvements to the Transition Assistance Program and the overall transition process for servicemembers to include more of a focus on career opportunities and entrepreneurship.
H.R. 5864, The VA HELP Act, requires VA to establish qualification standards and performance metrics for VHA HR positions and provide a report to Congress containing such standards and metrics.
H.R. 5882, The Gold Star Spouses Leasing Relief Act, would allow surviving spouses to terminate residential leases at the time of a servicemember's death without penalty.
H.R. 5938, the Veterans Serving Veterans Act, would require VA to identify specialties that correlate with open positions within VA, to coordinate with DoD to identify soon-to-be-separated servicemembers and to add those servicemembers’ specialties and contact information to VA’s recruiting.
H.R. 5974, the VA COST SAVINGS Act, would require VA to identify facilities that would benefit from cost savings associated with the use of an on-site regulated medical waste treatment system over a five year period.
H.R. 5693, Long-Term Care Veterans Choice Act would authorize VA, during a three-year period beginning on October 1, 2019, to transfer upon request up to 900 veterans for whom the VA is required to provide nursing home care to a medical foster home that meets VA standards.
The Fight to End Modern Day Slavery 
Congress has taken a number of critical steps to fight the scourge of human trafficking. Unfortunately, human trafficking is a growing enterprise that affects individuals across the world, including here in the United States and New Jersey, and is regarded as one of the most pressing human rights issues of our time.
During this Congress, the House has led the fight to end human trafficking by passing dozens of bills designed to protect children and combat this growing problem – providing support and services to the victims of this crime and boosting resources for law enforcement. 
I was pleased to support the following bills as they passed Congress and were signed into law by the President:
	•	Department of Homeland Security Blue Campaign Authorization Act, which helps protect victims of human trafficking by providing the right tools to federal, state, and local law enforcement, as well as private sector organizations to increase awareness and better defend against this heinous threat.
	•	No Human Trafficking on Our Roads Act,  which prohibits individuals from operating a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) for their lifetime if they used a CMV to commit a felony involving human trafficking.
	•	Combating Human Trafficking in Commercial Vehicles Act, which seeks to promote outreach and education to prevent human trafficking on our highways.
	•	Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, which combats online sex trafficking by providing new tools to law enforcement through a new federal criminal statute and by making it easier for states to prosecute criminal actor websites.
As a result of this legislation, online advertising for commercial sex trafficking has gone down by 60-80%.
Even with this progress, our work is not done. At its root, combating this scourge takes the increased awareness of every citizen. Speaking up is the most effective way to protect and support the victims and their families.
If someone you know is being trafficked or human trafficking is happening in your community please contact the National Human Trafficking Hotline here or you can call 24/7 at 1-888-373-7888 or text 233733.
To learn more about the signs and red flags of human trafficking please visit here.
Salute: BG Sean Mulholland 
It is with a heavy heart I learned of the passing of Army Special Forces Brigadier General Sean Mulholland.  Raised in Montville and a graduate of Morris Catholic High School in Denville, General Mulholland was a dedicated warrior and devoted family man, who served our nation with distinction for over 30 years. I was honored to know Sean and call him a friend-- he was truly a “Fighting Mulholland”!  Sean will certainly be missed, but his impact on and off the battlefield and his service to defend our nation will be long-remembered.
You can read more about Sean’s career in the Army and his numerous tours and assignments with the Special Forces here.
Salute: a fond farewell to Rockaway Township Mayor Michael Dachisen, a lifetime resident of the Township who passed away suddenly this week.  Throughout his life Mike always put others before himself, especially during his tenure on the Township Council for 15 years and as mayor for the last 6 years.
Mayor Dachisen was a strong supporter of Picatinny Arsenal and the work of thousands of men and women who support our war fighters every day.  Mike hosted our Picatinny Working Group in his municipal building for our regular meetings and was a gracious and well informed member!
It was clear his love for Rockaway was only outmatched by his love for his family.  He will be missed.  You can read more about Mayor Dachisen here.

8/17/18 19:05,ICYMI: Bergman Sends Letter Urging President Trump to Approve Governor Snyder's Individual Assistance Appeal,"  
￼

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  August 17, 2018
CONTACT: James Hogge 231-640-9158

ICYMI: Rep, Jack Bergman Sends Letter Urging President Trump to Approve Governor Snyder's Individual Assistance Appeal

Houghton - Following Governor Rick Snyder's appeal for Federal Individual Assistance after the Father's Day floods, Congressman Jack Bergman sent the below letter to President Donald Trump:

Dear Mr. President:
I write in support of Governor Rick Snyder’s Individual Assistance appeal for those affected by the June 16-18 mud-slides and storm damage in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  I am deeply appreciative that your Administration has approved the Public Assistance request for Houghton, Menominee, and Gogebic Counties and for the quick response by federal agencies to work hand in hand with the state and local officials. However, there is still much work left to be done. When I arrived in Houghton less than 48 hours after the initial storm damage occurred, I was encouraged by the determination and will of the communities. Neighbors joined hand in hand to help neighbors who had lost everything in the overnight storms. The immediate relief efforts by local and state authorities, first responders, road crews, and volunteers has been remarkable. 
On August 10, I returned to Houghton for the third time since the storm damage occurred, to meet with local residents and officials. As highlighted in the Governors appeal, the need for Individual Assistance is still very important, and with the winter months quickly approaching, it’s imperative this assistance is received in a timely manner.
The evidence of damage in the affected counties has been made clear by the granting of Public Assistance and while that will go a long way in helping us rebuild critical infrastructure, I remain concerned about the initial denial for Individual Assistance. It is my hope that you consider Governor Snyder’s appeal of that denial, and continue your Administration’s efforts to help Michigan’s First District recover.

August 17, 2018 
Dear friend,  This week I brought U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue to our community to discuss the impacts of Sacramento’s water grab and increasing tariffs on Central Valley agriculture. We held a town hall with Rep. Jim Costa (D-Fresno) in Modesto, where local stakeholders and growers addressed us directly about these critical issues. The Secretary and I also visited Brichetto Ranch on the Stanislaus River in Oakdale to see the importance of this water to our ag community firsthand. I wanted him to see for himself the devastation Sacramento’s Bay Delta plan would cause to the Valley’s way of life. I am happy to have secured his commitment to help us fight the State’s reckless attempt to flush away millions of gallons of our water.  I have been leading the fight to protect our Central Valley water rights while improving water infrastructure and storage. Water is the lifeblood of our community; residents deserve to know that their supply of drinking water will be safe, clean, and plentiful for generations to come. We are California’s breadbasket, and farmers need access to water resources in order to grow a vibrant economy and continue feeding the United States. I recently passed legislation to protect these vital resources by including two amendments to the Department of the Interior funding bill. The first prevents any water from the New Melones Reservoir from being used in the State’s Bay Delta Plan, effectively preventing it from moving forward. The second expands access to federal loans for local water districts to develop new critical water infrastructure.  I look forward to a continued partnership with Secretary Perdue, and I thank him for taking the time to visit our local community and hear directly from our farmers. 
￼
Productive new ideas to combat human trafficking at community roundtable Human trafficking is a scourge plaguing our communities. A single person affected by human trafficking is too many, and we need to to combat this problem with every resource at our disposal. More human trafficking goes through California than any other state, with the vast majority of traffickers targeting young girls between the ages of 14 and 25. That is why I hosted a roundtable with Stanislaus County District 1 Supervisor Kristin Olsen at the Modesto Police Department. Uber Technologies Inc., along with our local law enforcement, community leaders, and advocacy groups all joined the roundtable, which had to be moved into a larger room to accommodate all the attendees. It was encouraging to see so many in our community come together to help combat this abhorrent crime.  Our conversation brought a number of new ideas to the forefront, including a pledge from Uber representative Dave Barmore to work with our communities to train Uber drivers to look for “red flags” of sex trafficking in our community.  In Congress, I recently supported two bills from the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee that target traffickers using our road systems to support their crimes, and a third bill that increases liability for online platforms allowing human traffickers to use their websites. All three have been signed into law. With continued hard work, and innovative ideas we can put an end to these attack on our families and community.  Working with Patterson High school to encourage promising new careers in trucking I was happy to be welcomed by Patterson High School for a tour of their Trucking Program, one of the first in the nation, on Thursday. The trucking industry faces a shortage of commercial drivers as the workforce continues to age and demand for more transportation increases. A study conducted by the American Trucking Association concluded that by 2024, 175,000 new drivers would be needed to meet demand. It is exciting to see local educators turn what many perceive as a problem into an opportunity. Patterson students now have the opportunity to address this industry need while acquiring knowledge and experience necessary for a bright future. The program provides career development and higher education opportunities, in addition to helping students acquire necessary licensing. In our rapidly changing economy, career development for young people is more important than ever. Programs like these are key in closing the growing skills gap, while giving all Americans the ch! ance to prosper. I will continue to work in Congress to expand these opportunities, pushing innovative solutions that help bring our young people into the workforce.

The Senate Should Pass the STOP Act without Delay
A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed that drug overdoses killed more than 72,300 Americans last year, a surge of roughly 10% from the previous year. Much of the uptick has been attributed to the fact that these drugs are becoming stronger, and thus, more dangerous. Synthetic drugs such as fentanyl are multiple times stronger than heroin but are similar in appearance, which makes it harder to differentiate on the street.
Last month, the House passed a comprehensive opioids package that included the STOP Act – bipartisan legislation I championed that would help mitigate the shipment of synthetic drugs through our country’s borders. The STOP Act is a key component of the strategy to combat these synthetic drugs. It is now time for the Senate to pass this critically needed legislation and send it to the President’s desk. Together, we can combat the opioid crisis and help those suffering to recover. With the STOP Act, we can reduce the threat of synthetic opioids by stopping them before they reach our communities.
Learn more about the STOP Act and how it can stem a portion of the opioid crisis: https://faso.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1223

FDA Approves New Generic Epinephrine Auto-Injector, Expanding Access and Lowering Costs
Earlier this year, I was alerted to a shortage of epinephrine auto-injectors in New York State’s Hudson Valley and Catskill regions. In response, I wrote a letter to U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb asking what steps would be taken to expand access to generic auto-injectors, lower costs for American consumers, and prevent future shortages in the U.S. market. At the time, the FDA had just added epinephrine auto-injectors to the FDA’s list of existing drug shortages.
This week, the FDA announced that they have approved a new generic epinephrine auto-injector. I’m glad to see the FDA approve additional effective and safe devices. This will allow costs to decrease for consumers as well as provide greater access to these life-saving tools that are critical for so many people in Upstate New York who suffer from serious allergic reactions.
Read more on the approval process and how the new generic version can fundamentally change the market for this device: https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/16/health/generic-epipen-fda-approval-bn/index.html.

Overseas Producers Market Fraudulent Products, Hurting Authentic Organics Products and Consumers
As the organic industry continues to grow, overseas producers are increasingly introducing fraudulent products into the market moonlighting as authentically organic. Fraudulent products hurt legitimate and hardworking organic producers here in Upstate New York as well as the consumers who expect a certain standard. I’ve introduced legislation to crack down on these fraudulent products by increasing enforcement at the USDA.
Read: ‘Dirty Feed, Done Dirt Cheap: Are Consumers Who Shell Out for Organic Meat Eating a Bunch of Bull?’ to learn more about the problem and my bill to crack down on fraudulent organic products: https://www.ecowatch.com/are-consumers-who-shell-out-for-organic-meat-eating-a-bunch-of-bull-2594493480.html.

Changes in China’s Recycling Policy Hits Pocketbooks Here at Home
Restrictive changes to recycling policies in China are being felt throughout our Upstate New York communities. It is now more difficult and costly for local municipalities to find buyers for recyclable materials, which is causing an increase in trash collection rates. In Rensselaer County, fees will have to be increased in order to compensate for the increased costs caused by China’s changes.
Last month, I urged U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to intervene with Chinese officials. It is my hope that we can resolve this issue and prevent fee increases from becoming commonplace.

National Defense Authorization Act Signed into Law
This year’s National Defense Authorization Act continues our efforts to significantly improve the nation’s military readiness while also equipping our warfighters with the tools they need to succeed on the battlefield. Last year, eighty members of the military died as a result of non-combat training-related accidents, nearly four times more than the number of troops who have died in combat. According to the Air Force, only 71% of Air Force aircraft were mission-capable at any given time during fiscal year 2017. This is unacceptable.   Efficiently rebuilding the military has been one of my biggest priorities. I was proud to vote for this widely bipartisan bill which also contains the largest pay increase for our troops in the past decade. It continues this Congress’ commitment to the men and women who sacrifice daily to keep us safe.

Veterans Resource Fair in Schoharie County
We had a great turn out at the Veterans Resource Fair at the Schoharie County Sunshine Fair. The purpose of these events is to give veterans a convenient place to inquire about the benefits they have earned. This particular fair brought together representatives from the Schoharie County Veterans' Services Office and the Stratton VA Medical Center to provide veterans with resources and guidance on the benefits that they have earned.
Veterans and those with friends or family who are veterans should contact one of my offices if they ever need assistance with the Department of Veterans Affairs, have questions about benefits, or need assistance with other casework issues: faso.house.gov.
￼

Ulster Co. Stand-Down
The Ulster Co. Veterans Stand-Down also brings together veterans service organizations and providers to help our veterans. The event was organized by the Ulster Co. Veterans Services Office and gave local veterans a chance to network, learn more about benefits, and the event even provided access to military surplus clothing for those that are in need.  
This is a tremendous event that positively contributes to the lives of veterans in Ulster County and those in surrounding areas. It was a pleasure to attend and offer assistance to veterans who may have casework concerns that my office can assist with moving forward.

Keel Laid for Future USS Cooperstown
The keel, the bottom most structure of the hull of a ship, for the future USS Cooperstown was laid and authenticated this week by the Mayor of Cooperstown, Ellen R. Tillapaugh. The USS Cooperstown will be the U.S. Navy’s 23rd Littoral Combat Ship, which is a highly maneuverable and adaptable vessel that has evolved in capabilities over the years.
The ship is being named the USS Cooperstown to honor the veterans who are members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Sixty-four members enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame served in conflicts ranging from the Civil War through the Korean War. 
Read more about the ship and its capabilities here: https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/team-freedom-lays-keel-on-nations-23rd-littoral-combat-ship-2018-08-14.

Powassan Virus Diagnosed in Dutchess Co.
A case of Powassan virus has now been diagnosed in Dutchess Co., in addition to Columbia Co. earlier this summer. This rare, but dangerous, tick-borne condition can be transmitted from the tick in as little as 15 minutes. Stay diligent and always be checking for ticks on clothes and skin.

Examining Whaley Lake Dam with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
The Whaley Lake Dam was originally built in the mid-1800s and is in critical need of repair. The outlet of the dam feeds a stream necessary to the movement of treated wastewater from multiple municipal water treatment facilities. Additionally, the town of Pawling is home to 9,000 residents, including 500 homes located on Whaley Lake.
Yesterday, I hosted a visit at Whaley Lake Dam with an official with the Army Corps of Engineers and local officials, including Supervisor James Schmidt. The Corps was able to check on progress of the site and offer technical assistance moving forward.

Bard College Programs Earn Grant Funding for Work in the Humanities
Bard College is home to incredible scholars whose work will help define history for generations to come. Two projects at Bard recently received competitive grant funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities. These grants are awarded through a competitive process with peer review to ensure they represent high-quality public engagement.
These NEH grants recognize the talent working at Bard, and the tremendous leadership that the school displays in the academic arena. This type of scholarly research into classic historical events and times helps us gain insight into the past and reminds us of our shared human experience. I’m glad to see the National Endowment for the Humanities has recognized that fact and awarded these projects with funding.

Visit to Pawling Corporation
Pawling Corporation started with fifteen employees in the 1940’s making gaskets for ammunition cases for the military. I visited their Wassaic facility to learn more about the high-tech doors and barriers they are making today for hospitals and labs. Notably, the company is producing doors that are watertight and airtight to protect medical facilities.

Learning about the Anderson Center for Autism
The Anderson Center for Autism in Staatsburg is a residential school that serves over 100 students, ranging from ages 6 to 21, who have autism.  The center’s primary focus is to empower students to reach their full potential by teaching them life-long skills. The center also serves as an education resource and provides support and outreach services for families and the autism community.
It was a pleasure to visit the center and learn more about the services they provide.  
￼

Meeting with Juvenile Diabetes Foundation
I met with local representatives from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation in my Kingston congressional office to discuss Type 1 diabetes and the ways Congress can support research and policy consistent with addressing this condition. This past year, Congress increased funding for the National Institutes of Health by $3 billion over last year. It’s extremely important that we maintain robust research at the NIH, such as the Special Diabetes Program, in order to develop long-term treatments.

Kneller Insurance Agency Ribbon Cutting
It was a pleasure to attend the ribbon cutting and open house for Kneller Insurance in Chatham. Founded in 1976, the Kneller Agency operates four locations in Columbia County. Thank you for having me to join in celebration on this exciting day.

Dear Friend,  
This week, I noted the passing of Memphis native and ""Queen of Soul"" Aretha Franklin, paying my R-E-S-P-E-C-Ts at her birthplace on Lucy Street in South Memphis. I also condemned the vindictive revocation of former CIA Director John Brennan's security clearances, commended newspaper editorial pages for defending our First Amendment and standing up to the President’s relentless attacks on a free press, wrote to HUD Secretary Ben Carson regarding my concerns about chronic and ongoing health and safety risks related to poor management at some federally subsidized housing facilities in Memphis, recognized the 83rd anniversary of Social Security and provided information about a baby diaper shortage. Keep reading to learn more about my week and follow me on Twitter and Facebook to see more updates as they happen.

Remembering the ""Queen of Soul,"" Aretha Franklin 
￼ ￼ 
The world lost a great artist on Thursday. I was saddened to learn of the passing of Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul, who thrilled millions with her renditions of gospel, Motown, R & B, jazz and pop classics. I went to her Memphis birthplace at 406 Lucy Street in South Memphis Thursday afternoon to pay my R-E-S-P-E-C-Ts and saw many of her fans there for the same purpose. Aretha Franklin taught the world what R-E-S-P-E-C-T means. From her humble origins to her consistent place atop the Billboard charts, Aretha Franklin was truly the “Queen of Soul.” What a voice and what a passion she brought to her songs. Detroit, Memphis and the whole world have lost a very bright star. 
Defending Former CIA Director John Brennan  
￼ 
Shortly after the President revoked the security clearances of former CIA Director John Brennan, I put out a statement defending the man who helped capture Osama bin Laden and has long been combatting Russian attempts to interfere with our our democracy. Brennan knows a lot about the ongoing investigation of Trump’s campaign and Russian interference in our 2016 elections. It’s crystal clear that the revocation of the clearances is punishment for Brennan speaking the truth. The President continues to dishonor his high office and the American people with these petty, vindictive attacks. I stand with Brennan and suggest the next president restore this fine public servant’s ability to lend his wisdom to our men and women in the intelligence community. 
Standing Up for a Free Press 
 ￼ 
After The Boston Globe suggested that newspapers all across the country write editorials defending a free press on Thursday, I was pleased to see The Memphis Flyer and Commercial Appeal columnist David Waters taking that principled stand. Journalists, generally, but their readers, too, are genuinely fearful of what the President has unleashed with his accusations that reporters are the “enemies of the people” and that accurate, factual news he doesn’t like is “fake news.” Most serious journalists work hard to write accurate stories with adequate context and, when they fall short, correct errors immediately. Unlike many of the President’s favorite outlets, the mainstream media does not fabricate false “news” intended to mislead. I’m pleased the nation’s newspapers are making it clear that the only way a true democracy can function is with citizens having access to accurate news and commentary. 
Writing to HUD Secretary Ben Carson with Concerns 
This week I wrote to U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson with concerns about persistent health and safety risks present at HUD-subsidized housing units in Memphis resulting in low inspection scores. Earlier this Congress, I introduced the Housing Accountability Act with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida to strengthen federal oversight of the inspection process for federally subsidized affordable housing in an effort to address and prevent these safety violations. 
The recent low inspection scores indicate ongoing issues of failed maintenance and questionable federal oversight practices despite changes to the law and the media spotlight on the poor management of facilities like those formerly owned by the Global Ministries Foundation. In the letter, I asked HUD Secretary Carson what he is doing to get these properties into compliance with federal standards. I will report on his response when I receive it. See the letter here. 
Holding ""Congress On Your Corner"" This Thursday Evening  
On Thursday everning, my office will hold our monthly ""Congress On Your Corner"" event at the Whitehaven Branch Library, 4120 Millbranch Road, from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. My staff will be on hand to help with Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits and military service issues, Small Business Administration (SBA) loans and services, Federal Housing Authority (FHA) home loans, federal grant applications, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issues, visas, passports and more. While ""Congress On Your Corner"" hours have typically been during the day, we are adding some evening events to expand outreach to those whose schedules do not permit daytime attendance.   
Recognizing the 83rd Anniversary of Social Security 
￼ 
On Tuesday, I noted the 83rd anniversary of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s signing of the Social Security Act into law, creating old-age pensions and unemployment insurance. Critics at the time, including many Republicans, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Bar Association, called it “socialism.” Eighty-three years later, it is the cornerstone of our country’s commitment to seeing that our senior citizens and those who cannot work are able to live out their retirements in dignity and secure financial confidence. 
In recent years, we have defeated efforts to erode Social Security benefits or privatize hard-earned investments in our future, but aggressive efforts to push these risky ideas are still circulating and we must remain vigilant. I am committed to making Social Security -- the backbone of the safety net for our senior citizens and families -- as well as Medicare and Medicaid, stronger and to assuring their permanence.

Weekly Health Tip 
  
 ￼ 
Each week, I share a health tip in the hope of promoting a healthy lifestyle for residents of the 9th Congressional District. As always, it is best to check with your doctor before making any changes to your diet, exercise routine or lifestyle. 
Last week, I held a symposium at Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church on infant and maternal health with a variety of medical and other advocates and experts. During our discussion, the unaffordability of basic necessities, including clean diapers, was raised, and so was a proposed solution. In Memphis, 44 percent of children under 3 live in poverty and one in three mothers report running out of diapers each month. As a result, seldom discussed diaper rash is a serious problem in our community. The University of Memphis’ Institute for Interdisciplinary Memphis Partnerships to Advance Community Transformation (iIMPACT), the Coordinated Effort to Enhance Development (CEED), the Urban Child Institute and other partners are working to create a Shelby County Diaper Bank. The “Bundles for Babies” initiative is an excellent response to this critical need.
Quotes of the Week  
On Thursday, as noted above, the nation’s newspapers defended themselves and the First Amendment constitutional right of a free press in hundreds of editorials. Here is a sampling:
“As women’s rights pioneer and investigative journalist Ida B. Wells wrote in 1982: ‘The people must know before they can act and there is no educator to compare with the press.’” – Falls City (Nebraska) Journal. 
“The danger is that over time. Mr. Trump’s antics and the incivility he encourages could lead to the arrest of journalists or violence against them, and it could also erode the public’s faith in the First Amendment, which is the foundation of all our liberties.” – The Providence (Rhode Island) Journal. 
“Trump is inflicting massive, and perhaps irreparable, damage to democracy with these attacks.” The St. Louis (Missouri) Post-Dispatch. 
“That 44 percent of Republicans polled recently said Trump should have the autocrat’s power to shut down news outlets shows how successful his efforts have already been.” – The Kansas City (Missouri) Star. 
 As always, I remain, 
Most sincerely,

Opportunity Zones are helping revitalize our state
I was pleased to join Senator Shelley Moore Capito and Senator Tim Scott for a tour of The Market in downtown Huntington.  We had the chance to show Senator Scott the amazing things being done in Huntington’s Opportunity Zones and how they are revitalizing our cities and towns across the state.  These Opportunity Zones have helped spur economic growth in many areas across West Virginia and have led to job opportunities for West Virginians.

Water infrastructure is crucial for our state
I helped to secure $535,000 in federal funding for upgrades to the Page-Kincaid Public Service District in Fayette County.  The project will replace the plant's mechanical equipment, which is 35 years old and approaching the end of its useful service life.   Investment in water infrastructure is crucial for southern West Virginia’s rural communities. Access to safe, reliable, municipal water will help improve the quality of life for residents and attract new industries and development. 

￼ 
Helping our veterans 
This week I hosted a Veterans Mobile ID Clinic at the Hershel ""Woody"" Williams VA Medical Center to help veterans who have an honorable or general discharge sign up for their Veteran ID card.   The cards will be mailed to those who signed up and will provide them with proof of military service and is accepted by retailers in place of the standard DD-214 form.

Dear Lindsey, 
I met with medical professionals, local officials and healthcare industry workers at Newport Health Center on Monday to discuss their work to increase healthcare access in New Hampshire’s rural communities. Healthcare is a right, not a privilege, and the quality of care a person receives should not be dependent on where they live. We need to work together to improve our healthcare system so that every Granite Stater can access the care they need.

Combating Military Sexual Assault 
On Tuesday in Nashua, I met with Manchester VA Medical Center officials, Southern New Hampshire Health providers, military personnel, and survivors of military sexual trauma to discuss the unique challenges of those who experience sexual assault in the military, and to hear their insights into how we can solve this persistent problem. I also spoke about the legislative agenda the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence announced last month, which includes a provision to address military sexual assault. I will continue my efforts to make our military safer and remove barriers that have prevented survivors from coming forward and seeking justice.

Smart Trade Policies That Help Granite State Small Businesses 
I also had the opportunity to visit Commercial and Industrial Equipment Supplier Williams & Hussey Machine Company, Inc. in Amherst on Tuesday and tour their impressive facility. Steve Carter, the company’s President and CEO, spoke with me about the negative impact of President Trump’s trade policies on New Hampshire businesses like his. I remain deeply concerned about the president’s reckless trade war, and I will keep advocating for responsible, thoughtful trade policies that help Granite State workers and businesses succeed.

Tackling the Opioid Epidemic 
On Wednesday, I released a statement in response to the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services’ application to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) for opioid response funding that Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Senator Maggie Hassan, and Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter and I helped secure. I’ve been proud of the leadership of the Bipartisan Heroin and Opioid Task Force and the New Hampshire Congressional Delegation in securing significant resources to tackle this ongoing problem, but there is more work for us to do. We must bolster prevention, treatment, long-term recovery, and law enforcement efforts. I look forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle to continue to support families and communities in our state that have been impacted by this crisis.

WEEK IN REVIEW
￼
To start off this week's From the Front... I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nation’s capital, including Barry Knight of Lowell, Ann Williams of Lowell, and the Richburg family from Centerton. Safe travels back to the Natural State.
During the August district work period, I am traveling to all corners of the Third District to hear from you – my constituents. This week, I hosted two town halls. The first town hall was this past Tuesday in Fort Smith, and the second town hall was yesterday in Harrison. Topics of discussion included healthcare, social security, border security, immigration reform, concerns with the medical care our veterans receive, and the need to have a robust military in a world where both state and non-state actors are active in their opposition to the United States. I discussed my job as Chairman of the House Budget Committee, where we have passed through Committee our Budget for a Brighter American Future, and my role as co-chair of the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform. This Joint Select Committee has been tasked with reforming our flawed budget and appropriations process. Without question, the Joint Select Committee shares the common goal of having an effective budget and appropriations process, and as we determine fixes to the current process, it is my hope that we recommend a framework that works regardless of who holds the majority.
￼
I believe it is important for my constituents to have a forum to speak with me, and it is equally important that I have a chance to connect with you. I was pleased to know that so many people felt it was an important civic duty to come out and join me. My positions are a reflection of the majority views of Third District Arkansans, but I represent all constituents regardless of political viewpoints. What binds us together as Americans needs to remain stronger than anything that divides us. I hope you will take the opportunity to join me on Monday, August 20 in Russellville and Wednesday, August 22 in Bella Vista. 
As the August district work period continues, I had the opportunity to visit with a number of constituents in Northwest Arkansas. My first stop of the week was to Springdale Rotary Club, Springdale’s largest service club. I gave them an update on the happenings in Congress and legislation relevant to the Third District. After my visit with the Springdale Rotary, I traveled to Berryville to tour Connect 4. Connect 4 is a successful collaboration between 3 cities, 3 local school districts, Tyson Foods, Inc., and the state of Arkansas. They offer junior and senior students from the Berryville, Eureka Springs, and Green Forest school districts the opportunity to pursue a technical education during the school day. The goal is to provide well-rounded hands-on education. Connect 4 is providing the necessary cross-curricular background in different trades that will better prepare them for the future.
￼
I enjoyed a full day in Fort Smith on Tuesday with a number of stops. I started off my morning at the monthly Q&A. This event is a meeting for the community to discuss current events and politics. Thank you to everyone who came out—I enjoyed our conversation! I then attended the ribbon cutting ceremony for River Valley Primary Care Services. River Valley Primary Care Services is a provider of comprehensive and preventative health care to all residents in Arkansas, and we are glad to have them in the River Valley.
I then spent time at the Riverview Hope Campus, a nonprofit working to address homelessness and poverty in our community. Besides finding shelter at Hope Campus, others come for services such as meals, counseling, job placement, showers and laundry, Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous meetings, and care at the on-site Mercy or dental clinics. Riverview Hope Campus is doing great things for the people in our community!
￼
I had a great visit to Coca-Cola to see Fred Kirkpatrick ""Mr. K"", a WWII Veteran, who has worked at Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Fort Smith for 80 years! Mr. K began his career at Fort Smith Coca-Cola as an office clerk and spent three-and-a-half-years in the Army during World War II. He then returned to the Fort Smith plant to become office manager. Mr. K. later became head of production and oversaw all bottling and delivery operations at the plant. When he reached retirement age, Mr. K continued to come to the plant to create a museum on the second floor of the facility.
￼
My last stop on Tuesday before my Fort Smith town hall was to Zero Mountain, Inc. Zero Mountain specializes in cold storage and recently increased its workforce and footprint in the River Valley. The recent expansions increases total square footage by more than 500,000 square feet. Zero Mountain has nearly 1,000,000 cubic feet of freezer/cooler space and over 5,100,000 cubic feet of dry storage space at this location alone. I had a great time touring around the facility and meeting with the Zero Mountain staff!
I kicked off my Thursday in Harrison updating the Harrison Rotary Club on recent legislation passed in the House and answering any questions they had regarding the Third District. I then visited the Boone County Senior Center. The center provides regularly scheduled transportation for seniors who no longer drive and also provides home-delivered meals for them. The senior center is a great place for seniors to meet new friends, have a nutritious lunch, or join in exercise and computer classes. I gave an update on current legislative business and then joined everyone in a game of bingo! Thank you for inviting me to stop by!
￼
To wrap up my week, I spoke at the Rogers-Bentonville Elks Lodge #2144 Groundbreaking Ceremony on Friday. Besides a place for friends to get together, the Elks invest in their communities through programs that help children grow up healthy and drug-free, meet the needs of today’s veterans, and improve the quality of life. Thank you to all who came out to the groundbreaking!
Next week, I'll continue my travels through Arkansas's Third District and will host two additional town halls; I hope to see you! Remember to keep an eye on my website or check out my Twitter and Instagram pages to stay up-to-date with the latest news from the Third District and Washington.
POLICY UPDATE: APPROPRIATIONS
The House Appropriations Committee has been hard at work ensuring that all twelve government funding bills were passed out of the full committee before September 30, the end of the fiscal year. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I take my responsibility of funding our government and helping the people of Arkansas very seriously. You work hard for your tax dollars, and I work hard to make sure they are used on programs that work and make the lives of Arkansans better. The House Appropriations Committee completed the last of the twelve funding bills on July 25.
As bills continued to be passed out of the Appropriations Committee, the full House of Representatives began to debate and vote on these bills. I was proud to support these efforts and voted for legislation that is rebuilding our military and providing for our veterans. The bills I voted for also fund critical water projects in Arkansas, provide for our national defense and a pay raise for those serving our country, and fund the VA medical centers throughout Arkansas. The House of Representatives has currently passed six appropriations bills. These bills are: Defense; Military Construction and Veterans Affairs; the Legislative Branch; Energy and Water; Interior and Environment; and Financial Services and General Government.
The Senate Appropriations Committee has also passed all twelve appropriations bills through their committee. In addition to the Senate Appropriations Committee work, the full Senate has debated and passed seven of their bills. These bills include: Military Construction and Veterans Affairs; the Legislative Branch; Energy and Water; Interior and Environment; Financial Services and General Government; Agriculture; and Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development. The Senate has also started debating the Defense Appropriations bill and the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill. None of these bills have been signed into law.
However, there is still more work to do, and the end of the fiscal year is quickly approaching. Once passed by each chamber, these bills must be conferenced and voted on again before making their way to the President for a signature by September 30. 
For years now, Congress has missed this deadline and has instead passed short-term measures called Continuing Resolutions to keep the Federal Government open. In fact, since 2010, we’ve had to pass 37 of them. A key responsibility of Congress is to provide funding for the United States, and this means passing a funding bill on time. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I see firsthand the dysfunction of the our current budget and appropriations process.
In February, the House and the Senate formed a Joint Select Committee specifically charged with looking at potential changes to the system and recommending reforms to make the federal budgeting process workable for the modern Congress. I was proud to be named a co-chair of this bipartisan and bicameral panel. The federal budget and appropriations process is broken, and I do not take the responsibility of leading this committee lightly. For far too long the system has not worked as it should and this must be addressed. I am optimistic this group can find common ground and build bipartisan agreement to fix a broken system.
It is our duty to responsibly fund the government and to do so on time. These bills do important work such as fund our national defense and invest in critical infrastructure. I take my roles as House Budget Committee Chairman, an appropriator, and of the Joint Select Committee Co-chair seriously, and I am working to fix this broken system, making it work for the people of Arkansas.

No Time for a Vacation
As we approach the end of the fiscal year on September 30, there are many pressing issues in Congress that directly affect North Dakota, like the Farm Bill, flood protection and water infrastructure, rural air service, and preventing a government shutdown. On top of these issues facing immediate deadlines, we must also take action to protect access to affordable health care for all North Dakotans – especially those with pre-existing conditions – and push for smart trade policies that open markets for North Dakota’s agriculture, manufacturing, and energy industries being hurt by the trade war. Now is no time to take a vacation, so I’m rolling up my sleeves and am continuing to work as hard as I can throughout August and going forward to fight for North Dakotans. 
Passing a new Farm Bill before the current bill expires on September 30 would give our farmers and rural communities much-needed certainty, especially as the administration’s trade war continues to hurt commodity prices and puts the value of the fall harvest at risk. As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I helped write a strong, bipartisan bill that passed by a historic margin in the U.S. Senate, and I’m proud to be on the conference committee tasked with getting a compromise bill to the president’s desk. The conference committee has no time to waste, so I stand ready to sit around the negotiating table and get to work on behalf of our farmers and ranchers. 
￼ 
The Senate also needs to pass a water infrastructure bill that includes critical provisions I helped secure for the Fargo-Moorhead diversion and flood protection for Devils Lake, as well as funding to help rural communities improve aging wastewater treatment facilities. Water infrastructure is essential to maintaining quality of life in our rural communities, but repairs are often too expensive for local communities to cover on their own. Investments in our infrastructure are long overdue, and we need to pass this bill as soon as possible.
Authorization for the FAA to operate expires at the end of September, putting air travel and our state’s airports at risk. After a series of short term extensions, we must pass a bill to fund the FAA long-term to give airports the certainty they need to make investments, grow their service, and continue to give rural areas access to affordable air travel that’s essential to the movement of goods and people around our state.
￼ 
I recently met with Mental Health America of North Dakota in my Washington office to talk about the need to remove the stigma of mental health and find better ways to address addiction challenges as we work to improve access to health care.  
We also have the urgent need to protect millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions – about 300,000 of them in North Dakota alone – from efforts to roll back protections giving them better access to affordable health care. I’ve worked with Republicans and Democrats on common-sense reforms to improve the health reform law and cut costs for North Dakota families and small businesses, without taking away protections for those with pre-existing conditions, like cancer or diabetes, as the administration is trying to do. Congress should come together immediately to pass these bipartisan reforms, instead of letting the administration undermine North Dakotans' access to affordable and lifesaving care. I'm hearing from people across the state about why access to affordable health care is so important to them. Click here to hear their stories in their own words.  
On top of all of these urgent priorities, Congress must also govern responsibly and prevent a government shutdown at the end of September, which would be hugely damaging to our economy. North Dakotans sent me to Washington to work tirelessly on their behalf. Our farmers don’t take a break mid-harvest because of a heatwave, and I’m not taking a break just because Washington’s a bit muggy in August. There’s too much at stake for North Dakota.

We are taking a look at some of the important steps taken by the 115th Congress over the past seven months to improve our economy. From passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, to repealing parts of Dodd-Frank, our recently stagnant economy is soaring again. This graphic highlights the positive numbers in the July 2018 jobs report.

A look at a Recent Press Release on Georgia’s economy: Georgia Looks to Further Boost Effects of Tax Cuts
 
 
Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-GA) today issued the following statement after meeting with Georgia Governor Nathan Deal yesterday regarding state tax reform: 

""During my meeting with Governor Deal, we discussed several issues important to Georgia. Under Governor Deal’s leadership, Georgia has remained one of the nation’s best states to do business. We are competitive on a global scale and our economy is growing; but according to the governor, we can do even better by cutting state taxes on individuals, families, and small businesses. A bill is moving through the legislature that will cut our state income taxes for the first time in 80 years and, according to Governor Deal, these cuts are only possible because of Congress’ historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I encourage our state legislators to work together to pass this legislation for the sake of all Georgians.""

In Recent Economic News: House passes bill requiring more frequent reviews of financial regulations
 
 
From The Hill: 

The House on Tuesday easily approved a bipartisan bill requiring financial regulators to more frequently conduct comprehensive reviews of their banking regulations.

Rep. Barry Loudermilk’s (R-Ga.) Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act passed by a 264-143 vote, which included the support of 38 Democrats. 

The legislation amends the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act to require the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council and each federal financial agency to conduct a regulatory review every seven years.

More Success for Manufacturing
Wisconsin continues to experience positive economic conditions across a wide variety of sectors, particularly manufacturing. Over the past year, Wisconsin has added 17,600 manufacturing jobs to the workforce. That figure ranks 1st in the Midwest and 2nd among states nationwide!

This week, I visited the Wilson Hurd manufacturing plant, a subsidiary of Nelson Miller Inc, in Berlin, WI to discuss manufacturing practices and job growth across Wisconsin. Similar to many manufacturing plants across the country, Wilson Hurd has experienced difficulty filling positions due to the skilled labor shortage currently hindering many job seekers and employers nationwide.

I spoke to management and employees at the facility about the efforts Congress has made to address this issue by passing the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. I am eager to see the impact this legislation will have for manufacturing plants across Wisconsin as education and training becomes more readily available for job seekers.   

￼
 

Veteran Employment
Veterans throughout the United States now have access to more employment opportunities than they have in over a decade. This week, Veteran Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the veteran unemployment rate was at 3% at the end of July, almost a third of what it was in July of 2010 when it stood at a glaring 8.4%. 

Thanks to a booming economy bolstered by pro-growth economic policies, we are experiencing a veteran unemployment rate near record lows. Ensuring that our veterans receive the support necessary to enter the workforce is essential to maintaining economic growth. I am very pleased to see more veterans being employed and I thank them for their service to our country.

Weekly Roundup
Always nice to be in Berlin, where I gave the Kiwanis club an update on Congress' work to help improve manufacturing and technical education.

￼

It was a pleasure meeting the individuals at Wilson Hurd manufacturing and learning more about their business.

National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act Becomes Law 
 This week, President Trump signed the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act into law. This law will create a national N-1-1 number for Americans facing a mental health crisis. Many of you know someone who has struggled with a mental illness such as depression, or has taken their own life. The National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act takes steps to establish a nationwide 3-digit suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline, making the number as easy as dialing 9-1-1. As Chair of the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, I was grateful to have led the effort on passing this bipartisan solution that will bring us closer to helping those in need, and ending this growing crisis. Thank you, President Trump, for signing this important piece of legislation into law.  
Happy Birthday to the 101st Airborne Division 
Yesterday, we celebrated National Airborne Day, a day designated by Congress to honor our nation's airborne forces of the Armed Forces. We want to thank all of our nation’s airborne troops for their service, especially the 101st Airborne Division of Fort Campbell - the “Screaming Eagles” - who celebrated 76 years of service to our nation this week. From D-Day to the War on Terror and beyond, the storied history of the 101st Airborne Division deserves special recognition. These brave warriors fight each and every day to keep our nation safe and defend our freedoms around the world. This week we recognized and paid tribute to their legacy of heroes, their achievements, and sacrifices to our nation. We are incredibly grateful to each and every one of you for your dedication to our country - thank you!  
￼

Small Businesses Are Benefiting From Tax Cuts 
This week, it was reported that the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Small Business Optimism Index marked its second highest level in the survey’s 45-year history, at 107.9 – just shy of the July 1983 record-high of 108. Multiple recent surveys have had similar results, including CNBC and Wells Fargo. This is great news for our state, which led that nation in small business growth just last year. There’s no denying it. Since President Trump took office and Republicans passed historic tax reform, underlying business conditions have improved significantly. We are seeing record numbers in terms of job growth, pay increases, consumer confidence, and low unemployment. Our economy is booming in Tennessee - and there’s no signs of it letting up. As your Representative, I will continue to fight for policies in Congress that cut taxes, reduce regulations, promote free markets, and control government spending.  

Youth Unemployment Hits 52-Year Low  
In yet another sign of the continued growth and strengthening of the U.S. economy, the unemployment rate among young Americans fell to a 52-year low this summer. The Department of Labor announced on Thursday that, of Americans between the ages of 16 and 24 who were actively looking for work, 9.2% were unemployed.  This rate is the lowest midsummer benchmark of youth unemployment since 1966.  
￼
Having a job - even just for the summer - helps young Americans gain the skills they need to be successful employees, productive citizens, and good people. President Trump promised to improve the economy and help Americans get back to work, and he is doing just that! More opportunities are now available for people that have historically struggled to find good jobs. It is wonderful to see these results and to see so many young Americans preparing for their bright futures!

THIS WEEK IN GEORGIA'S 12TH DISTRICT...
 I toured the Brodie International headquarters and manufacturing facility in Statesboro.
￼

￼
Brodie provides world-class liquid flow meters and equipment for the petroleum and industrial markets and it was great to learn more about their operations and hear some of the challenges they face in their field. Thanks for having me!  I met with AgSouth Farm Credit to discuss the 2018 Farm Bill. As you know, the House and Senate have both passed their version of the Farm Bill, and I have been chosen to serve as a conferee for the conference committee that will hammer out the differences between the two bills. We talked about some of the Georgia-12 priorities that I will continue to advocate for during the conference process. 
￼
I hosted “Coffee with the Congressman” events in both Lyons and Glennville.
￼
￼
“Coffee with the Congressman” is a great way for me to meet with folks from Georgia’s 12th district, take some questions, and hear about some of the issues that are affecting our communities.  In Lyons, I also attended the Tattnall/Toombs County Farm Bureau Legislative Dinner. We were joined by Georgia Farm Bureau President, Gerald Long. 
￼
￼

As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, I am pleased to hear from our farmers about what is most important to them in the 2018 Farm Bill.
It was an honor to be invited by some of our Toombs County Commissioners to attend the ribbon cutting ceremony for the Normantown Family Park. 
￼

I was happy to say a few words and help celebrate the grand opening of such a beautiful, family friendly facility.
I traveled down the road to Midville where I attended the Midville Field Day Lunch. 
￼

￼

Thanks for having me!
I hosted a Veterans Town Hall for our Georgia-12 veterans in Swainsboro. I gave an update on my work in Washington and took some questions about the quality of care at our local VA hospitals. 
￼
During the 115th Congress, President Trump has signed over 20 pieces of legislation affecting the lives of our veterans into law and I remain committed to ensuring that all of our veterans receive the care that they deserve after their service. If you or anyone you know needs help navigating a federal agency, including the VA, please contact one of my district offices in Augusta, Statesboro, Dublin, or Vidalia!
I visited the Community Support Center in Glennville to receive a tour of the facility and meet some of the board members who make the inspirational work they do for their community possible.
￼
Thank you for supporting the Glennville area and delivering on your mission to “build healthy families and strong communities through positive relationships, programs, and collaborative relationships in the southeast.”
In Baxley, I toured Appling County Headstart! 
￼
￼
It was great to visit with the children and staff, as well as some of the seniors who are now using the new senior center which opened earlier this year.
I also spoke at the Baxley Kiwanis meeting to give an update on my work in Washington, take a few questions, and say hello to some folks at Sarah's in the City. 
￼
￼
Thanks for having me!
Before leaving Baxley, I visited the local Fastenal store.
￼
I took some time to visit with a few of the employees and learned more about their thriving business!
I hit the road and headed to Claxton where I visited the Evans Memorial Hospital to discuss some of the healthcare issues we are addressing at the federal level.
￼
I believe our current healthcare system is broken and it is time that we restore the doctor-patient relationship and put Georgia-12 constituents back in charge of their own healthcare decisions.
 To end the week, I visited the Food Lion in Augusta on S. Belair Road. 
￼
We had a great discussion about the 2018 Farm Bill and the importance of sending this legislation to the President’s desk on time. America provides the safest, most abundant food supply in the world and we have a responsibility to ensure that our farmers are taken care of and our grocery stores remain full.
While in the district this week, I also stopped by some of our local news outlets to talk about the pressing issues we face today, my work on behalf of the district, and my travels throughout Georgia-12.
￼

￼
*Jamie Gardner with Baxley News Banner*
I also announced this week that I will be hosting a Georgia-12 Fall Academy Day on September 8, 2018. 
￼

This is a great opportunity for young men and women from Georgia's 12th District to receive an academy overview and learn more about the application and nomination process from admission liaisons who will be in attendance! For more information, please visit → https://bit.ly/2OE52jj.
Constituent service is a top priority of mine, and my staff and I stand ready to help with issues at the federal level. Community Office Hours offer the opportunity for my office to provide constituents personal assistance on a wide array of federal issues such as Social Security, Veterans Affairs, Medicare, and others, in their local communities. To see the dates, times, and locations for upcoming Community Office Hours near you, please visit my website.

Long’s Short Report – Expanding access to health savings accounts  By Rep. Billy Long  Everyone knows how expensive health care is. It can wipeout one’s life savings in the blink of an eye. Many hard working taxpayers spend thousands of dollars on health care year in and year out. As health care costs continue to rise, this issue will only get worse. Along with my colleagues in the House of Representatives I have been working on and passing legislation that helps alleviate this problem, including increasing access to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs).  Twenty million Americans take advantage of these cost-saving accounts designed to help individuals and families with high-deductible health care plans put away pre-taxed dollars to pay for medical expenses, such as copayments, deductibles, coinsurance and other health-related expenses. Under current law, an individual can only contribute up to $3,450 to their HSA annually and a family can contribute up to only $6,900 for their family plan annually. If not used, individuals and families can roll their money over to the following year without it counting towards their yearly contribution.  Unfortunately, under current law, HSAs have numerous restrictions that prevent individuals and families from utilizing them on services such as telehealth services and primary care visits, which if covered, could save significant money over time. Along with these services, medical products and medications, such as diabetic test strips and over-the-counter medications, are not covered.  The House recently passed several bills that would help fix these problems, including H.R. 6311, the Increasing Access to Lower Premium Plans and Expanding Health Savings Accounts Act, and H.R. 6199, the Restoring Access to Medication and Modernizing Health Savings Accounts Act. H.R. 6311 would increase the amount of money an individual can add to their HSA up to $6,650 and a family up to $13,300. H.R. 6199 would reverse an Obamacare provision that prevents individuals from using their HSAs for over-the-counter medications and personal hygiene products.  Rising health care costs on individuals and families will continue to be an issue my colleagues and I address. We will do whatever is necessary for people not to have to choose between paying for health care or going without care.  For more information on my activities in our district and in Washington I encourage you to follow my Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/Rep.Billy.Long and my Twitter page at https://twitter.com/USRepLong.

I'm Listening
 
It has been a whirlwind through the Fifth District...productive and, as always, quite fun. I visited with farmers in Richmond, MO and organizations concerned about the extended drought occurring in Missouri this summer. They told me about their issues getting water to livestock and the water storage needed to address the problem. 
￼ ￼
Following these conversations, I penned a letter to Governor Parson and mentioned that a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) might help with the funding needed for proper water storage.  

￼
From there, I visited with friends in Lexington, MO for lunch (thanks for the pizza & smiles Patty Skelton) and onto one of my favorite stops for peaches and honey at Peter’s Market.
￼
At the Missouri State Fair this week in Sedalia. I had the opportunity to visit with Governor Parson about the drought and other issues. He is just as anxious as I am to help Missouri’s farmers.
￼

Enjoyed talking with my friends at the Missouri Cattleman’s building at the State Fair and met with the Pork Producers who wanted to know more about trade and tariffs. ￼
 Also at the state fair, I had the pleasure of visiting with Sherry Jones and others with Farm Credit Services.
￼
 In the district this week, we also opened a new satellite office in Marshall, Missouri to help constituents with government agencies. 
￼
Back in the city, what a pleasure to be able to help teachers kick off the start of a new school year at the Kansas City Public School convocation. Those teachers are ready for the new year. Our children are our most precious resource we must continue to fight for increases in education funding.  
And remembering an acknowledging Dr. Samuel U. Rodgers legacy of 50 years of service was an honor, especially during National Health Care Week. I presented him with a Congressional Resolution honoring the years of service.  
One of my last stops this week was attending a meeting with retirees regarding updates on the Central States Pension Fund.
I’m listening to constituents of the Fifth District. When I return to the Capitol. I’ll have my work list ready.
Warmly,
￼
Emanuel Cleaver, II 
Member of Congress

Morgan – Redwood County
 
Dear Friends,
 
This week, I met with folks at Hugo’s in Thief River Falls to tour the marketplace and hear about issues affecting grocers in western Minnesota. On Wednesday, I attended the Stevens County Farm Bureau annual meeting to catch up with local producers and answer their questions about trade and the Farm Bill. I have heard from many of my constituents about the hay shortage in the district, and I have been working to find solutions for the counties affected by flooding and drought. U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Farm Service Agency (FSA) announced on Thursday that Roseau, Kittson, and Lake of the Woods counties, in addition to others announced last week, are now eligible for emergency haying and grazing on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acres through September 30th. 
 
Sincerely,
￼ Congressman Collin C. Peterson
Minnesota 7th District
 
Emergency CRP Haying and Grazing Announced for Roseau, Kittson, and Lake of the Woods Counties
￼
 
Folks across the seventh district have reached out to me concerned by the hay shortage in Minnesota. Excessive rain in some parts of the state, drought in other parts, has destroyed a large portion of this year’s natural pasture growth, forcing many cattle producers to purchase hay from expensive outside sources. I have been working with state and local FSA officials to open Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acres in affected areas for emergency haying and grazing to alleviate some of the burden caused by the shortage.
 
On Thursday, U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency announced that seven counties in the seventh district are now eligible for emergency haying and grazing on CRP acres. 
 
Kittson, Lake of the Woods and Roseau counties were approved for emergency haying and grazing in addition to Jackson, Lyon, Murray, Yellow Medicine, and Cottonwood counties that were announced last week.
 
Emergency haying is available on general practice acres and State Acres for Wildlife Enhancement (SAFE)/CP 38 acres through August 31, and emergency grazing may continue on those same acres through September 30.
 
Landowners and operators should confirm details and availability with their local FSA offices.
 
Net Neutrality
In June 2018, the Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) officially repealed the net neutrality rules enacted by the Obama Administration in 2015. Many of you have expressed concern over the repeal, which gives internet service providers (ISPs) increased discretion over the content and prices available to their consumers.
 
In order to ensure equal access to all web content, I agreed to serve as an original co-sponsor to a resolution (H.J.Res. 129) under the Congressional Review Act that would fully restore the FCC’s net neutrality rules. Specifically, the resolution restores the ability of federal and state agencies to prevent ISPs from blocking online content. The resolution also restores restrictions on paid prioritization, which allows content owners to pay ISPs for faster service. 
 
The Senate approved its version of the resolution in May 2018, but the House is yet to act. For that reason, I signed a discharge petition to force its consideration. At this time, the discharge petition is gathering the support it needs to pass under House rules. 
 
I appreciate all of the input I have received from you regarding net neutrality. More than ever, it is important that any federal action serves to better connect rural residents, businesses, producers, and providers to each other and the world.
 
Stevens County Farm Bureau Annual Meeting
￼
 
I attended the Stevens County Farm Bureau annual meeting in Hancock on Wednesday. We enjoyed a picnic supper and talked about the latest happenings in Stevens County. I shared an update on the Farm Bill and answered as many questions as I could about trade and tariffs. The group had a good dialogue and I enjoyed seeing familiar faces and meeting a few new ones. I appreciate all the work that Farm Bureau and its members do for area farmers.
 
Hugo’s
￼
Chris Bruggeman and Store Director Jim Ranstrom
 
On Tuesday, I visited Hugo’s Family Marketplace in Thief River Falls. Store Director Jim Ranstrom gave me a tour of the market and told me about his experience with the business in Thief River Falls. Hugo’s first store opened in Grand Forks, North Dakota in 1939 as Pure Food Market. Since then, it has expanded to 10 locations in North Dakota and Minnesota. I appreciate the folks at Hugo’s taking time to meet with me and chat about the issues facing their industry.
 
Disaster Assessment Meetings
￼
 
My staff aid Meg Louwagie joined representatives from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Homeland Security and Emergency Management (HSEM) and Small Business Administration (SBA) as they began assessing the hardest hit areas in the Southern part of the district. Officials are working to determine if home owners will be able to qualify for individual assistance due to the flooding in June and July. I encourage the officials to efficiently complete assessments so our communities can begin to receive the resources they need to repair.
 
Drone Tech
￼
 
Northland Community and Technical College sponsored a “Drone Tech” summer camp for students and teachers to learn about drones. A member of my staff was at this event and was able to take a lesson on flying drones with one of the instructors. Drones are becoming increasingly useful for our society as new technologies develop. Advanced camera systems and increased range is allowing drones to be used for applications in agriculture, transportation, military, and many other fields. I want to thank the dedicated Northland College Staff and students for creating learning opportunities throughout the year.
 
Red Lake Inauguration Ceremony
￼
 
On Tuesday, the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians held the inauguration of their 2018 elected officials. There were five Council Members, the Treasurer, Secretary and the Chairman. Darrell G. Seki Sr., Chairman, encouraged the Red Lake Nation to come together for the event. During his speech, Chairman Seki said that the Red Lake people have been through some tough times with the campaign, drug abuse and the storms. He stressed the community’s need to move forward from those hardships.
 
I congratulate Chairman Seki and the other elected Council members and Officers on their election. It is an honor to serve in elected office with the support of your community. Thank you all for your commitment and service.
 
This Week in American History
￼
 
On August 13, 1893, the biggest fire in Minneapolis history burned twenty-three square blocks of the city and more than 150 buildings, leaving 1,500 people without shelter. Nearly three months of drought from June to August created perfect conditions for the fire to spread quickly across the city. Damages were estimated at $1 million – roughly $20 million in today’s dollars.
 
What’s the Story?
￼
 
The two jars of politically themed barbecue sauce shown above were produced by Walnut Grove Mercantile in Marshall. They feature several light-hearted jokes aimed at our country’s two major political parties. Walnut Grove Mercantile offers many great products, most of which are produced locally. Some of their best-known products include honey, fudge, syrup and preserves.

Friends,  
  
This week I hosted six more community coffees.  I started in Ashland on Monday, visited Cimarron and Garden City on Tuesday, jumped over to Scott City and Beeler on Wednesday, and ended the week in Buhler.  
  
It was evident in our stops that tariffs and trade, immigration, and the Farm Bill are some of the top issues across the district.
  
In addition to our coffee stops, I had great discussions across the district on issues like rural broadband, agribusiness development, school safety, and teacher appreciation. I also rode around with Dr. Randall Spare, DVM of Ashland and spoke with residents in Beeler to hear progress updates on rebuilding fences, cattle herds, and homes after last year’s devastating wild fires. 
  
I am enjoying my time traveling and hearing from so many different people. 
  
Please if you haven’t yet, join us on our Community Coffee Tour! Click HERE for next weeks schedule. We'll be in Goodland, Hoxie, Norton, Downs, St. Mary's, Onaga, Clay Center, Ellsworth.

One-size-fits-all regulations don't work. 
￼ 
Regulations are one of the leading killers of innovation and job growth. Companies like Kincaid Equipment are facing one-size-fits-all emission regulations that will mean thousands of additional costs for the Haven, Kan., manufacturer. 
On day one, this administration started rolling back burdensome regulations on our small businesses. We must continue to do so to help our Kansas communities.
Meeting with the Agribusiness Council
￼
Wichita is one of the largest economic hubs of our state, and so much of what we do in the First Congressional District runs through the businesses and organizations in that city. Because of the interconnectedness of the state, I believe it is vital that everyone in the state's agriculture industry work together to support the state's farmers and ranchers.  
I was honored to speak with members of the Wichita Agribusiness Council to discuss the Farm Bill, trade, tariffs and other issues impacting ag. As I begin my work on the Farm Bill Conference Committee, it's important to continue to have these discussions and fully understand how this legislation impacts all industries supporting agriculture so I can advocate for all producers.
Quality Care in South-Central Kansas
￼ 
The last time I was in Ashland, this hospital was still under construction. It was miraculously saved from the Starbuck Fire that swept through Clark County in early 2017 and is now a beautiful medical center delivering quality care to the people of south-central Kansas.  
My district is home to some of the best small hospitals in the country, and I continue to work hard in Washington D.C. to make healthcare more affordable and accessible to all. 
Western Kansas Manufacturers 
Association
￼
Manufacturing is a vital piece of the district's economy, and it's essential we continue working on the industry's behalf to remove regulatory burdens, keep taxes low and provide employees access to a qualified workforce.  
Thank you to the Western Kansas Manufacturers Association for the opportunity to hear directly from your members and learn more about the concerns and opportunities facing their businesses. 
Communities recovering from 2017 Starbuck
Fire
￼
￼  
After the 2017 Starbuck Fire devastated thousands of acres of farm and ranch land in Southwest Kansas, I spoke with impacted farmers and ranchers to learn how we could help them rebuild. Their concerns included regulations on new fencing and accountability for their lost cattle.  
  
￼ 
Over the past two days, I have had the opportunity to meet with folks in Clark and Lane counties to assess the recovery efforts and discuss what the future looks like for their farms and families. Residents in both counties said grass has returned and fences are back in place. There are still signs of the devastation, but life is moving forward. 
Kansas farmers are incredibly resilient, and I was proud to be able to include changes to current programs in the 2018 House Farm Bill to help with the fire recovery efforts.

See below for highlights of my week fighting for the priorities of Granite Staters.

This Week: Standing Up to Attacks on the Free Press

This week, led by New England’s own Boston Globe, hundreds of newspapers around the country published editorials decrying the President’s attacks on the free press. 
Read the Globe editorial here. 
It is critical that we stand with them and be clear: the press is not the enemy of the people, but a crucial pillar of our democracy. 
We must continue to support a free press, and I was pleased that the Senate unanimously passed a resolution this week affirming that the press is not the enemy of the people and serves a vital and indispensable role. 
In June, I hosted a panel on the state of the media and future of the free press, bringing together journalists and experts to discuss current threats to the first amendment. You can watch video of the discussion here. 
I was deeply concerned when during a Senate Commerce Committee oversight hearing of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) this week, I asked FCC Ajit Pai a simple yes or no question: “do you believe the President’s rhetoric is harmful to the values enshrined in the First Amendment of the United States Constitution?” and he couldn’t give me a straight answer. 
 ￼ 
You can watch the video of the exchange here. 
The last thing people should have to worry about when they become sick or get injured is how that unforeseen hardship will impact their credit scores. But for too many Americans, the burden of medical debt that has crippled their ability to invest, purchase consumer goods, and participate in our economy. 
According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 43 million Americans have overdue medical debt on their credit reports. We must continue working to make health care more affordable, which is why I’ve cosponsored legislation to lower the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs. But as such efforts continue, we must also help families protect their credit. This week I helped introduce a commonsense bill that would prevent medical debt from continuing to damage people's credit scores after it has been paid off. Read more about the bill here. 
This week was also National Health Center Week. To mark the week, I visited Health Care for the Homeless Program of Manchester, which provides vital health care to some of our most vulnerable citizens in New Hampshire, including those struggling with substance misuse. I was grateful to be there to discuss their critical work and that of community health centers across our state to build a stronger, healthier New Hampshire.
￼ 
As far too many Granite Staters know, New Hampshire is one of the hardest-hit states by the deadly fentanyl, heroin, and opioid epidemic. I worked with the rest of the New Hampshire Congressional Delegation to make sure the states hardest hit by this epidemic receive additional federal resources, securing for New Hampshire an additional $22.9 million in federal funding for the remainder of the fiscal year.  
This week the state applied for this funding, and I am pleased that the state’s application for this funding included important priorities that I have consistently supported, including expanding access to medication-assisted treatment, improving access to recovery housing, and increasing prevention services.
This fight is far from over, and I will continue fighting to ensure that those on the front lines of the epidemic have the resources they need to help Granite Staters struggling with addiction get their lives back on track. 
Recent reports indicated that President Trump is letting his friends at Mar-a-Lago, who have no experience in the military or government, make decisions at the VA that impact millions of veterans. 
Our veterans deserve better than this. So I sent a letter this week to the VA Inspector General calling on him to open an investigation into these reports and allegations.  
Similarly, we have a duty to shield our brave service members from predatory lending and financial fraud. There have been reports the Trump Administration is failing to uphold this duty, and we are calling on them to do so. Read our letter here. 
I was also pleased to announce this week that New Hampshire will be receiving millions in grants to improve our water infrastructure. 
Investing in New Hampshire’s aging water infrastructure is important to advancing the health, well-being, and safety of hard-working Granite Staters, and this federal funding is critical to those efforts. Read more about the grants here and here.

August 17, 2018                           
IG to Review Quiet Skies
At the end of July the Boston Globe published a detailed report about a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) program, “Quiet Skies”. Thousands of innocent Americans were surveilled based on the thinnest of reasons. This surveillance appears to have continued even after the passenger exited the terminal to the airport curb which means air marshals were also recording who was picking passengers up. This program raises many troubling questions and I asked the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General to conduct an audit of “Quiet Skies”, evaluating its compliance with the law, impact on personal privacy and overall effectiveness. The IG contacted our office this week to inform us that they would conduct this review. I am encouraged by their quick response. 
YWCA
I had an excellent meeting with officials from the YWCA programs in Cambridge and Boston who came to my office as part of a Day of Advocacy. The YWCA was founded in London in the mid-19th century and well-established in the United States before 1900. The organization brought visiting nurses to poor neighborhoods and provided safe spaces for working girls and women to meet and to study. It continues to do great work for women and girls, not only in social services and emergency support but also in empowerment. The organization is a force for social justice in our communities. YWCAs offer childcare services and summer camp and also sponsor career and leadership development programs. They provide emergency and family shelters and offer both counseling and advocacy on affordable housing. They offer economics classes and financial literacy workshops. Their comprehensive programs make a difference in the lives of woman and families.    
Transit Oriented Development
I participated this week in a productive discussion about transit oriented development with members of the commercial real estate industry. We all recognize that affordable housing is a problem in the Greater Boston area, with its high rents and soaring home prices. This creates a number of challenges including those related to transportation. When housing costs are high they can drive young families farther away from their places of employment in search of affordability – which creates a longer commute. Transit Oriented Development focuses on bringing residential, commercial and leisure spaces together near public transportation. It establishes more pedestrian friendly neighborhoods and can help increase affordability as well as reduce traffic congestion. This type of thoughtful real estate development is an important component of effective urban planning. I was encouraged to find developers receptive to these concepts.
 
Partners Healthcare
I spent some time this week with employees from Partners Healthcare at their Assembly Row site in Somerville. Their new building is state of the art and energy efficient. I had a good discussion with senior leadership from Partners about the state of health care in our country. We are all determined to protect the Affordable Care Act which is under attack by President Trump and Republicans in Washington. Officials also expressed worry over the way both scientific research and scientific data are undervalued and disregarded by the current administration. They are concerned, too, about the challenges facing Medicare. I appreciated their willingness to meet and share their views about health care.
 
Behind the Curtain – More House and Trump Administration Actions You Don’t Want to Miss
Here are this week’s additions. If you need to catch up or share with friends, you can find the full list here.
344:     According to an August 2018 BuzzFeed News report, members of Trump’s Florida resort and golf club, Mar-a-Lago, may be getting tours of Air Force One as an informal perk. BuzzFeed obtained records through a Freedom of Information Act request that strongly suggest this is a common practice. Those records were obscured due to some significant information redacting by the federal government. In response to the report the White House dodged the question by claiming it was common practice “for friends/family of the President to receive tours of Air Force One.”.
345:        An August 2018 Washington Post story describes a president who, to put it bluntly, lies – a lot. The Post determined that Trump made 2,140 false claims just in his first year. In the last six months that number practically doubled to 4,229. The newspaper studied a July 5th rally speech Trump gave in Montana, determining a whopping 76% of 98 statements he made were “false, misleading or unsupported by evidence.” This is astonishing, even for Trump.
346:        An August 2018 report from the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Homeland Security did not fully analyze the projected cost of Trump’s border wall or adhere to current acquisition rules as it makes plans for this key Trump priority. In the report, the GAO raised concerns that DHS has not effectively planned for the project and faces “an increased risk that the Border Wall System Program will cost more than projected, take longer than planned, or not fully perform as expected”. Nonetheless, undeterred by pertinent information, Trump is threatening to shut down the federal government if he doesn’t get his way with the wall.

Dear Friends, 
After our state work period last week, the Senate returned to session this week on Wednesday to continue our work on measures to fund the government and on confirming nominees to federal judgeships and other positions.
The Senate Committee on the Judiciary is preparing for its hearing on U.S. Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh and announced that it would begin on Sept. 4. On Thursday, I delivered remarks on the floor of the U.S. Senate to announce my support for Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination.
I believe there’s no better person to do the job than Brett Kavanaugh. He is the real deal. He’s written many opinions that have been affirmed by the Supreme Court, referenced by other courts, and adopted as a part of the law. That is a great testament to his ability and his intellect.  Additionally, Kavanaugh possesses the strong character and sense of justice required for a Supreme Court judge. He understands the importance of doing what is right, even when no one is looking and regardless of the answer you have to give. He understands that the role of a judge is to follow the law and interpret the Constitution as it is written, without regard to political considerations or his own personal preferences.  That’s why I’m going to vote to confirm him to the U.S. Supreme Court. He’s a regular guy who is devoted to his family and his community. He’s also a brilliant man who cares deeply about his country. He believes in his country and feels a responsibility to serve it. I can’t think of any better reason to vote for him. I’m going to vote for him with pride, and I encouraged my fellow senators to join me.

Fighting the Opioid Crisis
Last week, I spoke at the third meeting of the Statewide Opioid Task Force with Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr at Augusta University, where I provided an update to the standing-room-only crowd on federal initiatives to fight the opioid crisis. 
To win this battle, we must establish new lines of communication among all stakeholders. That’s why the Attorney General’s office created the Statewide Opioid Task Force last year to provide an infrastructure of communication between organizations in the public, private and non-profit sectors that are combating the opioid epidemic.
It was helpful to be able to hear again from officials from the state and share details about the comprehensive legislation we’re working on in Congress to fight the opioid epidemic. This legislative effort will require a multi-pronged approach, including addressing the often-overlooked problem of addiction itself. I’m proud to be a part of this “all hands on deck” approach as we work together to help more Georgians and Americans.
￼
Looking Out for Georgians
I was honored to receive the U.S. Chamber’s “Spirit of Enterprise Award” again this year, which was presented to me last week at an event with the Dunwoody Perimeter Chamber of Commerce.
The “Spirit of Enterprise Award” is a great honor, and I’m proud to be able to work in the Senate to advance our national interests. When our economy does well, hardworking Americans are able to find good jobs, create new opportunities and take care of their families and futures.
I have always tried to rely on my business experience when making policy decisions, including my work on the most recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and I look forward to continuing to work each day for the best interests of Georgians and Americans.

Easier Taxes? Think Again

Tax Scam For The Rich Targets Californians 
Last December, House Republicans passed their disastrous tax scam, ransacking the future of our children and robbing from hard-working families to further enrich big corporations and the wealthiest 1 percent. Every day, their dishonest tax scam message collapses further in the eyes of families, who are watching as the wealthy and well-connected hoard their massive windfalls. Wealthy corporations are shipping American jobs overseas and are on track to spend $1 trillion to enrich their shareholders and CEOs, Big Pharma is hiking prescription drug prices on seniors and families and Wall Street is raking in billions – while just 4 percent of American workers have seen any kind of bonus or wage increase from the tax scam.
￼ 
Congresswoman Pelosi joined Jonathan Capehart on AMJOY to discuss the Democratic agenda for the future and the disastrous Republican raw deal. 
The tax bill is particularly devastating for Californians, who are taking the hit after the bill dismantled the state and local tax deduction that millions of families across our state have come to rely on. According to the IRS, more than 6 million Californian households claim the state and local tax deduction, claiming an average of more than $18,000. To make matters worse, changes to the tax code tax code mean fewer investments in our neighborhoods and fewer affordable housing units built over the next decade – amid surging demand among families.
Speaker Ryan promised to make the tax code “much simpler,” but the tax bill has stuck the American people with a far more convoluted and complicated system.  The IRS is now urging taxpayers to check withholding to avoid tax surprises later and ensuring that people don’t overpay when it comes to filing their taxes.  Here are some resources you may need to file your taxes in an easy and timely manner:

Here to Stay 
This week we celebrated six years since the DACA initiative was finally implemented, giving thousands of patriotic, courageous young men and women the opportunity to use their skills and dreams to strengthen and enrich our communities and our country.  These talented young people embody our nation’s most sacred values of equality and opportunity, and through their hard-work and determination, make America more American. 
Yet, the Trump Administration continues to double down on their hateful, discriminatory, anti-immigrant agenda that terrorizes communities, condemns vulnerable women and children and tears families apart. Instead of listening to the will of the American people who overwhelmingly support DREAMers, the GOP is using these hard-working students, teachers, servicemembers and entrepreneurs as partisan political pawns in their reprehensible attack on our nation’s values.
The inspiring young DREAMers and their families are the pride of our nation and they deserve better than the life of fear and constant uncertainty that has been forced upon them. Democrats will never forget that our strength lies in our diversity, and we will continue to stand up against these relentless, shameful attacks on our immigrant heritage. We are committed to fighting For The People as we work to ensure that America remains a beacon of hope, opportunity and freedom for all.

My office recently assisted a constituent who was experiencing an issue with the Social Security Administration (SSA). He had contacted our office regarding a Supplemental Security Income (SSI) overpayment he believed he was incorrectly charged. As a result of this overpayment, he experienced a deduction in his SSI benefits and a suspension of his Medi-Cal insurance, putting him in financial hardship. Therefore, my office reached out to SSA on his behalf and conveyed the details of his situation. As a result, SSA concluded that the overpayment to his record was incorrect and made the appropriate adjustments to his monthly benefit amount.

August 17, 2018
 
 
Dear Friend,   Earlier this week, my proposal to provide new resources for local manufacturing economies like Rhode Island’s was signed into law.   This is a big win for Rhode Island workers. When they’re given a level playing field, Rhode Islanders will outwork and outperform any competitors. As a result of this new law, which I’ve been pressing my colleagues to pass since I first got to Congress, the Department of Defense will provide long-term investments in critical skills, infrastructure, research and development, and small businesses to strengthen national security innovation.  I’m looking forward to working with our private, public, and non-profit sectors to make sure Rhode Island can take full advantage of this opportunity. I’ll make sure to keep you informed of the work we’re doing.  Roundtable   Earlier today, I hosted a roundtable discussion with Rhode Island millennials to talk about the Democratic plan to clean up corruption in Washington. Democrats are committed to fixing our broken political system and returning to a government of, by, and for the people. That means taking power back from the special interests and making Washington work for the people.  Specifically, Democrats will:  1) Empower American voters by protecting the right to vote and safeguarding our election infrastructure;  2) Strengthen our nation’s ethics laws to end the revolving door in Washington and rein in the influence of lobbyists and big-money donors;  3) And fix our broken campaign system by ending the scourge of “dark money” and passing the DISCLOSE Act.  Click here to watch today’s discussion for yourself.  Providence Fire   Providence Fire Fighters put their lives on the line every day to protect Rhode Islanders. Our brave first responders deserve access to the best equipment and training available to them so that they can do their jobs safely and effectively.  That’s why I’m so pleased that, along with Senators Reed and Whitehouse and Congressman Langevin, I announced nearly $1 million in new federal funding that the Providence Fire Department will use to provide additional training for 173 Fire Fighters. I advocated directly with FEMA to secure this funding, and I’m proud that we delivered results for our first responders. Click here to learn more about this important announcement.  Shannon Bream   Last night, I spoke with Shannon Bream of Fox News about the work that Democrats are going to do if we’re entrusted with a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.  Democrats are fighting for the people. We know that the American people want a Congress that will drive down the cost of health care, create good-paying jobs and raise family incomes, and end the pervasive corruption in Washington. These are three things that President Trump promised to do. He’s failed to deliver on all three.  Some folks have asked why I even bother to go on Fox News given that much of its audience and its hosts lean to the right. The fact is that if we want to make real progress on the challenges we face, then we have to be willing to have conversations with folks we disagree with. I’m always going to stand strong and fight for the values I believe in, but that doesn’t mean I have to tune out everyone on the other side.  Click here to watch my interview from last night and let me know what you think.   As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns, please call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov.   You can also click here to follow my work on Twitter.    Warm Regards, ￼  David Cicilline Member of Congress

Dear Neighbor,
Earlier this week, I had a very exciting meeting at MD Anderson Cancer Center with Dr. Elizabeth Shpall and Dr. Katy Rezvani. They showed me their revolutionary treatment for Leukemia and Lymphoma, using the body’s own natural T-killer cells to target the cancer cells and destroy them without causing damage anywhere else in the body.

This treatment has been tested and proven effective in nearly 84 percent of Leukemia and Lymphoma patients that participated in the trial, and with no side effects. It is an exciting time since MD Anderson is moving into the final clinical phases of this work. I will continue my work to increase funding levels for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Peer Reviewed Grant Program, which supports the vital work of our Texas Medical Center institutions. The innovations and discoveries that these and other brilliant scientists are making will revolutionize the treatment and cure of cancer in the 21st century and beyond.  


￼
I also met with MD Anderson President, Dr. Peter Pisters (pictured above), Dr. Steven Hahn, Chief Medical Executive for MD Anderson, Brad Gibson, Vice President and Treasurer, and Chris Mckee, Associate Vice President, Business Affairs. We discussed the expansion of MD Anderson over the next decade.

Thanks for reading again! 
I've been busy this week, traveling around Arizona's Fifth Congressional District. It's so important for Members of Congress to receive input from a number of sources when we are away from Washington, D.C. I use all of the information given to me from constituents and industry and community leaders to guide my decisions in the Nation's Capital. I appreciate all of you who take the time to meet with me or to submit comments to my offices. 
Congress Should Read the Bills! 
￼ 
My guest for this week's podcast is Congressman Thomas Massie. Congressman Massie is one of the Members of Congress who actually reads and studies the bills we vote on. He applies a strict set of standards to each bill to influence his vote: Can we afford the legislation? Is the legislation constitutional? Is the legislation better done on the federal level or the local level? He is a highly entertaining, yet extremely thoughtful, individual, and I hope you'll enjoy this interview. Click this link or the logo above to listen. 
Fridays Stand for Freedom 
￼ 
Today, I look at the mishandled baggage reporting (MBR) rule. Losing a checked bag is a nightmare, and airline passengers should reasonably expect carriers to do everything in their power to prevent this terrible outcome. But the issue we need to consider is whether additional requirements on top of the sensible ones already in place will do noticeably more good. Click this link to learn more about what I've done to prevent the Department of Transportation from implementing any changes to the MBR rule before carrying out a cost-benefit analysis. 
August Recess 
Thank you to everyone who I've met with this month (so far). I've appreciated all of the interactions with constituents and businesses. Here are a few pictures from my events:

Legislative Update 
￼ 
It's been a little over a year since the U.S. House passed Grant's Law and sent it to the Senate for consideration. This bill will protect innocent Americans, but the Senate needs to first take action to send it to the President's desk. I'm continuing to work towards this end. 
We Support Our Veterans!
￼ 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 52,313 American veterans live in Arizona's Fifth District. You served your country admirably, and Congress is working to ensure that this nation keeps its promises to all of you. 
If you need any assistance with the Veterans Administration or a veterans-related issue, please do not hesitate to give my district office a call at (480) 699-8239. My staff stands ready to help.

￼
Hello and welcome to the office. I’ve been receiving a lot of mail about the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy and the impending vacancy on the Supreme Court.   First, let me say that I wish Justice Kennedy all the best for his well-deserved retirement. As many of you know, the President recently nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to fill Justice Kennedy’s seat on the Supreme Court. 
Now I should say up front that the power to approve or reject Supreme Court justices is reserved for the Senate, so if you’d like to weigh in, I encourage you to contact Ohio Senators Rob Portman and Sherrod Brown. As a member of the House of Representatives, I do not have the opportunity to participate in this process.   That said, my philosophy on the judicial branch is that courts must work to preserve the integrity of our Founders intentions as laid down in the Constitution by interpreting laws, rather than legislating from the bench. You have heard that a lot.
The President enforces our laws. The Courts interpret the law. But it’s Congress that creates laws. That’s the framework of our great democracy, and that’s the way it should be. 
I’m Brad Wenstrup. Thanks for visiting the office.

96 job-certified by Latte Academy. Sixty students earned their professional certificates in Bookkeeping, Quickbooks, Office Manager, Hospitality START, and Front Desk Representative at the Latte Training Academy graduation Wednesday evening. Instructors Larry Lee, Jocelyn Doreza, Jill Arenovski, Kanae Quinn, and Jim Arenovski made the presentations. Latte awarded another 36 students certificates in allied health programs earlier in the day. Tuition is underwritten with CW fees, which I increased last year in the Northern Mariana Islands Economic Expansion Act, U.S. Public Law 115-53. The training program itself started with seed money I got for Island Training Solutions years ago. Graduates came from all walks of life, younger and older, already working or looking for jobs or job advancement. They put in months of work to improve their lives. What an inspiration! 
 

US Labor must protect US workers

In a Congressional Record statement on Tuesday, I questioned the way the U.S. Department of Labor is enforcing its foreign labor certification program. On July 27, Pacific Rim Constructors, a contractor for Imperial Pacific International, began a “temporary” lay-off of its workers, many of whom are U.S. workers. Work went on at the casino construction site, however, using H-2B visa holders. Yet, to obtain an H-2B visa an employer must attest that they have not laid off and will not lay off any similarly employed U.S. worker, unless the layoff is for lawful, job-related reasons and unless all H-2B workers are laid off first. Before leaving Washington, I met with Assistant Secretary of Labor Katherine Brunett McGuire to alert her and ask her Department to intervene. To date, the U.S. workers remain laid-off. So, I have made a public statement to light a fire under the bureaucracy. Especially after all we did in this Congress to incentivize hiring U.S. workers by enacting the U.S. Workforce Act, we should not now allow foreign workers to take jobs held by U.S. workers. 
 

NDAA is law, $51M to Tinian divert

President Trump signed the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 on Monday authorizing $50.7 million for Air Force divert airfield projects on Tinian. $46 million will go towards construction of a cargo pad with taxiway extension and $4.7 million for a maintenance support facility north of the Tinian airport. Section 2863 bars any expenditure by the Defense Department for public infrastructure in the Marianas until an Economic Adjustment Committee reports to Congress on what civilian projects are needed to support proposed military activities. The report is due in May 2019. Only then would Congress decide whether to fund civilian infrastructure on Tinian or elsewhere. In all, the 2019 NDAA authorizes $717 billion for defense spending for fiscal 2019. It raises military pay by 2.6 percent and increases troop levels across the Armed Forces by about 16,000. 
 

Vets gain too in NDAA

Section 621 of the John S. McCain Act gives eligible veterans and their caregivers access to the Saipan Exchange Store and all other military commissaries, as well as to Morale, Welfare, and Recreation facilities worldwide. Eligible veterans are defined as Purple Heart recipients, Medal of Honor recipients, former prisoners of war, and veterans with a service-connected disability. The new benefit takes effect on January 1, 2020. Section 621 is referred to as the “Purple Heart and Disabled Veterans Equal Access Act of 2018.” The 2019 NDAA also extends the Military OneSource program from the current 180 days to a full year after separation or retirement from military service. The program helps with the transition from military to civilian life. Active-duty, National Guard, and reserve service members are eligible for the OneSource program, along with their families and survivors. 
 
 

Army veteran Greg Cing (left) and our Wounded Warrior Fellow and Marine Corps veteran Randy Johnson were thumbs up at this week’s veterans registration. Your congressional office is holding bimonthly sign-ups from now through December.
 

Veterans registration in full swing

Our veterans registration drive has begun. The goal is to increase the number of Northern Marianas veterans enrolled for health care services and benefits with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The more vets enrolled in the Marianas, the better the chance the Community-Based Outpatient Clinic feasibility study I included in the VA MISSION Act will recommend a VA-staffed health clinic here. The next event is Saturday, August 18, 10am - 2pm at the Joeten Superstore. The Commonwealth CNMI Military/Veterans Affairs Office will be there, too, with information about their services. All veterans, as well as military family members and friends are welcome. Please help make the CBOC study a success by registering and letting the VA know you are here. 
 
 

Happy ESGR Week! Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve chairman emeritus Major General (Ret.) Benny Paulino (left), Area Chair Rose Igitol, and State Chair Donald Clark (right) paid a courtesy visit to the congressional office on Friday. ESGR Week officially began today and continues through next week, when ESGR will be conducting briefings for employers and reservists on island, and recognizing exemplary employers who support their employees who serve in the Guard and Reserve. Thank you for the visit, ESGR, and for all that you do. 
 
 

50,000 books and counting. Joeten Kiyu Public Library Director Erlinda Naputi, the library staff, and patrons gathered on Thursday afternoon, when we dropped off another 850 books as part of my “Let’s Read!” initiative. I also shared the exciting news that after nine years hand-selecting books at the Library of Congress the congressional office has reached the 50,000-book milestone. Over that time, we have delivered books to every public school on Saipan, Tinian, and Rota, to the public libraries, the Center for Independent Living, the Northern Marianas Technical Institute, correctional facilities, and youth and senior centers. Book number 50,000 is currently in transit. 
 
 

“Let’s Read!” Canaries. Just in time for the start of the new school year, San Vicente Elementary received another ten boxes of books for its library. Your congressional staff in Washington selected the books from the Library of Congress for our “Let’s Read!” program. San Vicente’s library was almost entirely destroyed by Typhoon Soudelor in 2015; and we have been working to rebuild its books collection since. Pictured above, L-R (in front of books): SVES principal Paulette Sablan, SVES Canaries Isaiah Kingston Benavente, Reiana J. Benavente, and Amiah Grey Benavente, and SVES librarian Meena Benavente. Pictured behind the books: SVES employee Helen Malabo. 
 

Support for HIDTA application

Commonwealth Attorney General Ed Manibusan requested in June that I support his effort to have the Marianas designated as a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area and I quickly did so with a letter to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. This week, Deputy Director James Carroll let me know that the petition to add the Northern Marianas as part of the HIDTA program has been received and that my letter of support has been included as part of that submission. Illicit drugs, especially methamphetamine or ice, have taken a terrible toll on our community. Ice has been associated with organized crime, homicides, sexual assaults, armed robberies, domestic violence, child abuse, and crimes against property. According to the Commonwealth Department of Public Safety, there have been 200 drug arrests over the last two years. Designation as a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area and the federal resources it brings will help stem the flow of drugs into our islands, making them a safer and healthier place for us all to live. 
 

Restoring our national parks

National Parks personnel struggle constantly with the lack of funding to maintain lands and facilities they oversee. That is why I have joined Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah) and Ranking Member Raúl Grijalva (D-Arizona) as a cosponsor of their Restore Our Parks and Public Lands Act. This bipartisan bill would fund the massive maintenance backlog at our National Parks and on other public lands. We are all entrusted to use our public lands responsibly today, and to conserve them for the use of those who come after us. Importantly, H.R. 6510 also addresses the deplorable conditions at many of the schools run by the federal Bureau of Indian Education. I congratulate Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva for leading this bipartisan effort. 
 

$955k for coral reef conservation

The Commonwealth’s Bureau of Environmental and Coastal Quality and Division of Fish and Wildlife have been awarded $955,000 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has a Coral Reef Conservation Cooperative Agreement with the two agencies. Congress provides this funding to support local efforts that align with the national goals of improving management and reducing threats to coral reefs. In the Northern Marianas, the money pays the salaries and programs costs of the Education and Outreach Coordinator, Watershed Coordinator, Marine Protected Areas coordinator, and monitoring biologists. Summer internships, introducing post-secondary students to coral reef management, and the Coral Fellows program are covered by the grant, as is the Long-Term Monitoring Program, the Talakhaya Revegetation Project, and Garapan CAP Implementation. Congratulations to BECQ and Fish and Wildlife!
 

$750k for school maintenance

Our Public School System is receiving $750,000 to help conserve energy and weatherproof classrooms and other school buildings. Congress funds this Insular ABCs Deferred Maintenance project especially to help islands' schools repair facilities that pose a hazard to students. Roof, window, and door replacements, as well as upgrades to fire alarm systems and electrical and plumbing overhauls are among the improvements funded this year. The ABC project was an initiative of the Obama Administration. Funding is prioritized based on an assessment conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers in 2011. The Interior Department’s Office of Insular Affairs administers the funds. Congratulations to PSS!
 
 


Adios, Edward Hofschneider! Former congressional staff assistant Edward Hofschneider began a new career this week, as a high school English teacher at Tinian Junior/Senior High School. During his three years with the congressional office, Edward helped develop and manage our casework database, and oversaw operations at the Tinian district office. He also spearheaded multiple outreach initiatives on Saipan, Tinian, and Rota, including the Congressional App Challenge, Service Academy workshops, and College & Careers presentations for high school students. Thank you, Edward, and best wishes in all your future endeavors.

8/17/18 15:33,How to save a life.,"￼
I write today with exciting news: the  National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act , a bill that I wrote, then fought long and hard to push through Congress, has finally been signed into law by President Trump. With the help of countless Utahns—including families affected by suicide, school counselors, and dozens of mental health experts—we were able to pass historic legislation that will save thousands of lives.
  ￼ 
I met with students, teachers, parents, and community leaders at East High School in Salt Lake to talk about suicide prevention. 
More of America’s youth die each year from suicide than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and chronic lung disease combined. After meeting with Utah families, we determined that the greatest stumbling block in suicide prevention is access to help, particularly in a moment of crisis. My bill will shorten the national suicide hotline to a three-digit, easy-to-remember number, allowing our friends and loved ones to get the help they need—from trained call center crisis workers like those I met with  last year  in Salt Lake City—at the very moment they need it most.  
Too many Americans who are struggling with mental illness, or who see their family or friends suffering, don’t know where to turn for help.  But by making resources like the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline system more accessible and user-friendly, we can prevent countless tragedies. 
￼ 
I spoke on the Senate floor this week, celebrating passage of this historic bill. Click here for the video! 
We could not have gotten this bill across the finish without the help of Utahns whose lives have been affected by suicide.  I am heartbroken by their loss but hopeful that this law will turn the tide in the campaign against this epidemic.
 
Sincerely,
￼ 
Orrin

The UVM Medical Center Must Respect its Nurses by Negotiating a Fair Contract

￼

As UVM Medical Center nurses and hospital administrators continue contract negotiations, I urge the hospital to pay its nurses fairly. Pay equity with nurses in Plattsburgh, New York – where the cost of living is much lower than in Burlington, Vermont – is not at all “unrealistic,” as the hospital president insists. In fact, it’s quite fair, especially for a hospital that made nearly $90 million in profits last year and had enough money to give its top executives huge raises and bonuses. If UVM Medical Center can collectively pay its ten top executives $9.1 million, it surely can give its nurses a well-deserved raise. 

Earlier this week, I called upon the hospital’s Board of Trustees to take an active role in the contract negotiations. To date, the Board has refused to meet with the nurses. Just listening to and taking management’s side is not good enough. The Board must do what is right for the nursing workforce and for the hospital’s patients. For most people, the nurses are the hospital. They are also our neighbors, friends and family. Vermonters want to see them paid fairly and treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.

Summer Meals for Young Vermonters

￼

When school let out for the summer, nearly 40,000 children from low-income Vermont households lost access to the school breakfasts, lunches, and afterschool snacks they receive during the school year. That means it can be a real struggle for some families to provide kids with the nutrition they need during the summer. Hunger Free Vermont and school districts around the state do a great job providing free summer meals at roughly 300 sites all across Vermont.

$19 Million for Clean Water in Vermont

￼

Vermont will receive almost $19 million in much-needed funding from the EPA to improve our drinking water and wastewater systems. Families in parts of Vermont are struggling with PFAS contamination while others are dealing with millions of gallons of untreated or partially treated sewage being dumped into our waterways. This funding will help fund some much-needed water projects in Vermont. However, if we are serious about modernizing our aging water infrastructure in Vermont and across the country, we must make a significant and prolonged investment on the federal level. Instead of cutting rural water funding like the Trump administration has proposed, we should dramatically increase support for these types of critically important projects.

Expanding the Dental Care Workforce in Vermont

￼

Vermont Technical College will receive $400,000 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to create a new dental therapist program. Even though poor oral health can significantly affect a person’s life – from increased risk of diabetes and heart disease to the ability to hold down a job – millions of Americans live in areas with little or no access to affordable and quality dental care. This new program at Vermont Tech, in collaboration with Vermont’s excellent community health centers, will help educate a new generation of dental therapists who will help lead the way in improving access to oral health care.

Seniors: Medicare Card Changes to Protect Your Identity 

￼

Vermonters with Medicare will be receiving new cards in the mail with a new Medicare ID number that your doctor will need at your next visit. These cards were designed to protect your identity, because they no longer have your Social Security Number printed on them. Make sure to check your mail for your new card! Unfortunately, scammers have been trying to use this change to steal identities. Please know that no one from Medicare will ever call you and request personal information. If someone asks for your information or threatens to cancel your Medicare benefits, hang up and call 1-800-MEDICARE. If you have questions about the card or your Medicare benefits, my office is here to help at 800-339-9834.

The Hill Report   A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions Week of August 13 - August 17, 2018
For 56 years, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has been the primary way in which Congress executes its Article 1 constitutional obligation to “provide for the common defense.” In today’s dangerous world we cannot afford to allow our enemies the slightest military advantage, and we need to make sure our men and women serving on the front-lines are equipped with cutting-edge tools to keep us safe, secure, and successful on the battlefield.  This week, President Trump signed the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (NDAA) into law, which authorizes $716 billion in funding for our national defense for Fiscal Year 2019 and provides our service members the training, resources and equipment they need to defend against the threats of today and tomorrow. Altogether, I am proud to have supported this historic funding increase which:
	•	Provides resources for global counterterrorism efforts;
	•	Increases funding for training and equipment;
	•	Provides our troops the biggest pay raise in 9 years;
	•	And reforms the Pentagon.
I am also pleased to say that I helped secure a provision within the law that recognizes the importance of contributions of Spirit of America, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity, that has a 15-year track record of contributing critical private assistance to DoD missions worldwide in nearly 60 different countries. This provision will help ensure this critical partnership between the DoD and Spirit of America may continue so generous American citizens can continue to personally contribute to the efforts of our boots on the ground. Read more about Spirit of America’s active projects and completed efforts to support our servicemen and women, here.   Meetings in the District   Ben E. Keith Distributors  This week, I was delighted to tour the Ben E. Keith Distributors headquarters in Dallas, where they use leading-edge equipment and employ talented men and women to distribute beverages to businesses across Texas. When I toured the same facility last year, they had just begun installation of their new computerized product distribution system with miles of conveyor belts. This year, I was able to see it in action. This technology allows Ben E. Keith to better serve its customers, and it is always wonderful to see businesses making investments in North Texas.  
￼  Congressman Sessions touring the Ben E. Keith Distributors headquarters.   
 Infectious Disease Society of America  I am a strong advocate of both healthcare and protecting our country, so I enjoyed touring UT Southwestern and meeting with their infectious disease team. These men and women are among North Texas’ first line of defense when combating contagious medical threats. We discussed my past and present efforts to ensure that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) receives the funding it needs to continue to make life-saving discoveries, along with plans to enhance the Clements Hospital to help ensure Dallas is prepared for future infectious disease issues.
￼  Congressman Sessions speaking with the infectious disease team from UT Southwestern.  
Dallas Sigma Chi Alumni Chapter  As a leader of the Congressional Fraternal Caucus and a proud alumnus of Pi Kappa Alpha, I strongly believe in the support systems that Greek-letter organizations provide our young men and women. I was honored to speak at a meeting of the Sigma Chi Dallas alumni chapter, where we discussed my support of a strong national defense and policies that promote economic growth, in addition to my support of policies that protect the future of Greek life.

Dallas Police Department  Thank you to the Dallas Police Department for the opportunity to tour the DPD Fusion Center and for providing me with more insight into the RIGHT Care Pilot Program. This pilot program aims to improve the response time for mental health related incidences called into local police departments by being proactive with doctors, counselors, and mental health clinicians. I am excited to receive updates on their progress as the RIGHT Care Pilot Program continues. Our police officers are the cornerstone of our communities and I will continue to protect them just as they protect us.

Bald eagles. Peregrine falcons. Grizzly bears. Humpback whales.
The Endangered Species Act has been a critical tool in the preservation of these and many other species. Yet many plants and animals are at serious risk of survival due to human activity, including logging, mining, development, and climate change. In Oregon alone, dozens of species including salmon, whales, wolves, turtles, owls, and otters rely on protection from this bedrock conservation law.
But Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans are ramping up their attacks against these protections. Originally passed in 1973 with strong bipartisan support – at the behest of a Republican president – the Endangered Species Act has become a punching bag for Republicans railing against government overreach. This is all despite the fact that this law has kept 99 percent of species under its protection from going extinct – a stunning track record.
This year, these outrageous attacks took a new turn, becoming even more threatening. The Trump Administration has proposed a sweeping rollback of this law, weakening its most crucial protections and turning it into a rubber stamp for industry. At the same time, Republicans in Congress have introduced similar bills in the House and Senate in a coordinated effort to build more momentum to weaken this law. It’s a bleak outlook – but one we can and must change.
These species get no second chance. Once they are gone, that’s it. And if the Endangered Species Act goes extinct, so may they.
I won’t stand for it. And neither will the American people. Studies show that more than 4 in 5 Americans support the Act. We know that it helps keep human activity responsible and reasonable. And we know that without it, we risk losing what little balance it has been able to preserve.
I’ll stand strong against these attacks, speaking out and rallying against the threats they pose to some of our most iconic – and most humble – species. The future of iconic creatures, and of our planet as we know it, depends on it. 

Courage, 
￼

 Hosting President Trump at Fort Drum 
￼  
It was an honor to host President Trump at Fort Drum as he signed the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) into law. This year’s NDAA contains the largest pay raise for our troops in nine years, and includes several provisions I authored to support military families and wounded servicemembers. This bipartisan bill also strengthens our military readiness, which will help military installations around the country – including Fort Drum. As a Member of the House Intelligence Committee, I am also pleased that this legislation includes several provisions to counter Russian aggression and to impose new sanctions on the Russian arms industry. Click here to read more about this week's visit by President Trump and about this year's NDAA.  
Fighting the Opioid Epidemic in the North Country and Beyond 
￼ 
This week, I hosted Saratoga County leaders for a roundtable focused on combating the heroin and opioid epidemic that is devastating communities across the North Country and the Nation. The opioid epidemic touches our communities, our homes, and our families in ways that have grave effects on everyday people and everyday lives. Thank you to all of the the community leaders who participated in our productive roundtable discussion. To learn more about our roundtable in Wilton, and about my work in Congress to end addiction, click here. 
￼ 
I’m grateful to constituents like Bob Dean from Queensbury who continue to share their personal stories with me as we work to pass further legislation to end the heroin and opioid epidemic. I invite you to take a moment to hear Bob's story and to learn about my work in Congress to end addiction and promote recovery. Click here or on the image above to learn more. 
Protecting Lake Champlain 
￼ 
I toured the site of the former Willsboro Dam with representatives from the Lake Champlain Basin Program (LCBP) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). With the assistance of the LCBP and USFWS, the Willsboro Dam was removed in 2015 – effectively reopening over 100 miles of the Boquet River Watershed to Atlantic salmon and improving the river’s water quality and natural flood resilience. I proudly crossed party lines to save the LCBP from elimination and led the fight to nearly double LCBP funding in the recent House appropriations bill. Click here to read more about my visit. 
Mountain Lake Services Annual Picnic 
￼ 
Mountain Lake Services has been enriching the lives of the developmentally disabled in Essex County for over 50 years. We’re grateful for the work they do to provide support and services to countless individuals and their families. Thank you to Mountain Lake Services for inviting me to their annual picnic in Port Henry to celebrate their impressive achievements!
Grant Cottage 
￼  
Visitors from across the country come to learn about the life and history of President Ulysses S. Grant at Grant Cottage in Wilton. Thank you to the staff at Grant Cottage for hosting me, and for all the work you do to strengthen our tourism economy and share our history!  
Assistance with Veterans Benefits 
￼ 
Our district is home to more veterans than any other district in New York State. I’m proud that my offices have helped NY-21 veterans recover over $2.7 million in VA benefits. If you’re having issues accessing your VA benefits or know a veteran who is, don’t hesitate to contact us with your specific casework needs. Click here for more information.

With his audience sitting comfortably, Mr. Trump — along with Vice President Mike Pence and U.S. Rep. Elise M. Stefanik, R-Willsboro — hit the highlights of the bill’s appropriations, punctuated by cheers from the assembled soldiers. “This an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill,” Ms. Stefanik, who repeatedly advocated for the bill to be signed at Fort Drum, told the Times. “This is the earliest we’ve ever had the NDAA signed since the 1970s.”

8/17/18 13:12,House Republicans Are Putting America First,"￼ 
PROUD TO SERVE MISSISSIPPI’S THIRD DISTRICT 
Dear Friend,

Two years ago, House Republicans established a new, bold policy agenda entitled A Better Way to address some of the largest challenges facing our country. I am honored to represent Mississippi's Third Congressional District in our mission to rebuild a stronger, safer America. 

I'm proud to tell you that America is stronger at home and abroad, with a booming economy, safer communities, and a revived military. We are delivering on our promises, and we are putting America first. 

I want to highlight our legislative victories to provide for the common defense, to support workforce development, to reform immigration policy and secure our nation's borders, to pass groundbreaking tax reform - bringing relief to American families, to address regulatory reform, to pass resolutions under the Congressional Review Act, to reform Dodd-Frank - bringing relief to our community banks, and providing Americans with access to capital. 

Defense

H.R. 5515 -- FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)

This bill takes the crucial next steps to rebuilding our military and reforming the Pentagon. This legislation authorizes the$80 billion increase in defense spending approved by Congress. It increases funding for troop readiness and rebuilding our military, and includes a 2.6% pay raise for our troops.

H.R. 1625 -- Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018

The bill provides $654.6 billion for the Department of Defense, the largest investment in our armed forces in 15 years, and funds a 2.4 percent pay raise for our troops.

H.R. 6157, Fiscal Year 2019 Department of Defense Appropriations Act

The bill totals $674.6 billion for the Department of Defense-consistent with the National Defense Authorization Act and the recent budget agreement. This funding will continue to rebuild our Armed Forces, restore military readiness, and care for our service members and their families, including full funding for the largest troop pay raise in nine years.

H.R. 3364 -- Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Signed into law)

Includes sanctions against Iran, Russia, and North Korea -- including the Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act of 2017, Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017, and Korean Interdiction and Modernization of Sanctions Act.

H.R. 3898 -- Otto Warmbier North Korea Sanctions Act

Named after a U.S. student who died after he was imprisoned in North Korea, this bill would strengthen and expand existing sanctions and Congress's oversight of North Korea sanctions.

H.R. 1698 -- Iran Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement Act

Mandates the president impose sanctions on foreign persons and entities involved with Iran's ballistic missile program and those who provide or receive conventional weapons from Iran.

H.R. 4744 -- Iran Human Rights and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act

Increase sanctions on the Iranian regime for egregious human rights violations. It will impose sanctions on Iranian officials and their family members responsible for politically motivated detentions of U.S. citizens and residents, or abuses against Iranian expatriates.

H.R. 1638 -- Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act

Requires the Department of the Treasury to release an annual report of funds or assets held, directly or indirectly, by specific Iranian officials. This is an effort to prevent the financing of terrorism, money laundering, and to make financial institutions' required compliance with remaining sanctions more easily understood.

H.R. 4324 -- Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access to Finance Act

Requires the Department of the Treasury to report to the Congress on the financing of aircraft purchases by Iran. It directs the Secretary of the Treasury to certify whether or not those transactions involve activities that could be sanc­tioned under current law.

H.R. 3329 -- Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Amendments Act

Further ramps up pressure on entities that provide weapons to the terrorist organization Hezbollah. Targets Hezbollah's fundraising and recruiting efforts-including its attempts to crowdsource small donations to support its fighters.

H.R. 3342 -- Sanctioning Hezbollah's Illicit Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields Act

Identifies and sanctions Hezbollah commanders complicit in or responsible for ordering or directing the use of human shields. Extends sanctions to those who provide material support to those involved in this significant human rights abuse.

Workforce Development

H.R. 2 -- SNAP Workforce Solutions (Farm Bill)

Creates a streamlined, simplified work requirement through meaningful investments in workforce development.

H.R.1989--VET TECAct (Signed into law)

Creates pilot program to provide eligible veterans with the opportunity to enroll in high technology programs of education through the GI Bill.

H.R.2353 -- Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act

This bill amends the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (Perkins Act) to help more Americans enter the workforce with the skills necessary to compete for and succeed in high-skilled, in-demand careers. It simplifies the application process for receiving federal funds and provides more flexibility to use federal resources to respond to changing education and economic needs.

H.R. 284 2 -- Accelerating Individuals Into the Workforce

Provides funding for wage subsidies, encourages employers to work directly with state and local agencies to hire TANF recipients and provide them the work experience they need to secure a job.

H.R. 4111 -- Spurring Business in Communities Act of 2017

Requires the Small Business Administration to put a focus on how applications are reviewed and processed, and help increase the amount of capital flowing throughout the Small Business Investment Company program to underserved areas of the country.

H.R. 1680 -- Women's Business Centers Improvements Act of 2018

Will reauthorize the Women's Business Centers (WBCs) program through 2022 and improve the accreditation process. There are more than 100 WBC educational centers throughout the United States, which are set up to help women starting and growing small businesses.

H.R. 3170 -- Small Business Development Center Cyber Security Training Act of 2017

Immigration and Border Security

H.R. 3219 -- Provisions to Fully Fund the President's Request for a Border Wall

Fully funds President Trump's FY2018 $1.6 billion request. 

H.R. 3004 -- Kate's Law

Enhances penalties for individuals who unlawfully return to the United States.

H.R. 3003 -- No Sanctuary for Criminals Act

Strengthens the law to combat dangerous sanctuary policies that shield criminal unlawful immi­grants from federal immigration enforcement.

Tax Reform

H.R. 1 -- Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Signed into law)

Major elements of the bill include reducing tax rates for businesses and individuals; a personal tax simplifica­tion by increasing the standard deduction and family tax credits, reducing the alternative minimum tax for individuals and eliminating it for corporations; reducing the number of estates impacted by the estate tax; and repealing the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

Regulatory Reform

H.R. 26 -- REINS Act

The REINS Act requires every new regulation that costs more than $100 million to be approved by Congress. The idea behind this bill is simple: If a regulation from a federal agency is going to have a major impact on the economy, then Congress ought to have a say.

H.R. 5 -- Regulatory Accountability Act

This bill requires agencies to choose the least-costly option available to accomplish their goals. It also prohibits large rules from going into effect while they are being challenged in court. Further, it would end ""Chevron deference,"" a doctrine that stacks the legal system in favor of the bureaucracy by directing judges to defer to an agency's interpretation of its own rules.

Resolutions Under the Congressional Review Act

H.J. Res 38 --The Stream Buffer Rule (Signed into law)

Repeals a rule that would have saddled mines with unnecessary regulations, putting up to 64% of America's coal reserves off limits and threatening between 40,000 to 70,000 mining jobs.

H.J. Res 41-- The SEC Disclosure Rule for Resource Extraction (Signed into law)

Repeals a rule that would have put an unreasonable compliance burden on publicly-traded American energy companies, putting them at a disadvantage to foreign-owned businesses.

H.J. Res 40 --The Social Security Service's Second Amendment Restrictions (Signed into law)

Repeals restrictions that would increase scrutiny on up to 4.2 million law-abiding disabled Americans attempting to purchase firearms, potentially depriving people of their constitutional rights without proper due process protections.

H.J. Res 37 --The Federal Contracts Blacklisting Rule (Signed into law)

Repeals a rule that would unjustly block many businesses accused of violating labor laws from federal contracts before they've even had a chance to defend themselves in court.

H.J. Res. 36 --The Bureau of Land Management Venting and Flaring Rule (Failed in the Senate)

Repeals a rule that would further cap methane emissions in the oil and gas industry at a time when the industry is already dramatically reducing emissions, potentially wiping out family-owned marginal wells and costing an estimated $1 billion.

H.J. Res 44 --The Bureau of Land Management Planning 2.0 Rule (Signed into law)

Repeals a rule that would reduce local authority over large swaths of land out west, massively expanding the federal government's control more than 175 million acres of land-about 4,000 times the size of Washington, D.C. - in 11 western states. 

H.J. Res 58 --The Teacher Preparation Rule (Signed into law)

Repeals a rule that would force states to use Washington's standards to determine whether a teacher prepa­ration program is effective, undermining local control over education and potentially exacerbating the shortage of special education teachers.

H.J. Res 57 --The Education Accountability Rule (Signed into law)

Repeals a rule that would be an unfunded mandate imposing Washington's standard for how to assess schools on state and local governments.

H.J. Res. 42 --The Unemployment Insurance Drug Testing Rule (Signed into law)

Repeals a rule that would severely restrict states' ability to limit drug abusers from receiving unemployment benefits even if the drug users are not able and available for work, as the law requires.

H.J. Res 66 --The State Retirement Plan Rule (Signed into law)

Repeals a rule that would treat employees unequally by allowing states to force some workers into second-ti­er government-run retirement accounts that lack the same protections as private-sector accounts.

H.J. Res 67 --The Local Retirement Plan Rule (Signed into law)

Repeals a rule that would treat employees unequally by allowing certain localities to force some workers into second-tier government-run retirement accounts that lack the same protections as private-sector accounts. 

H.J. Res 69 -- The National Wildlife Hunting and Fishing Rule (Signed into law)

Repeals a rule that would infringe on Alaska's right to sustainably manage fish and wildlife by over-regulating hunting-a move that could set the stage for the federal government to undermine local control across the U.S.

H.J. Res 43 -- The Title X Abortion Funding Rule (Signed into law)

Repeals a rule that would force states to administer Title X health funding to abortion providers, even if states want to redirect those funds to community health centers and hospitals that offer more comprehensive coverage.

H.J. Res 83 -- The OSHA Power Grab Rule (Signed into law)

Repeals a rule that is clearly unlawful. The law explicitly states that employers can only be targeted for failing to keep proper health and safety records within a six-month time period. The rule we overturned would have extended that to a full five years.

H.J. Res 34 -- FCC Internet Service Provider Rule (Signed into law)

This bill would treat internet service providers (ISPs) the same as other companies like Google and Facebook by applying the same privacy rules to everyone.

H.J. Res 111 -- CFPB Rule (Signed into law)

This bill would nullify the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) harmful arbitration rule.

S.J. Res. 57 -- Congressional Review Act Resolution to disapprove the CFPB's 2013 Auto Bulletin (Signed into law) 

Nullifies the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's 2013 guidance addressing indirect auto lending. This guidance describes auto lenders' responsibility, established by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, to avoid discriminatory lending practices. Lending discrimination in the auto market, substantiated by data time and again, has long been prevalent.

Community Bank Relief (Dodd-Frank Reform) 

S.2155 Economic Growth -- Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (Signed into law)

Helps tailor regulatory standards for community banks and smaller financial institutions, which were dispro­portionately hurt by the one-size-fits-all regulations of Dodd-Frank. This will allow community banks to free up resources to do their jobs - supporting community growth and serving small businesses and entrepreneurs. 

Access to Capital 

S. 488 -- JOBS and Investor Confidence Act of 2018 (House amendment)

The bill combines provisions of numerous bills primarily designed to spur entrepreneurship by reinvigorating business startups and initial public offerings.

HR 79-- HALOS Act

This bill directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to revise Regulation D, which exempts certain offerings from SEC registration requirements but prohibits general solicitation or general advertising with respect to such offerings.

Updates requirements for merger-and-acquisition brokers that facilitate transfer of ownership in private­ly-held companies with earnings or revenues under a specified threshold.

HR 1153-- Mortgage Choice Act of 2017

Provides clarity on the points and fees necessary to become a qualified mortgage, increasing the choice for low and moderate-income borrowers and first-time homebuyers. This legislation preserves consumer choice and helps our fellow Americans achieve the dream of becoming homeowners.

HR 15 85 -- Fair Investment Opportunities for Professional Experts Act

This bill amends the Securities Act of 1933 to modify the definition of ""accredited investor"" for purposes of participating in private offerings.

Provides the Securities and Exchange Commission's Office of Credit Ratings with discretion concerning reviewable matters during its annual examination of nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.

HR 3973 -- Market Data Protection Act of 2017

Requires the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the operator of the consolidated audit trail (a database that tracks trading in equities and options markets) to develop internal risk control mechanisms to protect stored market data.

HR 3978--TRID Improvement Act of 2017

Modifies disclosure requirements applicable to mortgage loan transactions. Specifically, the disclosed charges for any title insurance premium shall be equal to the amount charged for each individual title insurance policy, subject to any discounts as required by either state regulation or the title company rate filings.

HR 4292--Financial Institution Living Will Improvement Act of 2017

This bill amends the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to limit the frequency with which certain nonbank financial companies and bank holding companies shall be required to submit a
""living will"" (i.e., the company's plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of financial distress or failure) to the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), the Financial Stability Oversight Council, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Specifically, such companies shall be required to do so no more than once every two years.

HR 4545--Financial Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act

8/17/18 13:09,Blaine’s Bulletin: How My Office Can Help You,"￼ 
August 17, 2018

BLAINE'S BULLETIN

When we think of Congress we often picture laws being crafted in the Capitol, or Congressmen visiting local Missouri businesses, and meeting with families around the district.  While those are certainly some of my top priorities, my office offers assistance and provides many other opportunities that are not necessarily widely known. From helping veterans with the VA to White House and Capitol tours in Washington D.C., we perform many services you can take advantage of.  
Visiting Washington D.C.
In the month of July, my office had the opportunity to give U.S. Capitol tours to more than 280 Missourians! If you’re planning a trip to Washington D.C. please reach out to my office as soon as you know your plans. We are happy to give you a tour of the U.S. Capitol led by a member of my staff.  We can also coordinate tours of the Supreme Court, Library of Congress, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and even the FBI headquarters. If you’re interested in a White House tour, I urge you to reach out as soon as possible due to high demand and limited availability. 
Help with Federal Agencies
My office in Jefferson City is always available to assist constituents with any problems they may be having with federal agencies. This includes assistance on a wide array of federal issues such as Social Security, Veterans Affairs, Medicare and many others. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to my office if you need help! Our constituent liaisons also hold constituent service days each quarter, traveling across the 3rd district to provide services to constituents who may not live close to an office. Keep an eye on my website for dates and locations of constituent service days.
Service Academy Nominations
I encourage the many outstanding young men and women throughout the 3rd district to contact my office and learn more about the service academy admissions process. They provide the opportunity for an exceptional education and a chance to serve our nation. The four United States service academies accepting Congressional nominations are West Point in New York (Army), the U.S. Naval Academy in Maryland (Navy and Marine Corps), the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado (Air Force), and the Merchant Marine Academy in New York (Merchant Marine). The U.S. Coast Guard Academy does not require Congressional nominations, but my office can provide information about it. Any interested students can contact my Jefferson City office at 573-635-7232 for more information about the academy process.
Flags
Another little-known service we provide is the ability get Missourians a flag flown over the United States Capitol.  Whether it’s to commemorate a specific event like a graduation, retirement, or birthday or simply to fly Old Glory at your house we are ready to assist you. If you’re interested in obtaining a flag flown over the United States Capitol, please call my Washington D.C. office or fill out the form on my website Luetkemeyer.House.Gov.
Internships
Calling all college students and recent graduates! If you’re energetic, hard-working, and interested in working in a fast-paced environment, apply to intern in my Jefferson City or Washington D.C. offices.

Congratulations to my friend Christel DeHaan, the winner of the Indiana Indian Business Council’s Ratna Award. It’s always an honor celebrating the Indian community within the great state of Indiana.
￼
A big thank you to my district office summer interns, Chase Icenogle and Wayne Walker, for working many hours helping the great people of Indiana’s 4th District.
￼
I had a wonderful time at the India Celebrate Our Impact Gala. Thank you to my friend Ramu Chinthala and to the rest of the hosts for putting on this great event.

The Opioid Abuse Epidemic, Our Communities, Our Concerns
YOU ARE INVITED!
Come and participate in my office’s upcoming event on August 18th, called The Opioid Abuse Epidemic: Our Communities, Our Concerns. The event will take place at 10am at the Hendricks Power Exposition on the Hendricks County Fairgrounds.
￼
As you are well aware, the opioid epidemic is infiltrating our cities, towns, and neighborhoods. This is leaving a devastating impact on our future generations. I have traveled across Indiana and have heard countless stories about the devastating effects that the opioid addiction continues to have on all lives. This is one epidemic that knows no bounds. That is why I have proactively spoken with officers from around the state and other local leaders about the root causes of this epidemic and the importance of taking action on this issue.
Our event will feature experts in the field and will provide important resources that can help those who are impacted by this crisis. You can find more information about the event by going to our website at Rokita.house.gov or calling my office at (317) 718-0404. We hope to see you there.
Remembering Charly Butcher
On Wednesday, my friends in northeast Indiana made me aware of the unfortunate news that my friend, revered WOWO broadcaster Charly Butcher, passed away.
Charly was the loving husband of elementary school teacher, Sarah Butcher, and the father of three wonderful kids. There are no words to express what this loss means to his family, friends, his co-workers, and the WOWO listeners.
￼
Tony Samuel and I in the WOWO News/Talk 1190 AM & 107.5 FM studio with Charly
It has been an honor and a privilege to accompany Charly on his ‘Morning News’ segment over the years. Charly is a beacon of truth and courage to all that have known him and has always put the interests of his listeners and community first. Your legacy lives on, my friend.
Mueller Probe Has Not Found Collusion Evidence
In a survey released Tuesday, majorities of Republicans and Democrats all said that the special counsel should issue a report on allegations of connections between the Trump campaign and Moscow before voters head to the polls. I discussed with Stu Varney on his show Varney & Co. on Fox Business Network how 57 percent of Democratic respondents said the investigation should end before voting in November, compared to 72 percent of Republicans. Overall, 2/3rds of all voters polled favored ending the investigation before the midterms. 
￼
The American people have spoken and are done with the antics and clear bias shown by the Mueller investigation. That is why I have continued to fight on behalf of all U.S. citizens with my Mueller Resolution which calls for the evidence of collusion within 30 days or to end this witch hunt against our President. The media and liberal elite have continued to turn a blind eye to the truth of this investigation, but the message is simple: there is no evidence of Russian collusion. It’s time to put up or shut up, Mr. Mueller.

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
As a child, I was branded with the words, ‘pre-existing condition’ after spending three months in the hospital. I was raised by my grandparents, and, when I got better, they looked for an insurance policy that would cover me in the future. 
However, because of my previous illness, they couldn’t find such a policy. Not from any insurer. Not at any price. Before the Affordable Care Act, families across Wisconsin often faced similar challenges, and many had to make an impossible choice between helping their child get better or going bankrupt. 
Now, the health care coverage and guaranteed protections that Wisconsinites depend on under the Affordable Care Act are once again under relentless partisan attacks. 
For Wisconsin families like the Schaumberg's in Seymour, this issue is deeply personal. 
Several years ago, Zoe Schaumberg was born with a congenital heart defect and had to have open-heart surgery at five days old. Her mother, Chelsey, is scared that the protections and care Zoe has today won’t be here tomorrow - so Chelsey joined me in Washington this week to share her family’s story and fight to keep the pre-existing protections in the Affordable Care Act.
>>> WATCH Chelsey advocate for her daughter Zoe and demand Congress protect those with pre-existing conditions 
Right now, the Trump administration’s latest act of sabotage will expand junk insurance plans that can deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and don’t have to cover essential services like prescription drugs, emergency room visits, and maternity care. 
That’s why I am leading an effort in the U. S. Senate to take action and stop this sabotage by forcing a vote on these junk plans. We cannot let the Trump administration rewrite the rules and jeopardize the guaranteed protections that families need. 
If you agree, please make your voices heard in support of my Senate resolution to force a vote on overturning the Trump administration’s expansion of junk insurance plans. 
Together, we have fought against efforts to repeal health care because no family should be forced to choose between helping a loved one get better or going bankrupt. Together, we must fight this latest act of health care sabotage – let’s say no to junk insurance plans and make sure Washington starts working for you to protect your health care and make it more affordable. 
Sincerely, 
￼ 
U.S. Senator for Wisconsin

Boozman Bulletin: Arkansas is Ag 
Agriculture is an economic driver for Arkansas. It accounts for nearly one-quarter of our state’s economic activity, making it Arkansas’s largest industry. This is one of the reasons I serve on the Senate Agriculture Committee and why I annually travel across the state talking with farmers, ranchers and producers. We all have a responsibility to protect and promote this industry and the communities it supports.
This year it was particularly important as we are in the process of passing the 2018 Farm Bill. Having input directly from producers is vital to ensuring the legislation meets the needs of our agriculture community. Earlier this month, I was selected to serve on the Farm Bill conference committee. Senate and House members on the committee will reconcile the differences in the Farm Bill legislation passed by the two chambers. 
I enjoyed spending time and visiting with the hardworking Arkansans who support our agriculture industry and feed and clothe the world. Here are some of the highlights.
Students and staff at the Don Tyson Center for Agricultural Sciences at the University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture - Extension (UAEX) are doing important ag-related research that informs the industry and helps increase productivity and efficiency. 
￼ 
The Morgan family has operated its Johnson County peach farm since 1876. We visited Peach Pickin' Paradise to support family farms and a popular destination for peach lovers. 
￼ 
The DeSalvo family operates Big D Ranch in Center Ridge. The cattle ranch specializes in the development of registered Ultrablack Bulls and Heifers. Our cattle ranchers put out a safe and affordable product that can compete with anybody in the world. I appreciated hearing from members of the Arkansas Cattlemen’s Association about their thoughts and questions on issues that impact their industry like the Farm Bill, fair trade and regulatory reform.
￼ 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Chris Giancarlo joined our tour for one day. Since much of the work the CFTC does involves the agriculture industry, providing him with an opportunity to see Arkansas's industry and interact with farmers and producers will help him and the entire commission be better informed about regulations and decisions involving agriculture. 
￼ 
Barnhill Orchards in Lonoke is a veteran-owned fruit and vegetable farm that has been in operation since 1980. The orchard is a family business.
￼ 
This antique tractor on the Davis Farm in Stuttgart is a reminder of how long Arkansans have been farming the land. 
￼ 
Students and staff at the University of Arkansas at Monticello School of Forestry and Natural Resources are conducting research to counter invasive species and enhance land management practices through the use of new technology. I got a firsthand look at what they're working on. Their research will improve forestry practices in our state and beyond. 
￼ 
See what other Arkansans we visited during the 2018 Ag Tour using #ARisAg on Twitter or by visiting my Facebook page.  
 

Quick Takes: 
	•	Advocating for Expanded Benefits for Blue Water Navy Veterans: The Senate Veterans Affairs (VA) Committee recently examined legislation to expand the benefit eligibility for veterans who were exposed to the chemical Agent Orange during their military service in Vietnam. I’m pleased that the House of Representatives passed legislation to compensate this group of veterans and I am encouraged by this momentum in the Senate.   
	•	Recruiting and Retaining VA Physicians: The VA has long struggled to recruit and retain highly qualified physicians. That’s why I introduced the VA Hiring Enhancement Act to change that trend and level the competitive playing field for the VA.   
	•	Preparing Arkansas’s Workforce for 21st Century Jobs: Congress recently passed the reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education (CTE) Act and President Donald Trump signed it into law. Updating this law will help ensure our state is offering the training and education necessary for Arkansans to learn the skills that meet the needs of Arkansas industries to help our workforce thrive.   
	•	Helping Student Veterans Learn and Succeed: Student veterans have access to additional benefits this school year as the VA continues implementing reforms to education benefits. I’m pleased to support expanded benefits and eliminate unintentional financial burdens for student veterans.
	•	Recognizing Arkansas Veterans: The ‘Salute to Veterans’ series honors the service and sacrifice of Arkansas veterans who served our nation in uniform. In the latest edition, I recognized Korean and Vietnam Wars veteran Pete Ross, who served in the Army and reenlisted to serve in the Air Force. Hear more about his military career here. His interview has been submitted to the Veterans History Project.   
	•	Connect on Social Media: Stay up to date with what I’m doing for Arkansans via social media. You can find me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Lewis talks small business growth
￼
Rep. Lewis at Small Business Roundtable in Eagan.


Dear Lindsey,
As your Congressman, it is my privilege to work for the prosperity of you and your neighbors in the Second District. Since coming to Congress, I have had the opportunity to work on multiple Republican pro-growth items that work to that end. 
This past week, I was able to join Administrator of the Small Business Administration, Linda McMahon, and numerous Minnesota business owners at a Roundtable to discuss the pro-growth agenda items that are benefiting small businesses in the Second District and across the state. Over 500,000 small businesses in Minnesota and their employees are enjoying increased take-home pay thanks to the lowered corporate tax rate, and Congress’ recent movement to reform the overly burdensome Dodd Frank regulations has led to increased access to capital. 
As our small businesses continue to thrive, they will be able to grow, create more jobs, and increase the pay and benefits of their hard-working employees. For example, 600 companies in the United States have already given pay raises, bonuses, 401(k) match increases, and more. In Minnesota alone, dozens of companies have given back to their workers, and Data Sales in Burnsville gave $1,000 bonuses to every employee!
Our historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed just over six months ago, is spurring economic and job growth nationwide. Since its enactment, over 1.5 million jobs have been created, and the employment-to-population ratio rose to the highest level since January 2009. Additionally, our real GDP grew at a rate of 4.1% this past quarter of 2018, showing that our nation’s economy is booming and supporting our country’s workers and small businesses. 
To continue supporting our country’s workforce, we discussed the need for investment in career and technical education (CTE). Developing our workforce’s, our students’, and our young people’s technical skills will help fill the jobs our nation’s employers are looking to fill. Expanding CTE programs will help bridge the skills gap in this country, continue to bring down the unemployment rate, and help businesses acquire the technically trained workers they need.
As I work on this and other issues, I always like to hear directly from you.  Please share any thoughts you may have through my website, and sign up for my e-mail newsletter for the latest updates from Washington, D.C. and around the district. You can also stay on top of my work by following my Facebook and Twitter pages. Please feel free to call my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-2271 or my local Burnsville office at 651-846-2120 with any comments or for assistance with a federal agency.

Sincerely,

NEWS FROM WASHINGTON AND ACROSS WEST TEXAS
Dear Friend, 
There is no place like West Texas and no better people than the good folks that call it home. As I took a ‘West Texas Road Trip’ in the western part of our district this week, I stopped in to chat about our shared vision for the future of America in Hale, Castro, and Parmer Counties. 
Addressing Unfair Trade Practices 
For too long, China has taken advantage of our trade policies, played by a different set of rules, and infringed on our intellectual property rights. Recently, two agriculture researchers from China were charged in connection with a U.S. rice technology theft attempt in 2013. Commenting on the charges, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue stated, “this is exactly why President Trump is right to stand up to China.” They cheat and will continue to do so unless something is done.
With China being a key international consumer of United States agriculture products, it is important we address their unfair practices with wisdom and calculation. Fortunately, with President Trump at the helm, we can and will remain atop the global economy. 
China largely depends on and needs our market more than we need theirs. The President is right to primarily target China with tariffs rather than the entire global trade community. That being said, I believe tariffs should only be used as a last resort and as long as there are retaliatory protections in place for our ag producers. While we all would rather have more trade than tariffs, I am confident that the President is using and will use them wisely.
Furthermore, we need to develop other markets and encourage more trade with our current trade allies like Canada and Mexico. The best way to address China is to do more free trade with Vietnam, Japan, and other countries in the Pacific Rim. See my full conversation with KIDY on the topic here. 
￼ 
Chipping Away 
Obamacare’s regulations and taxes have made health care costs skyrocket. In addition to the House passing several measures to provide relief from Obamacare’s burdensome effects, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is now allowing Americans to enroll in short-term, limited-duration (STLD) health plans that will give families more choice and access to affordable health care. In fact, some STLD plans offer premiums that are up to 70 percent lower than Obamacare plans.
I applaud this Administration for giving Americans the flexibility to choose health care plans that fit their needs, wants and budgets. Read AEI’s write-up here on the recent rule. 
Investing in Hardworking Americans 
Tax reform and regulatory relief are enabling job creators to invest more in their hardworking employees, and that can be seen right here in West Texas at Lubbock’s Home Depot. It was great to join Store Manager Michael Hernandez and District Manager Oscar De La Vega along with many of the location’s employees to discuss the impact of pro-growth policies. Congratulations especially to two employees, Roosevelt and Dan, for being recognized for their superior customer service. 
￼ 
Listening to Wise Insight 
I had the opportunity to visit with a few of our senior citizens over at Hillcrest Manor. They had some insightful thoughts to share during our afternoon discussion. They’ve seen a lot in their lifetime – I am grateful for their input.

Dear Lindsey, 
￼
I want to hear if your wages are keeping up with the cost of health care and other expenses 
As I travel across our region, whether it be in the supermarket aisle or on the job site, I always ask folks what’s on their mind and today I’m reaching out to do just that. Specifically, I’d like to hear from you regarding your concerns with wages, health care and the outrageous cost of prescription drugs. Throughout my time in Congress, I’ve always fought to protect our care, lower costs and increase wages because that’s what hardworking families across Illinois have earned. Like you, I believe that Congress needs to work for the people again, which is why I’ll continue to take on this fight with you. If you’re someone who has a story to tell, whether it be your experience with wages, a pre-existing condition or access to quality care, I’d like to hear it. Click here to share your story with me.

Introducing the Bipartisan APPRENTICE Act
￼
Co-chairing a meeting of the bipartisan Congressional Apprenticeship Caucus.

Having a prepared workforce with access to high-quality jobs is key to economic growth and a strong middle class. I, along with Congressman Brett Guthrie (KY-02), introduced the Accessing Professional Partnerships and Resources to Enable Necessary Training and Improve Career Education (APPRENTICE) Act. Congressman Guthrie and I serve as Co-Chairs of the Congressional Apprenticeship Caucus and as the Chair and Ranking Member, respectively, of the House Education and the Workforce Committee’s Higher Education and Workforce Development Subcommittee.

The APPRENTICE Act would establish a $50 million grant program to expand apprenticeships. Under the APPRENTICE Act, grants would be awarded to organizations who administer state- or federally-recognized apprenticeship programs. The funds could be used to train personnel who supervise and educate apprentices, to publicize quality apprenticeship programs, to review apprentice applications, and to align apprenticeship curricula with local Career and Technical Education programs.

Earlier this month, I joined Congressman Guthrie in holding the first-ever forum of the bipartisan Congressional Apprenticeship Caucus to explore the importance of raising awareness and expanding quality apprenticeship programs. 

Use the following links to learn more about the Congressional Apprenticeship Caucus or the APPRENTICE Act. 

House Passes Final Version of Defense Bill

The House passed the final version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), with language that I added directing the Navy to report on the impact of border sewage spills on our national security.  The Navy plans to build a $1 billion Navy SEAL training center, known as the coastal campus, down the strand near Imperial Beach. I also called for an assessment of how construction and future training at the site could be impacted.

In the NDAA, I secured the provisions regarding military childcare services, increasing healthcare opportunities for disabled veterans, retention of female servicemembers, prevention and prosecution of sexual assault in the military, mental health services, and GI Bill benefits, among others.
 
Introducing Bill to Fight Child Summer Hunger

Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) and I introduced a bill to tackle the silent crisis of child hunger impacting families during the summer months. During the academic year, millions of kids from low-income families are able to get free or reduced-priced meals at school. But when school lets out for the summer, many of those same kids lose access to regular meals. To address this challenge, the members introduced the Stop Child Summer Hunger Act, a bill that would provide an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) card to families with children eligible for free and reduced-price school meals.

You can read more about this issue on my website. 

Democracy Awards “Life in Congress” Winner
￼
Receiving the first-ever ""Life in Congress"" Democracy Award.  

I was honored to have won the first-ever Democracy Awards “Life in Congress” award for creating a positive and productive workplace environment.  The competitive award sponsored by the Congressional Management Foundation (CMF) recognizes Members of Congress for having established “both formal policies and informal cultures that enhance the work-life fit and professional development of their staffs.”  President and CEO of CMF, Bradford Fitch, said the award demonstrates that ""Rep. Davis has made a significant commitment to being the best public servant for her constituents in California.""

Cosponsored Legislation

H.R. 4022, Reach Every Mother and Child Act, a bipartisan bill to strengthen U.S. efforts to end preventable deaths of mothers, newborns, and young children around the world.  The bill would implement a strategic approach for providing foreign assistance in order to end preventable child and maternal deaths within a generation.

H.R. 6315, Jeanette Acosta Invest in Women’s Health Act of 2018, which would provide women with increased access to preventive and life-saving cancer screening.  The bill would provide grants to leading women’s health care providers who serve at-risk populations and play an outsized role in the prevention and detection of cancer.

Hosting U.S. - Russia Relations Forum
￼
Introducing the panel of speakers at the U.S. – Relations forum.

I hosted Understanding U.S. – Russia Relations: A Panel Discussion, at San Diego State University with experts from UCSD and SDSU.  This event was the second iteration of my ongoing Understanding Foreign Affairs speaker series. The experts spoke on a variety of topics including a history of U.S. – Russia relations, the Russian worldview, Putin’s international goals, election meddling, cybersecurity threats, and goals for future negotiations.  

I plan to host additional events concerning issues that constituents would like to learn more about.  Please sign up for my e-news or follow me on social media to get news on future events.  If you were unable to attend the U.S. – Russia Relations Forum, a recording of the event is available on my Facebook page.
  
 Town Hall 
￼
Speaking to constituents at Southwestern College   
During the August recess, I hosted a town hall meeting at Southwestern College in Chula Vista. The event, which was attended by over 150 constituents from across the 53rd district, was an opportunity for them to directly discuss their concerns and ask me questions about specific issues. This was the first town hall for many of these constituents, who attended in an effort to discuss current events and become more involved with the legislative process.  
I took questions ranging from healthcare, immigration, the National Defense Authorization Act, climate change, protecting the environment, and international relations. Many constituents shared their concerns with the Trump administration’s recent actions and policies and the need to protect the integrity of the 2018 midterm elections. 
The entire event can be seen on my Facebook page here.
 
Congratulating Service Academy Nominees
￼
Meeting with newly appointed military service academy students. 

One of the greatest privileges for a Member of Congress is to nominate worthy candidates to attend one of our nation’s great service academies.  The 53rd Congressional District always has many well-qualified candidates seeking a limited number of nominations.  

This year, seven of the students I nominated were offered and accepted an appointment to one of our prestigious military academies.  Four of the students will be attending the United States Naval Academy, two will be attending the United States Air Force Academy, and one will be attending the United States Military Academy at West Point.

I hosted a breakfast for the nominees and their families to celebrate these students as they embark on this next chapter in their lives.  The students arrived at their respective service academies in late June. 

Chamber of Commerce Congressional Luncheon
￼
San Diego's congressional delegation at the Chamber Luncheon.
 
I joined my colleagues, Representatives Scott Peters, Juan Vargas, and Darrell Issa, at the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce’s 14th Annual Congressional Luncheon.  The Chamber hosts this event annually as a way to ask San Diego’s Congressional delegation about the matters that hold the most significance to the San Diego region.  Each of the Representatives was asked a series of questions concerning immigration, the political atmosphere in DC, trade, and a number of other topics. 

2018 Health Champion Award
￼
Receiving the 2018 Health Champion Award from San Ysidro Health.

I was honored to be recognized by San Ysidro Health as one of their “2018 Health Champions.”  I am deeply appreciative of the critical work that community health centers do to provide health care for our most vulnerable populations. 

31st Annual Stand Down
￼
Listening to veterans' concerns at Stand Down in San Diego.

I spoke at the 31st Annual Stand Down, an annual event for homeless veterans hosted by Veterans Village of San Diego. The event brings together free service providers to assist veterans and help alleviate issues contributing to their homelessness. 

I met personally with women veterans to listen to their stories and learn about how Congress can help address their concerns. I feel strongly that we must support and honor the veterans who have sacrificed for our freedom.

PREPARING FOR THE 2019 TAX SEASON
 A July 2018 report from the Government Accountability Office showed that about 21 percent of taxpayers, or about 30 million people, aren’t withholding enough taxes from their pay this year. Tax withholding tables have been updated to reflect the Republican tax legislation that was passed at the end of 2017. 
Click here for a few tips for how to review your withholdings to make sure you’re prepared for the 2019 tax season.  

BETTER UNDERSTANDING SPACE WEATHER
 In July, I successfully advanced legislation that will expand the scientific understanding and forecasting of space weather. This legislation will better coordinate federal research investments with our operational forecasters who provide warnings to those impacted by weather events.
Space weather is the naturally occurring variations in the space environment between the sun and the Earth, and space weather events can cause great damage to our infrastructure and our economy.  
￼
I look forward to working with my colleagues in both the House and Senate to secure final passage of this bill.

8/16/18 16:30,35-year high small business optimism," 
￼ 
 

August 16, 2018
 
Dear Friends, 
I hope you're having a wonderful week. Let's get right to the latest in Wisconsin and Washington...including major news about the optimism of America's small businesses! 
35-Year High For Small Business Optimism 
Because of our growing economy, small businesses are flourishing and optimistic! In July, small business optimism reached a 35-year high. Additionally, according to the survey, ""Records were set for job creation plans. A seasonally-adjusted net 23 percent of businesses are planning to create new jobs, while 37 percent of business owners said they had job openings that they could not fill in July."" 
Click HERE or the image below to celebrate the good economic news with a ""like"" and share on Facebook!

(And for those of you looking for the original source of the survey, click HERE!) 
Internship Opportunities In Wisconsin 
Attention college students or recent grads: my Hudson and Wausau offices are now accepting applications for fall internships. It's a great way to gain great experience while helping your community. Apply today!
 Click HERE or the image below for more information.
￼ 
 Our Economy Continues To Grow 
Thanks to our pro-growth policies like overhauling the tax code and letting families keep more of their hard-earned money, or instituting smart regulations that encourage small businesses to thrive, our economy is booming. And for the first time ever, there are more jobs available than unemployed workers to fill them. 
No one should be left on the sidelines in this modern economy, but that means that we need the right workforce development system to connect people to the right skills and training to succeed.  
That's why I recently spoke with OEM Fabricators and the National Association of Manufacturers in Woodville about the need for a 21st century workforce.

Dear Friends, 
 
We held an informative and excellent public discussion on the issues that Fourth District residents are most concerned about during our August 7th telephone town hall. We called 100,000 constituents to discuss the issues of the day. To listen to the live, 1-hour event, click HERE. The good news is if you missed our previous telephone town halls, I’ll be hosting another live access event soon. To sign up for future events, click HERE. 
 
I want to thank everyone who listened or participated in the call. I also want to thank constituents for leaving us questions and comments at the end of the town hall. We’re working hard now to answer each and every question. I know some of you experienced technical difficulties, and for that I apologize. In the future, we’ll try to minimize any technical difficulties by calling a smaller group of people. If you have any questions or concerns, or you’d like some assistance with a federal agency such as the IRS, VA, Medicare or Social Security, please call my district office at 770-987-2291. 
 
I also want to thank everyone my staff and I have met at events throughout the district during this August work period, including: participating in the Mandela Washington Fellowship Summit, several back-to-school events, meetings with local officials and constituents, and the successful telephone town hall. I’ve also held several meetings with local businesses and organizations, including a concrete plant, local broadcasters, citizens concerned about the environment and many, many more.

Dear Friend, 
                                
I look forward to August when I am in the district, spending time with hardworking Mississippians.  I enjoy driving across north Mississippi visiting with folks and exchanging ideas about how to make our communities better and safer.  It is what I hear from you that helps to move our state and nation forward.

As your Representative, I am always eager to listen to your thoughts and concerns.  This month, we have sat down with residents in Lee, Lowndes, Clay, Calhoun, Prentiss, Tishomingo, Itawamba, and Monroe counties.  Many more miles lie ahead as our work in the district continues.
                                
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT

President Donald Trump has signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019.  This legislation will help us to achieve our goals to rebuild America's military, provide for our service members and their families, and take better care of veterans.  It is vital our men and women in uniform have the support they need to protect our nation.  Also included in the NDAA is a much-needed pay raise - the biggest our troops have received in nearly a decade. 

￼

This legislation provides for better training at a time when there have been more lives lost to training accidents than in combat.  We owe our service members the best tools available if we are going to ask them to risk their lives to protect our nation at home and across the globe.  To read more about what steps we are taking to restore defense readiness, please click on the link.  


NATIONAL PURPLE HEART DAY

America recognizes National Purple Heart Day on August 7.  This day is set aside to honor the men and women who have lost their lives on the battlefield and to all those who have been wounded in combat.

Chester Starks, an Oxford native, joined the U.S. Army in 1961.  Mr. Starks told his mother that he wanted a career in the military.  During the Vietnam War, he was wounded three times.  Mr. Starks was awarded the Purple Heart.  Mr. Starks proudly served seven years in the U.S. Army.  ""Service for my country was an honor,"" Mr. Starks said.  ""That is the reason I decided to do it.""  

￼

Leona Sally Starks, Mr. Starks' wife, said he has made their family proud.  ""On a scale from one to ten, I would give him a ten,"" Mrs. Starks said.  ""The family and I are proud that he served and especially glad that he came home safe and sound.""  Mr. and Mrs. Starks have four children, 18 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.
                                           
These days, Mr. Starks divides his time between family and his fellow veterans.  Mr. Starks is the Lafayette County Veteran's Service Officer.  We are grateful for Mr. Starks' service in war and peace. 
                                                                            

CAFB CHANGE OF COMMAND

Welcome to Colonel Samantha Weeks who recently assumed command of the 14th Flying Training Wing at Columbus Air Force Base.  After serving two years as commander, Colonel Douglas Gosney relinquished command to Col. Weeks during a ceremony held on August 6.  As commander of the 14th FTW, Col. Weeks will lead the 14th Operations Group, 14th Mission Support Group and the 14th Medical Group.  Col. Weeks is the former commander for the 57th Adversary Tactics Group at Nellis AFB, Nevada.

￼

It was an honor to witness the change of command and to bid farewell to Col. Gosney who is retiring from the Air Force.  Col. Gosney proudly served our nation in the U.S. Air Force for 23 years.  Col. Gosney's dedication to producing some of the finest pilots in the world is an invaluable contribution to America's defense readiness capabilities.  
                                            

MASTER-BILT EXPANDING IN NEW ALBANY

This is an exciting time for Mississippi and our nation. The surging economy is strengthening consumer confidence.  More companies are investing in their operations and our workforce.

￼

Master-Bilt recently announced plans to invest $1 million at their refrigerated cabinet factory in New Albany.  Standex International, Master-Bilt's parent company, is relocating the production of refrigerated cabinets from Hudson, Wisconsin, to New Albany.  This move will create 30 jobs.  Currently, Master-Bilt employs a total of 425 people at their two facilities in New Albany.  Tom Machingo, Vice President of Operations, said the company's relationship with Mississippi has always been a good one.  ""We are excited,"" Tom said.  ""This project will enable us to build a better product.""

Congressman Flores Seeks Nominations for 2018 
TX-17 Congressional Veteran Commendation

 
U.S. Representative Bill Flores (R-Texas) is seeking nominations for the 2018 TX-17 Congressional Veteran Commendation, a special tribute to honor the military and community service of local veterans on Veterans Day.

“Our congressional district is home to tens of thousands of veterans. In addition to serving our nation, many of these veterans also serve our local communities. Their selfless service is admirable and worthy of special recognition and distinction. Honoring deserving veterans with the TX-17 Congressional Veteran Commendation on Veterans Day has become a time-honored tradition,” Congressman Flores said.  “For the seventh year in a row, I am looking forward to reviewing the nominations made by members of our community and recognizing more veterans for their exceptional service. It is important that we take the time to recognize the sacrifices our military men and women have made for our freedom and liberties, as well as for our local communities.”

The TX-17 Congressional Veteran Commendation was created by Congressman Flores in 2012 to honor and recognize distinguished veterans of the 17th Congressional District of Texas. Nominations for the commendation come from the community. To be eligible for nomination, veterans must currently reside in the 17th Congressional District and serve both our nation and our communities honorably during their military and post-military careers.

This year’s recipients will be announced on Veterans Day, November 11, 2018. Ceremonies to honor the recipients will be announced at a later date.

For more information regarding the commendation and to nominate a veteran visit Flores.house.gov. The submission deadline for nominations is Wednesday, October 31, 2018.

Beatty Recognizes Importance of National Health Center Week
This week, from August 12th-18th, is National Health Center Week, celebrating our nation’s health centers and recognizing their important role in providing care to countless American families. To mark the occasion, U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) issued the following statement:
“Our community health centers are a vital component of America’s healthcare system. Community health centers provide affordable, high-quality healthcare to underserved communities—regardless of one’s ability to pay—while at the same time saving nearly $24 billion each year by reducing unnecessary hospitalizations or emergency room visits. With this in mind, I salute our community health centers and their staff for a job well done, and I will continue to fight in Congress for greater federal support.”  
                                  ￼ Congresswoman Beatty is a longtime supporter of community health centers.

ICYMI: Congress is Closing the Skills Gap
Lately, there's been no shortage of good news about the American economy. Just a few weeks ago, we saw the economy grow at its fastest pace in nearly four years. Then, we learned worker pay and benefits rose to the highest level in a decade. Retail sales are rising, worker productivity is the strongest it has been in three years, and let's not forget that we are experiencing near-record consumer confidence and record small business optimism. 
In fact, right now our economy actually has more jobs available than job seekers. Congressman Ryan discussed this ""new, sort of good"" problem at a recent House Republican Leadership press conference after completing a tour of several manufacturing businesses: ""One thing I heard about is the need for more workers and especially workers with the right skills…we have jobs, but we need workers with skills to fill those jobs."" 
This isn't just a problem facing businesses in the midwest. Congressman Ryan has heard about the need for workforce development across the country, including at countless visits to First District businesses. The bottom line is: our education system is not properly equipped to help people adjust to this changing economy. 
That's why Republicans have been working hard to make sure Americans have the skills they need to fill the jobs of the 21st century. Just last month, the House passed the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, which is a critical piece of our Better Way agenda. By enhancing skills training, refocusing programs on student outcomes, and providing funding and flexibility to promote career and technical education at a state level, this bipartisan bill takes tremendous steps to help close the skills gap, and is now the law of the land.  
But the federal government doesn't move at the speed of our ever-changing workforce, and can't always regulate changes to prepare students for jobs in different regions across the country. That's why the respect for local solutions, like partnerships between companies and local schools, is now more pressing than ever. 
For example, take the partnership between Foxconn and Gateway Technical College. In his address to The Economic Club of Washington, D.C., Congressman Ryan discussed their shared efforts to develop a special curriculum designed to ensure workers have the skills Foxconn needs for the thousands of good-paying, high-skilled jobs they will create. Gateway Technical College is even building a new campus right next to Foxconn to train this workforce. 
This isn't the only example of these types of partnerships in Wisconsin's First District. Last year, the congressman toured Allis-Roller to learn about how they support local education initiatives and help high school and college students gain the skills they need to benefit in future manufacturing careers. He also visited New Berlin High School's career learning facilities designed to prepare students to be ""lifelong learners,"" in addition to Elkhorn Area High School's Technical Education Department, where he met with students and instructors to learn how they use training and equipment to prepare students for manufacturing and trade careers. 
These are just a few of the many businesses and schools coming up with innovative ideas to tackle this issue head on. We can't expect to fix 21st-century problems with 20th-century tools, and with recently expanded resources for these programs, this is exactly the kind of work we hope to see more of across Wisconsin, and the country. Workers are better off now because of House Republican policies, and with all this good economic news, there's no better time to ensure Americans have the skills they need to climb the ladder of opportunity.

Dear Friend, 
It's been an incredible week seeing several important projects become a reality in South and West Texas. Take a look:  
Working hard to support our nation's energy sector is a way of life for Texans, but folks often forget that energy security is vital for our national security. My thanks to Atlas Sand for showing me around your new North Plant in Kermit this week.  
￼ 
Great things are coming to Cyber City, USA! The San Antonio River Foundation, GhostWire Cyber Defense Academy and Toyota's new partnership allows local students to learn valuable skills that will prove useful in today's 21st century workforce. Glad to be able to come talk to a few of their students this week! 
￼ 
Marathon has for far too long had to rely on an old, unreliable wastewater collection system that causes serious public health risks across the community. Proud to have supported a grant for $1.55 Million to fix this critical issue and attend the initiation ceremony for the project this week. 
￼ 
Our nation is home to nearly 1.9 million female veterans and this number is expected to double by 2045. I'm proud to represent organizations like the Pink Berets in Boerne who care for our female veterans. Learn more here.  
￼ 
It was great to speak to the cadets at Midland College's Williams Regional Technical Training Center Law Enforcement Academy in Fort Stockton about my experience gathering intelligence as an undercover officer in the CIA. I have no doubt these smart folks will do an incredible job keeping West Texans safe as peace officers.  
￼ 
Project QUEST and the Open Cloud Academy's cybersecurity training bootcamp in San Antonio will allow veterans to smoothly transition into meaningful jobs that allow them to continue to protect our nation against global threats. Learn more in the Rivard Report, here.  
￼ 
As always, please don't hesitate to reach out to my office with any questions or concerns. For further updates on my work for you, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube at @HurdontheHill.

8/16/18 9:12,Important For Tomorrow,"News from Congressman Brian Mast
Lindsey - 
Tomorrow is a big day: at my request, the Army Corps, South Florida Water Management District, the Department of the Interior and others will be in town to discuss strategies to stop discharges.
All the info you need is below and the event is open to everyone. I just wanted to make sure you didn't miss this opportunity for our community to have their voice heard! 
Thanks! Brian

WORKING GROUP TO STOP DISCHARGES
Lindsey - 
At the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force meeting last month I testified about the need to alter dry season water management strategies to prevent the need for discharges during the wet season. Lowering water levels during the dry season would mitigate the need for discharges immediately and without needing to spend a single additional dollar of taxpayer money. 
The truth is that water is being held on Lake Okeechobee not just as it relates to risk management but as it relates to the benefit of a number of other entities to the detriment of an epicenter of population. This issue absolutely needs to be addressed in the short term because it is an emergency situation of health and welfare. 
At that meeting, Task Force Chairwoman Susan Combs committed to creating a sub-working group to examine dry season water management strategies. THIS FRIDAY, we're holding that working group with federal, state and local officials to advocate for changes in dry season water management to prevent the need for devastating discharges that have been destroying the Treasure Coast. 
Our working group on Friday is open to everybody, so please come and share with your neighbors who are as concerned about our community's destruction as we are. Here's the info you need:
Friday, August 17th 11:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.

8/15/18 21:17,News from Congresswoman Roybal-Allard,"￼ 
  

Dear Friend,

I'm excited to share some highlights of my recent work in Congress and our communities!  I hope you find them informative.  And if you haven't followed me yet on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, be sure to do so today.  See the online version of this newsletter here.


Working to Keep Families Together:

￼
Visiting East LA's Nuevo Amanecer Latino Children’s Services, which serves immigrant children separated from their families by the Trump Administration's cruel immigration policies.  I'm joined by Congresswomen Grace Napolitano (left) and Judy Chu (right).

Like you, I've been horrified by the Trump administration's separation of immigrant children from their parents at our border.  Tearing apart these families inflicts trauma on the children that is nothing short of child abuse. And contrary to President Trump's lies, there was no law requiring him to separate these families.  It was his decision and his alone.  When he came to the U.S. Capitol, I joined with Congressional Hispanic Caucus colleagues to confront him, to his face, about his inhumane family separation policy.

I've visited facilities in East LA and at America's southern border to see firsthand how these immigrant children and families are being treated.  I've heard from children who said Homeland Security officials had told them their parents had abandoned them.  Immigrant moms described the heartbreak and terror of being separated from their kids without warning and without any knowledge of where their kids were, or whether they'd ever be reunited.  Some moms were told they'd never see their kids again.  At one facility, I watched the emotional reunions of families who had been torn apart by our government.  To see those separated parents and children finally reunited was a crushing reminder that they NEVER should have been separated in the first place.

As ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, I am committed to fighting Donald Trump's zero-humanity immigration policies with every resource at my disposal.  I won a recent victory when the Appropriations Committee approved my bipartisan amendment adding $7 million to fund the Family Case Management Pilot Program, a highly successful – and far cheaper – alternative to detention.  The amendment also adds much-needed funding for mental health care for children and families at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities.

In addition, as co-chair of the Women's Working Group on Immigration Reform, I've co-hosted forums on Capitol Hill where my House Democratic colleagues and I have spoken with experts about the trauma children face when separated from their parents, how we can help these children, and how we can work to reunite their families.  (You can see the videos of those forums here and here.) 

I will keep working to make sure these children are well cared for, I will keep advocating for their swift reunion with their families, and I will keep speaking out for a humane immigration system that keeps families together and ends family detention.


Celebrating Our Businesses and Our Communities:

￼
Cutting the ribbon at the grand opening of Downey's Barriles RestoBar.

I joined in the grand opening of the Barriles RestoBar in Downey.  Cutting the ribbon was a lot of fun, and getting to try the food was even better!  Congratulations to owners Mario Trujillo and Fernando Vasquez on a successful opening.

In Bell Gardens, I helped honor retiring Police Chief Robert E. Barnes and celebrated his impressive 30-year career in law enforcement, including his eight years as Chief.  I presented him with a Certificate of Congressional Recognition saluting his outstanding dedication to ensuring the safety of the Bell Gardens community.


Supporting Affordable Housing:

LA County is facing a housing affordability crisis.  That is why I was so excited to help announce that the Federal Home Loan Bank San Francisco awarded a $1.2 million Affordable Housing Program grant to bring 50 new units of permanent supportive housing to our 40th Congressional District, at Residences on Main in South LA.  This new housing will help families and chronically homeless transition-aged youth move out of homelessness and build independent, healthy lives.


Fighting for the Just and Humane Treatment of Immigrants and Refugees:

￼
Leading the Democratic side at the markup of the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill.

As ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security (DHS) Appropriations Subcommittee, I spoke out against the Republicans' DHS Appropriations bill.  Its $5 billion in border wall funding was unjustifiable and outweighed the good aspects of the bill – there were many more urgent priorities we should have funded.  I also opposed its support of the Trump Administration's vast expansion of immigration enforcement activities in the U.S. interior.  Those ill-advised interior enforcement efforts will take our government's focus away from truly dangerous criminals, and will instill panic and confusion in communities across America, including in our 40th Congressional District.  Please know I will keep working to secure a sensible DHS Appropriations bill as this year's appropriations process continues.

I have been outraged by reports that multiple pregnant women in ICE and CBP custody were shackled and denied appropriate medical care.  No pregnant woman should be detained in a facility that lacks adequate medical care, or where conditions may endanger her unborn child.  That is why I have written a letter with Rep. Pramila Jayapal asking DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen for details about the pregnant women held by ICE and CBP.  I also supported Rep. Barbara Lee's amendment to stop ICE from detaining pregnant women except in extraordinary circumstances.  Unfortunately, her amendment was defeated by the Appropriations Committee majority.

Rep. Jayapal and I have also written a letter to FBI Director Chris Wray urging a thorough, transparent, and just FBI investigation of the Border Patrol’s killing of Guatemalan immigrant Claudia Patricia Gómez González.  The FBI has sent us a letter replying that the three Guatemalan witnesses to the shooting are in detention and are connected with the Guatemalan Consulate.  As the investigation of Ms. Gómez’s tragic death continues to unfold, I will keep pressing for this case to be handled fairly and openly.

Republicans opposed my effort in the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations markup to stop the Office of Refugee Resettlement from sharing info with DHS that would let them start deportation proceedings against sponsors of unaccompanied kids.  The government simply should not take actions that hurt the children in its care and delay their reunification with their families.

I discussed immigration policy with a group from the National TPS Alliance, including children of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders, as well as members of the Central American Resource Center (CARECEN-LA).  Terminating TPS puts people in harm’s way, and is a recipe for ensuring that the flow of asylum seekers to the U.S. only increases.  Recently, I supported an Appropriations Committee amendment from Rep. Nita Lowey to ensure that America's TPS holders can stay here, work here, and keep strengthening our country.  Unfortunately, the committee Republicans opposed this amendment.


Promoting Good Health for All Americans:

Given the reports that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has accepted money from the alcohol industry, I'm very pleased that NIH is shutting down its contentious study on the benefits of alcohol use.  I've been urging NIH to explain these reports, including in my questioning of the NIH director earlier this year.  Shutting down this study is a crucial step in protecting the integrity of NIH's health research process.

I introduced amendments to the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill to increase funding for Advanced Education Nursing grants (which help nurses get training in advanced practices and lead to patients getting better health care access at a lower cost) and to restore funds for the Health Careers Opportunity Program (which will help minority and disadvantaged youth pursue careers as health professionals and help improve U.S. public health).  Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole has committed to working with me to secure these funds.


Supporting Our Students and Our Schools:

￼
With new CA-40 West Point appointees Reynaldo Gonzalez-Romero (second from left) and Justin Vargas (second from right). Reynaldo’s mother Bertha Romero is at left and Justin’s mother Laura Perez is at right.

Congratulations to new West Point appointees Reynaldo Gonzalez-Romero of Paramount and Justin Vargas of Bell!  As their congresswoman, I was honored to nominate these two St. John Bosco High School alums to help represent our 40th Congressional District at our nation’s Military Academy.  I welcomed them and their mothers to my District Office, where I presented these remarkable young men with Certificates of Special Congressional Recognition.

If you will be a high school senior in the 2018-19 school year and are interested in attending one of our nation's service academies, you can follow in Reynaldo and Justin's footsteps and apply for a nomination from me.  You must be a U.S. citizen and live in California’s 40th Congressional District.  Click here for more information.  And I'm pleased to announce that my 2018 U.S. Service Academies Workshop will be held on September 22, 2018, at Downey City Hall, from 9:00-10:30 AM.  Read more about this upcoming workshop here.

It was great to greet Paramount's Noah Endo, the 2018 Lucille Roybal-Allard Student Art Competition winner, at the U.S. Capitol!  His winning artwork, a piece in color pencil, marker, and pen titled ""A Growing Threat,"" is on exhibit at the Capitol for a year alongside student art from across America.  I'm so glad that Noah and his mother, Isela Preciado, could be in Washington, DC for the art exhibit's opening.

Student loan debt is a full-blown crisis – and as the cost of college rises, Pell Grants’ purchasing power goes down.  I offered an amendment to the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill to increase the maximum Pell Grant to match inflation and help Americans make ends meet.  Sadly, the GOP majority opposed my amendment.

In my speech at Montebello Unified School District’s first Educational Equality Conference, I highlighted my fight to support our LGBTQ and immigrant communities, and assured the audience that I will keep opposing policies that demean and hurt our families.  I was honored to be recognized at the conference for my advocacy, and my conversations with the conference’s youth and parents left me energized.  It is great to see so many members of our communities coming to conferences like this one to obtain educational resources and support.

I helped recognize parent leaders at Maywood Academy High School during an Appreciation Event in their honor.  These parents have been actively engaged in the school’s Parent Center, and have participated in school committees such as the School Site Council and the PTA.  The parents’ dedication and exceptional service shows how committed they are to helping their children receive a meaningful education.  During my visit, I gratefully accepted a certificate of appreciation from the LA Unified School District (LAUSD) School Volunteer Program and from LAUSD Parent and Community Services.

On Capitol Hill, I welcomed a visit from some Downey education trailblazers: Leaders from Griffiths and Stauffer Middle Schools – which were being recognized in DC as National Forum Schools to Watch – and a Downey Unified School District delegation to cheer them on!


Standing Up for American Workers:

By a single vote, the Supreme Court has voted to weaken public sector unions by ending their collection of “fair share fees” for services they are legally required to provide to workers.  That will undermine the ability of public service workers like teachers, police officers, and firefighters to negotiate for decent pay and fair workplaces.  As your congresswoman, I'm fighting to strengthen our workers, and that means keeping our unions strong.

I am disgusted by the news of years-long sexual harassment at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  It is critical that FEMA continue its investigation, and that whistleblowers are protected.  As the top Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee that funds FEMA, I will do all I can to ensure this investigation is thorough and uncompromising, and I will fight for reforms that correct this toxic environment.


Preserving America's Security:

I was very disappointed the Appropriations Committee voted down my amendment that would provide the Coast Guard with $750 million for the polar icebreaker program, paid for by reducing the Homeland Security Appropriations bill’s unjustifiable border wall funding.  Let’s be clear: Separating families at the border is NOT about national security, but funding for polar icebreakers IS!  Right now, America has a total of two icebreakers, while Russia has 27 (and more under construction).  We simply cannot afford to delay any longer.


Advocating for the Humane Treatment of Animals:

I’m working with colleagues from both parties on a new effort to save cats, dogs and monkeys that survive experiments in government labs.  Scientists and animal welfare advocates agree that these animals deserve a second chance.

August 15, 2018

Aloha,

Yesterday, President Trump signed legislation I wrote with Senator James Risch (R-Idaho) to provide a consistent set of resources for small businesses to protect themselves from cybersecurity threats.  Small businesses do not have the same resources as larger ones and that makes them easier targets for hackers.

Last week, I participated in a naturalization ceremony with 111 people from 26 countries including the Philippines, Japan, and Cameroon.  I also joined the Hawai‘i Job Corps Center in Waimanalo to celebrate the 37 members of their graduating class.  I was inspired by all of their dedication, and I look forward to seeing the ways they contribute to our state and country.

I am also pleased that the Senate unanimously confirmed Jill Otake to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawai‘i.  I was proud to support her nomination to the federal bench, and she will serve the court and our state with integrity.

As always, please contact my office in D.C. or Hawai‘i if there is anything we can do. We are here to help.

Mahalo,

Brian Schatz
United States Senator



Protecting Small Businesses
Yesterday, President Trump signed the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Small Business Cybersecurity Act, legislation authored by Senator Schatz and James Risch (R-Idaho). The bipartisan bill will provide a consistent set of resources for small businesses to best protect their digital assets from cybersecurity threats. Small businesses are a pillar of the American economy and make up more than half of all jobs in the United States. But these businesses have also become a major target for cyberattacks.  “As businesses rely more and more on the internet to run efficiently and reach more customers, they will continue to be vulnerable to cyberattacks. But while big businesses have the resources to protect themselves, small businesses do not, and that’s exactly what makes them an easy target for hackers,” said Senator Schatz, lead Democrat on the Commerce Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet. “This new law will give small businesses the tools to firm up their cybersecurity infrastructure and fight online attacks.”
In addition to Schatz and Risch, co-sponsors of the bill include U.S. Senators John Thune (R-S.D.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).
In 2014, the Senate unanimously passed the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014, which codified the industry-led process for the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, a comprehensive voluntary guide for organizations and businesses to better manage and reduce cybersecurity risks. While this framework continues to play a key role in improving the cyber resilience of the United States, additional coordinated resources are necessary to improve the ability of small businesses to use the framework. The legislation, formerly known as the MAIN STREET Cybersecurity Act, will ensure NIST considers the needs of small businesses as it updates the framework and provide simplified, consistent resources based on the NIST framework specifically for small businesses.

Enabling Telehealth
Senator Schatz released the following statement after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to move ahead with a $100 million telehealth pilot program. The Connected Care Pilot Program would expand broadband access for veterans and patients in low-income communities to connect them to telehealth services.   “I’ve seen firsthand how telemedicine can make it easier for patients to see their doctors, bring specialized care to more places, and literally save lives. I thank Commissioner Carr and the FCC for looking at new ways to extend the benefits of telehealth to more veterans and families who are still struggling to get the care they need,” said Senator Schatz, lead Democrat on the Senate Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation and the Internet.   Senator Schatz is the author of the CONNECT for Health Act, bipartisan legislation that would expand telehealth services in Medicare, improve care outcomes, make it easier for patients to connect with their health care providers, and help cut costs for patients and providers. Provisions in Senator Schatz’s bill have been included in comprehensive health care legislation.

Restoring Our Coastlines
Senator Schatz announced that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will award $231,660 to the Hawai‘i Wildlife Fund for a three-year project to remove 112 metric tons of abandoned fishing gear and marine debris from the coastlines of Hawai‘i Island, Kauai, Maui, and Lanai. 
“This funding will help these local organizations continue to preserve and restore one of our state’s most impressive and renowned resources – our coastlines,” said Senator Schatz, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.   With the help of the Kauai Chapter of the Surfrider Foundation and Pulama Lanai, this project will include weekly fishing net and large debris patrols along more remote stretches of coastline, as well as quarterly community-based marine cleanup events, to remove an expected 112 metric tons of debris. In all, about 300 fishing net and debris patrols and 39 community-based coastal cleanup events will take place on the four different islands. Fishing net bundles will be shipped to Oahu as contributions to NOAA's Nets-to-Energy program, which uses lost, abandoned, and discarded fishing nets to produce electricity. Recyclable content will be sorted and taken to appropriate facilities.   Located in Paia, the Hawai‘i Wildlife Fund is a non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation of Hawai‘i's native wildlife and ecosystems through research, education and advocacy.

Hi Lindsey – Like so many folks in our community, I’m very concerned about the wildfires burning throughout California. 

People have lost their lives and hundreds of homes have burned. Even under these terrible conditions, we’ve seen our heroic firefighters and first responders do an incredible job.

Perhaps you have friends or family who have been impacted as well. Thankfully, our district hasn’t been directly hit by wildfires – but the risk is still there. As a doctor, I know that in addition to the visible destruction, wildfires can take a physical and emotional toll on residents.

I wanted to send an update with resources and information to help you. 

Please feel free to forward this email along to anyone who may need it.

Recovery and relief: If you own property impacted by a wildfire, or know someone who does, the state of California and the federal government provide disaster assistance programs to help residents recover and rebuild. You can visit the links below to learn more.
• California Office of Emergency Services 
• DisasterAssistance.gov 


In Congress, I’ve consistently voted to provide disaster relief funding for those impacted by wildfires.

I also strongly supported a new bipartisan law, the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, that helps fix the broken “fire borrowing” process, where federal firefighters were forced to take money away from other crucial priorities just to cover the cost of putting out wildfires – even programs that helped prevent fires in the first place. We need to dedicate resources to both fight and prevent wildfires, but we also have to understand how our changing climate continues to exacerbate these events.

If you have any questions or would like to share your views, you’re always welcome to contact me.

It is an honor and privilege to serve you. 

Be well,

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Here in Wisconsin, our workers have helped sustain America’s security for generations, boasting a successful history of building ships for our nation’s defense. 
Today, hardworking Wisconsinites continue that tradition by working directly at the shipyard in Marinette building the Freedom-class Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), along with thousands of other skilled workers throughout the LCS supply chain in communities across our state. 
I am proud to champion Wisconsin workers and represent Wisconsin’s shipbuilding industry in the Senate. That is why I worked across party lines to authorize full funding for three LCS in the upcoming fiscal year. 
The LCS/Frigate program provides the Navy with the critical capabilities it needs to enhance its warfighting posture and meet the growing operational demands of our Combatant Commanders. As our Navy’s most affordable warship, the LCS also represents the best balance between capability and cost to American taxpayers. Not only is the LCS program essential to our national security, the program is also critical to revitalizing American manufacturing, strengthening the defense industrial base, and preserving Wisconsin jobs. 
To continue championing hardworking Wisconsinites and our manufacturing economy, I led bipartisan amendments in the fiscal year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to authorize full funding for the LCS program and support other critical Made in Wisconsin national security efforts. 
In addition to helping secure funding for three LCS, I successfully championed a bipartisan amendment to reject cuts to Oshkosh Defense’s Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) program, which supports manufacturing jobs at Oshkosh Defense and military vehicles made here in Wisconsin. Due to these efforts, both the LCS and JLTV programs were fully funded in the final NDAA legislation signed into law this week. 
I was proud to work across party lines in support of the LCS and JLTV programs, and look forward to continuing to champion our Made in Wisconsin workers and manufacturing economy in the Senate. 
Sincerely, 
￼ 
U.S. Senator for Wisconsin

Dear fellow South Carolinians,  Thank you for subscribing to my weekly e-newsletter, and please remember to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.  
Around the State Last week, I made five stops across South Carolina as part of my 46 county tour. I met a lot of great constituents in Calhoun, Lexington, Fairfield, Kershaw and Lancaster counties to discuss my Opportunity Zones legislation, tariffs, healthcare, affordable housing and more. Always great to talk with my bosses! ￼  ￼ 
Opportunity Tour: CO On Monday, I stopped in Aurora, Colorado as part of my national Opportunity Tour. There, I took part in a productive roundtable discussion with small business owners and Colorado Economic Development officials from the city of Aurora on how Opportunity Zones will revive distressed communities in their area. You can read more about my stop here.  ￼  ￼ 
National Purple Heart Day On August 7, 1782, George Washington created the Purple Heart Medal to honor those who were wounded or killed while serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. Last week, we recognized Purple Heart Day, and I would like to take a moment to honor all those who selflessly served this nation to protect our freedom. ￼ 
 
Sincerely, ￼  Tim

Congressman Al Green's Statement on Worthing High School 
(Houston, TX) - Congressman Al Green made the following statement regarding the school ratings rendered by the Texas Education Agency today during a HISD press conference at Worthing High School:  
“Evan E. Worthing High School has demonstrated that they are worthy of saving.  I stand with Worthing and the Sunnyside community as we continue to support the students. They have worked diligently on their academic accomplishments.  With the leadership of Houston Independent School District, Worthing has demonstrated that they are committed to their students, faculty, and staff, as well as the community, by proudly announcing their most recent achievements of meeting the academic standards.  
I believe that the new Texas Education Agency (TEA) ratings signal understanding of the hardships that many schools, students, and parents in Houston endured when Hurricane Harvey impacted our lives. Worthing High School and the surrounding community have continuously shown they can overcome adversity. This unyielding determination to succeed has been expressed with the TEA’s most recent ratings and demonstrates that Worthing is and always will be worthy of saving.”

Dear Friend, 

On Monday, the National Defense Authorization Act was signed into law by President Trump. The bill will give our troops and their families the biggest pay raise in nearly a decade and provides an upgrade to the equipment they depend on to fight against today’s global threats, including their ongoing counterterrorism efforts. We are thankful to the men and women whose dedication and sacrifice make our military the greatest fighting force in the world.

This past week I continued to travel throughout the district to meet with many of my constituents and hear concerns from health care providers and small business owners. 

District Visits
Wednesday I stopped by Crewe Medical Center where we discussed the burden of paperwork and how it could spell the end of small, patient-friendly healthcare. I will continue to fight to rollback overbearing regulations that hurt small medical practices.
     ￼

The Southern States Co-Op is serving our farmers in Burkeville and it was my privilege to get to visit. Thank you for the work you do for our agriculture community. 

                             ￼     ￼

                                       ￼

While I was in Nottoway County, I also attended the Livestock Auction and made a stop at the Cowpen Restaurant.

       ￼   ￼      ￼  
 
             ￼   ￼

It was my privilege to go on WSVS which has been broadcasting to Virginia communities since 1947. Thanks for having me on the show and the discussion of defense spending.

Friend- 
I always enjoy the opportunity to travel around our community to meet with constituents about the issues important to them and provide an update on my work in Congress. Here are a few highlights from some of our meetings this month:
  
 ￼ 
I met with Richard, Alexandria, and their mom Kathleen, to discuss the importance of funding and research for type 1 diabetes. They shared their own personal story and I thank them for their advocacy on behalf of those suffering from this disease. I am proud to support the Special Diabetes Program and increased funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), which conduct lifesaving research in hopes of finding a cure. As the newest member of the Congressional Diabetes Caucus, I will continue supporting legislation that increases diabetes research, education, and treatment efforts. 
  
￼ 
Bob, an Army Veteran who works on my district staff, presented a Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition to Colonel James Martin upon his retirement. Colonel Martin served as Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst Deputy Commander U.S Army Support Activity. JB MDL is our community’s largest employer, supporting 42,000 direct jobs and over 100,000 total jobs, and is our nation’s premier air mobility, training, and technology base. Thank you to Colonel Martin for his service to our country!   
  
 ￼ 
ShopRite of Burlington invited me to meet with their pharmacy department to discuss the opioid crisis and my role as co-chair of the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force. The opioid epidemic is devastating communities across the United States, as well as right here in South Jersey. It has been a top priority of mine to provide resources to help our community with treatment, prevention, and enforcement efforts. Recently, my bill, the SENIOR Communities Protection Act passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support. This legislation protects seniors from theft of their Medicare dollars and ensures they receive the medications they need, while empowering authorities to go after criminals who abuse Medicare to flood our communities with drugs.  
  
￼  
Jay, an Air Force veteran who works with my office through the Wounded Warrior Fellowship Program, visited A Thyme For All Seasons in Toms River to congratulate them for their success in our community. I spent my career growing a business and I am committed to supporting policies that help our businesses on Main Street prosper. Our economy continues to grow and strengthen due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and fewer burdensome federal regulations. We are seeing record high confidence among small business owners and rising wages for front line employees!  
 As always, please contact my office if we can help you in any way. For more information, visit my website: http://macarthur.house.gov.

Congresswoman Beatty Hosts Community Conversation Highlighting STEM Education
COLUMBUS, OH–Last night, U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) held a Community Conversation at St. Stephen’s Community House to discuss developments in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. More than 100 constituents attended the event, receiving an update about the positive impact of STEM in Central Ohio and talking with Beatty about related-issues and legislation, as well as other challenges facing Ohio’s Third Congressional District and the nation.   
The first segment of the Community Conversation featured a panel discussion of leading educators and practitioners working at the forefront of STEM education. Panelists included Congresswoman Beatty; Maxwell Slater, St. Stephen’s Community House Farm and Operations Manager; Toni Cunningham, Per Scholas Columbus Managing Director; Dr. Lisa Hinkelman, Ruling Our Experiences (ROX) Executive Director; and Mary Jane Pettigrew, Hamilton STEM Academy Vice-Principal.     
A lifelong champion of STEM education, Beatty spoke to the standing room only crowd of parents, stakeholders, advocates, and elected officials about its life-changing effects and her ongoing work to guarantee every student is well-versed in STEM.
“We need a highly trained workforce—hardworking individuals from all walks of life—ready for the jobs of tomorrow,” Beatty said at the Community Conversation. “This is essential to ensuring U.S. competitiveness and leadership in a rapidly changing global economy.” Beatty continued, “Unfortunately, our country is facing a massive shortage of workers skilled in these areas. To help fill the void, St. Stephen’s Community House, many other local nonprofits, and stakeholders are working overtime to equip more Central Ohioans with the much-needed tools, expertise, and education to succeed in the 21st Century, and I am working in Congress to make it a reality.”  
Beatty introduced the 21st Century STEM for Girls and Underrepresented Minorities Act,H.R. 3119, to expose more students to the STEM fields. If enacted into law, H.R. 3119would provide funding for local school districts to create the necessary infrastructure for enhanced STEM learning early in a student’s academic career. Federal funding would be used to improve professional development for teachers, strengthen outreach to parents, provide mentoring and tutoring programs, expand access to afterschool and summer programs that provide additional enrichment opportunities in STEM, and promote academic advice and assistance in high school course selection that encourages girls and minority-Americans to take advanced STEM classes and become STEM professionals.

These added resources are now available to the state so we can proactively protect life, property, and land.

Dear Friend, 
Meeting with Coloradans During the August State Work Period
Last week, I had the privilege of presenting the Congressional Badge of Bravery to Deputy Teri Javes from the Boulder County Sheriff's Office. The Congressional Badge of Bravery is awarded when an individual exhibits extraordinary bravery while protecting the lives of others, without regard for their own safety. Deputy Javes acted fearlessly and selflessly in September, 2016 when she was able to subdue an armed subject. It was an honor presenting this award to such a hero.

In Julesburg last week I attended the dedication of the Sedgwick County Veterans Memorial. At this dedication I had the fortunate opportunity to both tour the memorial and present a veteran who served our country bravely in WWII with a flag. 
￼ 
￼
Last Monday, I visited abandoned mine sites in Clear Creek County to see work done by Trout Unlimited to help improve water quality. Private organizations such as Trout Unlimited want to help in cleaning up watershed around abandoned mines but are being held back by threat of liability claims. Good Samaritan legislation would provide protection to private organizations wanting to improve water quality in Colorado.

In July, Denver International Airport began Phase 1 of its Great Hall project. While visiting the airport last week I toured the renovation project seeing the progress being made and was able to walk through the construction that will result in better security and an improved overall layout of the airport.  
Washington, D.C. cannot operate in a vacuum, and that’s why I’m always eager to meet with Coloradans and gain their input on a variety of issues. My discussions with Coloradans range from forest service operations, the USDA ARS water management and systems unit, to agriculture and water conservation. 
While traveling throughout the state, I was able to participate in an agriculture aviation and crop dusters roundtable, met with Morgan Community College, toured the recent weather damage across Brush, and visited the Hemp processing plant in Yuma. I’m fortunate to have had the opportunity to meet with so many different groups across the state, and I look forward to continuing to meet with Coloradans in the days ahead. 
Below I have included a few photos of my visits.

8/15/18 10:21,Small Businesses are Thriving,"￼ 


Hoosiers,  America's small businesses are more confident than ever. The National Federation of Independent Businesses just released their latest report stating that Main Street's performance over the last 21 months is unprecedented, which has translated to improved employment and investment spending, GDP growth, and record high economic optimism. Other good news from the report include:
	•	Businesses are setting records in terms of job creation and hiring. 
	•	Record levels of firms are reporting higher compensation - a clear indication that wages will be rising further.
	•	High expected return on real capital investments in plant and equipment. 
Through pro-growth tax reform and reducing burdensome and unaffordable regulations, I'm fighting to ensure that our small businesses, the backbone of our local economies, have the resources they need to grow, create jobs, and increase economic growth in our Indiana communities.  

Read the latest NFIB report here or a summary here. 

Be of good cheer,

8.14.18 Progress for Infrastructure Improvements in Virginia  
Dear Friend, 
After years of pushing for much-needed improvements to Virginia’s infrastructure, I’m pleased that we recently passed a bill in the Senate that would fund key transportation grants and help expand broadband access to rural communities in the Commonwealth.
Specifically, the legislation supports the Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) program, formerly known as “TIGER” grants. In the past, Virginia has used these grants for projects including the I-95 Express Lanes, I-564 connector from Norfolk International Terminals at the Port of Virginia, I-64 Delta Frames Bridges in Rockbridge County, and the Pulse bus-rapid transit system in Richmond.
The bill would also help fund a grant program administered by the Rural Utilities Service that brings critical services to some of the most rural, underserved areas in America. This program supports new or improved broadband access across rural areas and enables telecommunications providers to fill gaps where there is little or no broadband service. Broadband access has become a critical part of our basic economic infrastructure and is vital for job creation.
Read more about the bill here >>
Please know that I’ll keep being a strong advocate for smart investments in infrastructure that can create jobs and make daily life easier for you and your family.

Sincerely,
￼
Senator Tim Kaine

Dear Neighbor,
One of the many services our office provides is critical support for federal grants to pump resources into our communities for various projects to help people.
We provide organizations with letters of support and guide people to grants that may fit their project’s needs.   We care about providing crucial federal funds to improve our quality of life, safety and security. Advocating and securing funds to improve our neighborhoods boost jobs.  We recently announced:
	•	$150,000 grant to Corning Community College for the Manufacturing Technology Advancement Project. The college anticipates 50 current workers and trainees will obtain new employment or an enhanced position through this grant.
	•	$15,959 grant to Literacy Volunteers of Chautauqua County for the Expanding Adult Literacy in Jamestown Area project. This grant will prepare thirty workers for employment.
	•	$75,000 grant to the Community Care Network of Nichols to establish a volunteer transportation program project in Owego and Waverly. This program increases access for seniors and disabled individuals to medical services, local resources and community businesses.
It is our job to help the people and our communities in the 23rd Congressional District. By being the voice to secure federal funding, we are ensuring our communities grow and receive the financial help they deserve.
 Until next time,  Tom

In This Edition 
Upon returning home from Washington for the August district work period, I hosted a productive town hall in Long Beach, which over 600 people attended.  
Last week, I attended a field hearing in Sacramento regarding the status of the California High-Speed Rail Project. 
I had the pleasure of once again visiting the STARBASE classrooms at the Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos, where I learned about the “virtual reality room” that students will soon have access to.  
It was an honor to be briefed on the operations and mission of the 79th Theater Sustainment Command (TSC)—the second largest headquarters in the Army Reserve—which is stationed on the Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos 
In this edition of Alan’s Inbox, see my response to constituents who have contacted me to express their concerns regarding potential Russian interference in the 2018 midterm elections.   
Be sure to check out CongressU, where I explain the steps involved in funding the federal government each year, which include a presidential budget proposal, appropriations bills, and continuing resolutions.
Lastly, don’t forget to take this week’s poll in the right-hand column.

Hosting a Successful Town Hall in Long Beach  
Upon returning home from Washington for the August district work period, I hosted a successful town hall at Millikan High School in Long Beach, which over 600 people attended. We discussed important issues for the future of our nation including DACA and immigration reform, the future of the Affordable Care Act, the struggle to protect the environment and public lands, and a host of other issues that you, my constituents, raised. You can watch the full discussion by clicking the photo below.

Hearing an Update on the California High-Speed Rail Project 
Last week, I attended a field hearing in Sacramento organized by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee’s Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials. At the hearing, Members of Congress and the public were updated on the status of the California High-Speed Rail Project. As the chair of the Transportation and Housing Committee in the California State Senate from 2006-2010, I was involved in the rollout of the CA High Speed Rail shortly after the passage of Proposition 1A, which issued bonds for the project. I have long been a supporter of high-speed rail in California; however, I had early concerns about an apparent lack of adequate funding, as well as the starting point for construction of the project. 
My goal at this hearing was to get an update on the project, including efforts to secure funding, and to ensure that the project is progressing in a transparent fashion. After hearing the witnesses’ testimony, I asked the panel to clarify exactly how much money is currently available, and how much of the project can be completed with those dollars. I also raised concerns with the Rail Authority that Southern California is being left out of the conversation about how the project will proceed. I received assurances from the CA High Speed Rail Authority Chief Executive, Brian Kelly, that they will work with me to ensure that Southern California is brought into the conversation more frequently. 
I will continue to do what I can to ensure that this project is successful and that its benefits are felt not only in Northern California, but in Southern California as well.

Visiting the STARBASE Classroom in Los Alamitos 
Last week I had the pleasure of once again visiting the STARBASE classrooms the Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos. STARBASE is a wonderful Department of Defense program that teaches critical Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) skills to 5th grade students at its more than sixty nationwide locations. The academies aim to serve students who are historically underrepresented in STEM—such as girls and lower-income students of color—by engaging them in an inquiry-based, hands-on curriculum.
During my visit, I was given a preview of the program’s “virtual reality room,” which will soon be under construction at STARBASE. Once completed, the room will allow students to experience what it would feel like to walk on the moon, and to take a closer look at the organs inside the human body, among other virtual reality experiences. I was also shown the new interactive tools that STARBASE teachers are using to teach physics and chemistry. I’m proud to be a champion in Congress of this wonderful program, and I am already looking forward to my next visit.

Congressman Lowenthal with STARBASE teachers in Los Alamitos
Visiting the Theater Sustainment Command at  the Los Alamitos JFTB 
Last week, it was an honor to be briefed on the operations and mission of the 79th Theater Sustainment Command (TSC)—the second largest headquarters in the Army Reserve—which is stationed on the Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos and is under the command of Major General Mark Palzer. I also had the opportunity to speak with Major General Brian Alvin, Commanding General of the 63rd Mission Command. These TSCs provide essential support for base operations and facilitate the readiness training, mobilization, and deployment of America’s soldiers. It is an honor to represent in Congress a base that is so essential to our nation’s military readiness.   ￼   Congressman Lowenthal with California National Guard Generals MG Alvin and MG Palzer 
￼ 
Each week hundreds of constituents contact my office to share their views on a variety of topics. I have recently received many messages from constituents expressing their express their concerns regarding potential Russian interference in the 2018 midterm elections. Below is a portion of my response to those messages: 
“As your Representative in Congress, I believe that Russia actively meddled in the 2016 presidential election to undermine our democratic process, sow division amongst our citizens, and elevate their preferred candidate.  Regardless of one’s party affiliation, we must all come together as Americans to prevent this from ever happening again.     Despite what President Trump claims, our intelligence agencies have all reached a consensus on this matter and have warned against potential future election interference from Russia, especially for the 2018 midterms.  
California leads the country in voting systems security, implementing Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) Systems to record votes directly into a computers' memory, they are never connected to the internet or with each other, and they keep a physical paper trail to allow for full review and audit of the election results.  Further, while evidence shows that Russia tried to access CA voting systems in 2016, there is no evidence that they were successful, due to the protections and measures the State has implemented. 
To further protect the voters in California as well as to upgrade and secure voting systems across the country, I have cosponsored several pieces of legislation aimed at fortifying our election infrastructure.  I am a cosponsor of the Safeguarding Election Infrastructure Act, which allows for state and local election officials to get the needed security clearances, so federal agencies can share relevant intelligence and information needed to protect voting systems.  I am also a cosponsor of the Election Security Act, that protects elections for public office by providing financial support and enhanced security for the infrastructure used to carry out such elections.   
Additionally, I joined my colleagues in sending a letter to Election Assistance Commission requesting that the commission provide states with information on Congress’ intended uses for $380 million.  These funds, appropriated to the EAC, are to be distributed to states for upgrades to their election security.  Voters must be able to cast their ballots on election day knowing that their ballot is counted and that our elections are free, fair, and not vulnerable from interference.  Anything less would undermine the public’s trust, our institutions, and our democracy.  I will actively seek and advance legislation that empowers and protects every person’s fundamental right to vote.  Rest assured that I will continue to monitor this situation and protect our democracy.” 
If you have written in to me, please continue to do so. If you have not, I encourage you to share your views and concerns with me, as it is the best way for me to find out which issues you care most about.   You can find out how to contact me on my website by clicking here. 
￼ 
Proposed Budgets, Appropriations, and Continuing Resolutions   Each year the president releases a proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year. Once released, the proposed budget is given to Congress for review. Congress then creates several separate bills, called appropriations bills, which authorize government spending. These bills could be similar to, or completely different from what was in the President’s proposed budget.
If Congress cannot agree to spending levels in their appropriations bills, they usually vote on a Continuing Resolution (CR), which is a short-term bill to fund the government. The CR is a temporary measure that keeps the current level of funding so that Congress has time to work out a longer term spending plan. To keep the federal government running in the event of a failure to pass full appropriations bills, Congress must pass the CR, or the government risks being shut down.
￼ 
In the coming days, the Trump administration is expected to revoke California and other states’ authority to adopt vehicle emissions and mileage standards that are more stringent than federal standards. Do you agree or disagree with this decision?   
22%  Agree  75%  Disagree  3%    Don’t Know/Unsure

Manchin's Mountain Message
Celebrating the WV State Fair 
Our home state is special for so many reasons - the natural beauty, resources, growing opportunities, our hardworking and hospitable people, and of course, our annual fairs and festivals. When I was younger, I always looked forward to attending fairs and festivals all over the state because it was not only an opportunity to spend time with my family, but I also learned so much more about our state and its people. We do indeed have much to celebrate in the Mountain State, and the State Fair tradition in beautiful Fairlea is certainly one to be proud of. 
For 94 years, the State Fair of West Virginia has been a greatly anticipated event for residents as well as people from across the nation and around the world. We know our beautiful state is unique in many ways. From our blend of cultures comes delicious food as well as unique traditions, crafts, art and entertainment. This, coupled with the natural welcoming nature of our citizens, makes the State Fair one of the most anticipated events of the year. 
Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to learn more about this wild and wonderful place we call home as the State Fair showcases our traditions of promoting family values, recreation, agriculture and education. This years theme, Start Your Traditions, embraces the 94th year of our talented and inspiring citizens and businesses coming together to showcase the traditions that make West Virginia great. It is through their hard work and creativity that the State Fair has been an outstanding success for 94 years, and one of our proudest traditions. 
Throughout the years, Gayle and I have always enjoyed our many visits to the State Fair. It is a special way for family and friends to come together and create memories that will last for years, and to pass these wonderful traditions on to the next generation. If you have never attended before, or if you have and would like to attend again, I invite you to plan your visit for next year and see for yourself all that the State Fair in our beautiful Mountain State has to offer. 
We look forward to seeing you!

Key Federal Resources
More than $650,000 Announced for WVU Brain Scanner
West Virginia University has been granted $655,649 by the Department of Health and Human Services to support Position Emission Tomography-Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Imagery (PET-EPRI). WVU is currently using a PET-EPRI machine to map intracellular physiology and extracellular parameters of the brains of ambulatory subjects. 
Well-funded research and hardworking innovators lead to important discoveries. I’m proud to know that West Virginia University is home to both. This grant with help the hard working team at West Virginia University advance medicine in unpredictable ways, and as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue to secure similar funding in the future. 
  
Marshall University Receives Diabetes Research Grant
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded Marshall University $440,405 for diabetes, endocrinology, and metabolic research. The funding will help aid research in the identification of diabetes susceptibility genes through integrated functional genomics analysis of gene-diet interaction. 
Innovation stems from experimentation. Therefore medical breakthroughs stem from researchers who are given the resources necessary to experiment. I am thrilled that scientists at Marshall University will receive this federal funding so they can continue testing and innovating, and improving lives. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will work to secure similar funding in the future.

Sixth District Report
￼ 
Dear Friend, 
Last week, I had the privilege of honoring two deserving veterans who embody the best of America's ideals, values, and commitment to serving others by renaming the two Lexington VA medical centers after Private First Class Franklin R. Sousley and Private Troy Bowling.  
I was proud to introduce legislation to officially rename the VA health care facility on Veterans Drive as the Troy Bowling Campus, and the facility on Leestown Road as the Franklin R. Sousley Campus. We can never repay these two Kentucky heroes for their service to our nation, but renaming these VA campuses in their honor will ensure their memory and sacrifices are never forgotten.  
I applaud the Sixth District Veterans Coalition for bringing this idea to my attention and it was an honor to meet family members of the Sousley and Bowling families. To find out more about the legacy of Private First Class Sousley and Private Bowling, click here. 
Camp Nelson Civil War Heritage Park 
￼ 
On August 9, the Department of Interior opened its public comment period for Camp Nelson's possible designation as a national monument. Throughout my time in Congress, I have worked to bring national recognition to this important site in Jessamine County.  
The commenting period will be open for 30 days. To register your opinion on whether Camp Nelson should be included in the National Park System, click here.  
Rebuilding Our Military
￼ 
After years of neglect and cuts in funding to our military, Congress recently passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Conference Report to restore strength and readiness to our military, modernize our military, and provide a much-deserved pay raise for our troops. 
In my capacity as the Chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee, I was honored to serve as a conferee for negotiations on reforms to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). With a surge of malign foreign investment by the Chinese in U.S. assets, Congress is taking the vital step of modernizing both CFIUS and our export controls. These reforms, which I worked on with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, strike the right balance of preserving an open climate for foreign direct investment critical to American competitiveness, while at the same time closing loopholes to thwart any effort by our enemy to steal American critical technology and infrastructure. 
The NDAA Conference Report was signed into law yesterday by the President. To learn more about how the House is providing for our military, go to betteroffnow.gop. 
Economic Growth 
￼ 
Our economy continues to grow as a result of regulatory relief and the enactment of tax reform. The outcome - more Americans can prosper, more businesses can thrive, and our economy can finally flourish. The following are results, not rhetoric: 
	•	4.1% GDP - the fastest rate of growth in nearly 4 years.
	•	American worker pay rate hit the highest level since 2008.
	•	Over the next 7 years, Americans can expect more than 1.44 million new jobs to be created.
	•	U.S. economy added 157,000 jobs in July and the unemployment rate fell to 3.9%.
	•	In Kentucky's Sixth District, the average increase in take-home pay per household over the next 10 years will be $17,386.
	•	Over 640 companies (and counting) have given pay raises, bonuses, or more benefits to their employees.
	•	95.1% of manufactures feel positive about their company's outlook.

Dear Friend, 
On August 14, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law. At the time, growing old typically meant growing poor as well- more than half of all seniors living in the U.S. lived in poverty. Today, thanks to Social Security, our country is stronger. Social Security helps lift over 22 million Americans out of poverty. Without it, the poverty rate of our seniors would be nearly 41%; instead it is just under 9%.
For 83 years, Social Security has helped working Americans retire with dignity and grown the middle class. In 2017, over 61 million Americans received Social Security benefits, including 951,950 Hoosier retirees. As we celebrate Social Security’s success, we must also commit to protecting and preserving the program for decades to come. 
￼ 
If you are having problems with an issue relating to the Social Security Administration (SSA), my office may be able to help. 
Some examples of situations my office may be able to help with are: checking the status of applications for disability and retirement benefits, contacting the SSA payment center to locate and/or aid with distribution of monthly payments, contacting your local SSA office to try to help resolve an over/under payment issues and providing information on the appeals process. 
Recently, my office was contacted by a Hoosier who believed she was eligible for additional SSA assistance. In working on her case, my office learned that she was qualified for SSI (disability) assistance. She will now receive an additional $300.00 a month through the two benefit programs. 
I hope you will join me in supporting Social Security for our seniors in Indiana and across our country. This program transformed America for the better in 1935, let’s make sure this vital program is protected and healthy in the years to come.

8/14/18 15:58,What a week. ,"￼
Last week, I was thrilled to spend time in Utah, where I was able to hear directly from you on how we can improve things in Washington. The Majority Leader’s decision to cancel August recess will allow us to reach our legislative goals and confirm principled judges to the nation’s highest courts. Although the cancellation of August recess shortens the amount of time I am able to be in Utah this month, I was fortunately able to pack five weeks’ worth of state business into one. Here are some of the highlights from my last few days in Utah:
This week, the President is signing my legislation to simplify our national suicide hotline. I sat down with KSL to talk about how my suicide hotline and school safety bills are absolutely critical to Utah.
  ￼

In the months to come, confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court is my top priority. I know the Judge well, which is why I spent ample time making the case for his confirmation in speeches, interviews, and conversations with constituents. 
  ￼  
See a brief video round-up via Facebook!   
This last week, I also had a chance to sit down with the Holts just two months after Josh’s release from captivity in Venezuela. Josh is sharing a powerful message of hope with the world, and I look forward to watching him continue to be a powerful force for good here in Utah.
￼ 
   See video from ABC 4 Utah 
I also spoke at a thought leader symposium hosted by the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce and World Trade Center Utah on the issue of international trade. Free trade has played an instrumental role in our state’s history, which is why I am fighting to create more economic opportunities for Utahns.

After a busy few days, I took the opportunity to fly fish in the Provo River with the Wasatch Guide Service. People come from all over the world come to enjoy Utah’s outdoors. In the short time I spent on the river, I was reminded of just how breathtaking our vistas are and the importance of conserving that beauty for future generations.

Dear Friend, 

Once again, Oregon is suffering through a terrible wildfire season. 

Already, farmers have lost their wheat crops in the Substation Fire; the Klondike Fire burning southwest of Grants Pass has grown to over 55,000 acres, and smoke is not only seriously damaging the outdoor economy but also is creating hazardous air conditions for folks in Southern Oregon. 

That’s why I’m fighting on many fronts to protect Oregonians from wildfires – from investing in prevention on the front end, to making sure that we have the resources to fight mega-fires when they do occur. 

For the wheat farmers in Wasco and Sherman counties whose bumper crops were devastated, I am working to get a waiver from the Department of Agriculture to allow them to plant cover crops without it impacting their crop insurance payments. 

And for all of the farmers affected by the wildfires, find more assistance to file a crop insurance claim here. 

I also pushed to authorize and fund training for the Oregon National Guard to help fight wildfires during the worst of the fire season. I’m also working this month to secure critical wildfire management and prevention funding for the coming fiscal year. 

As the changing climate makes our summers hotter and drier, and bigger and more intense wildfires become more common, we must invest in both recovery and prevention efforts to save our forests, our communities, and our farms, ranches and other businesses from devastating losses. I will continue to do all I can to ensure that Oregon fully recovers, and is more resilient in the future. 

Please, keep all Oregonians affected by wildfires in their thoughts and prayers. 

All my best, 
Jeff

President Signs National Security Authorization Bill
Yesterday, President Trump signed the annual national security authorization bill. Congressman Paul Cook previously voted for the bill, HR 5515, which passed the House overwhelmingly with bipartisan support.

The final bill, which was negotiated through both the House and the Senate, has several provisions which restore military readiness, provide for our troops, and protect our national security against threats both at home and abroad. 

The bill increases the size of the military, fully funds a 2.6% pay raise for our troops, and extends bonuses for service members in high-demand fields. In addition, the bill provides increased training for our troops, rebuilds critical infrastructure, and makes important bureaucratic reforms to ensure that our military is efficient. It also strengthens cyber defense and prioritizes the readiness of US Cyber Command. 

It includes language Congressman Cook specifically proposed including a prohibition on the acquisition of sensitive materials from China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. He also successfully pushed for language that highlights the Army’s need to build a large urban training center for large scale exercises that prepare our soldiers to fight in tomorrow’s dense urban environments.

Big Bear Valley 2018 Chipping Program
The 2018 Chipping Program began on May 1. You may register for the chipping service on Big Bear Fire Department's website.

Vegetation pickup can take up to two weeks after registration.

Dear Friend,
Nearly two months ago, the House acted and passed H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act, by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 396-14.  At the time, NBC News called it, “…the most ambitious congressional push yet to address the growing opioid epidemic, with provisions directing federal agencies to prioritize training, support recovery centers and expand research on several fronts.” 
Combating the opioid crisis has long been a top priority of mine.  As a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, I have worked with my colleagues to advance collaborative, bipartisan legislative solutions while also conducting vigorous investigations into several key issues that have contributed to the crisis. Taken together, this is the most significant congressional effort against a single drug crisis in history. 
It is imperative that the U.S. Senate quickly follow suit, sending H.R. 6 to President Trump’s desk to become law. 
Best personal wishes, 
￼  Leonard Lance

House passes massive package to address opioids crisis 
The House on Friday passed the most ambitious congressional push yet to address the growing opioid epidemic, with provisions directing federal agencies to prioritize training, support recovery centers and expand research on several fronts. 
The package, made up of 58 individual House-approved bills, is the largest legislative effort in recent history to address an epidemic that killed 42,000 people in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
One of the provisions would direct the National Institutes of Health to develop nonaddictive painkillers. Another would try to change how prescription pills are distributed to reduce the potential for abuse. 
… 
Friday's vote follows months of debate on both sides of Capitol Hill, with members holding hearings and voting bills out of committee in a rarely seen bipartisan fashion. 
“This is costing us lives. This is why we’re so focused on ending this opioid epidemic,” Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said at a news conference last week. “This is all hands on deck, and we’re going to keep at this for the sake of families that are hurting right now.”

8/14/18 15:26,fighting for Missouri seniors,"￼
Missouri's seniors have earned their benefits -- but Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are under attack... again.




I've been committed to fighting for Missouri seniors since day one, fighting efforts to privatize Social Security and working to ensure scam artists are held accountable for trying to defraud seniors.  But there's more work to do -- because it seems like every time we turn our heads folks are looking for any way possible to cut, undermine, or weaken the benefits Missouri seniors have earned.
So I'm pushing for new rules to prohibit cuts to Medicare and Medicaid: this legislation would prevent Congress from using partisan tricks to increase the Medicare eligibility age, turn Medicaid into a voucher system, or institute caps limiting benefits.
Millions of Missourians rely on these critical benefits to get basic healthcare -- and cuts to Medicare or Medicaid would leave Missouri's most vulnerable out in the cold. I won't stand for it. 
I also introduced new legislation to fix a glaring problem that's only getting worse: seniors being pushed into poverty due to their Social Security benefits being garnished to pay back old student loan debts. This practice undermines the entire promise of Social Security -- and it's not right. My new bill would ensure that when the federal government recoups defaulted student loan debts, it does not send seniors below the federal poverty line.
￼
I know just how many seniors, mothers, children, and disabled Missourians rely on these critical benefits to survive -- and I know we should be focused on strengthening these programs instead of looking for any opportunity to cut, undermine, or destroy them.  I know I'm not alone in wanting the best for Missouri's seniors, present and future. I won't stand for cuts to critical benefits that support them -- and I won't stop fighting for our seniors.

It’s been a busy week in Indiana. From speaking with farmers at the Indiana State Fair, to joining law enforcement, veterans, and business leaders at events across the state – It’s been great getting to meet so many outstanding Hoosiers. Keep reading for an update from Indiana. 
Growing Jobs and Protecting Hoosier Workers 
Last Tuesday, I spoke with the Rotary Club of Indianapolis about the Senate’s recent accomplishments, including passing tax reform for the first time in 31 years and eliminating more than a dozen job-killing regulations.
 ￼ 
I also spoke with business leaders in Madison and Petersburg, as well as the Columbus Area Chamber of Commerce. We discussed workforce training, tax reform, and the need for a National Economic Security Strategy to protect Hoosier workers.
￼ 
Thank You for Keeping Hoosiers Safe 
I was glad to support law enforcement and first responders at ‘National Night Out 2018’ in Avon last week. We are so thankful for our law enforcement officers and their continued dedication to keeping Hoosiers safe.

￼ 
Indiana State Fair 
I joined Indiana Pork Farmers at their Ham Breakfast to kick off the 2018 Indiana State Fair. It was great to see so many friends! 
￼ 
National Ernie Pyle Day 
We celebrated the legacy of Ernie Pyle on ‘National Ernie Pyle Day’ in Bloomington this month. As a Marine and a Hoosier, I have always appreciated his work, and I was proud to introduce the resolution designating August 3 as National Ernie Pyle Day. Read more from the Tribune Star, here.

￼ 
WORKING GROUP TO STOP DISCHARGES
Lindsey - 
At the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force meeting last month I testified about the need to alter dry season water management strategies to prevent the need for discharges during the wet season. Lowering water levels during the dry season would mitigate the need for discharges immediately and without needing to spend a single additional dollar of taxpayer money. 
The truth is that water is being held on Lake Okeechobee not just as it relates to risk management but as it relates to the benefit of a number of other entities to the detriment of an epicenter of population. This issue absolutely needs to be addressed in the short term because it is an emergency situation of health and welfare. 
At that meeting, Task Force Chairwoman Susan Combs committed to creating a sub-working group to examine dry season water management strategies. THIS FRIDAY, we're holding that working group with federal, state and local officials to advocate for changes in dry season water management to prevent the need for devastating discharges that have been destroying the Treasure Coast. 
Our working group on Friday is open to everybody, so please come and share with your neighbors who are as concerned about our community's destruction as we are. Here's the info you need: 
Friday, August 17th 11:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.

This is Robby.  He’s a German Shepherd, and a Military Working Dog.  Together with his partner and handler, U.S. Navy Petty Officer Ashlea Scully, they bravely served our country in Iraq where Robby lost an eye and the full use of his legs.
￼ 
And similar sacrifices were made by Senior Airman Leach and his Military Working Dog (MWD) Rudy. And by Staff Sargent Shenton and MWD KKrusty, and Staff Sargent Gray and MWD (Ret.) OJ. 
￼  
 Throughout our history, we’ve trained, equipped and utilized our military K9 units to help safeguard Americans at home and abroad. They sniffed out poison gas in WWI, found bombs and saved lives in WWII and Vietnam, and even served with SEAL Team 6 as they raided Osama Bin Laden's hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan.    And yet, we have failed to formally recognize the courageous service of thousands of military working dogs and their handlers...until now! I’m proud to announce that moments ago, my bill to create the Guardians of America’s Freedom Medal is finally became law.  
￼ 
WATCH THIS VIDEO ON OUR TWO-YEAR EFFORT TO GET THIS DONE. 
 The brave acts of military working dogs and their handlers deserves recognition because whether these soldiers stand on four legs or two, they have consistently put America’s safety first.  It is time we honor them.     Post your thanks to military working dogs and their handlers by sharing this story about our new award on Facebook here, or you can share it on Twitter here.

New Yorkers Demand Better USPS Service!

Dear Friend: 

Join me on Wednesday, August 15th at 10:00 a.m. at the Inwood Post Office located at 90 Vermilyea Avenue to demand better customer service and efficiency from the United States Postal Service (USPS). During the press conference, I will unveil my in-depth report of the USPS facilities operating within New York’s 13th congressional district. 

I received several complaints from constituents and residents following their engagement and daily interaction with the USPS and decided to see for myself the impact these persistent issues have on our community. From misplaced and lost mail, delayed deliveries, long wait times at local facilities, and poor customer service - my 2018 post office report outlines several recommendations based on a survey conducted of the postal facilities located in the neighborhoods of Harlem, East Harlem and northern Manhattan and aims to help improve our nation's mail delivery process. 

The following is a snapshot of recommendations from the report.

1. USPS employees should regularly host townhall meetings to allow for public exchange and engagement; 

2. USPS should maintain records of anticipated wait times at each postal facility and ensure adequate personnel;

3. USPS should maintain records of erroneous delivered or lost mail; 

4. Implement customer service training for all USPS employees; 

5. USPS branch staff should reflect the community it serves, including bilingual or multi-lingual employees in diverse communities. 

￼

Dear Friend,  
In an era of rapid technological change, we should make sure to keep a close eye on the impact that new technologies have on our society, especially on children. That’s why I recently introduced bipartisan legislation – the Children and Media Research Advancement (CAMRA) Act – that authorizes the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to lead a research program on technology and media’s effects on infants, children, and adolescents in core areas of cognitive, physical, and socio-emotional development. 
My legislation is cosponsored by Republican Ted Budd of North Carolina. In the Senate, it was filed by Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts along with a number of Senators from both parties.  
Just think about how much our daily lives have changed in the last decade and how frequently all of us are on new devices and using new forms of communication. I believe new technology has brought a lot of good, but we also need to study if there are downsides as well – so that we can have a better understanding of how to respond. As a parent who is watching his daughters grow up in this new social media era, I am especially concerned about how new media might impact the emotional and mental health of young people. 
To read more about the CAMRA Act, click here. 
The new research in our legislation would investigate the impact of exposure to and use of media such as mobile devices, computers, social media, applications, websites, television, motion pictures, artificial intelligence, video games, and virtual and augmented reality. 
Supporters of the bill include: the Internet Association, the American Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, the Center for Digital Democracy and Common Sense Media. 
With our phones and tablets such an integral part of our lives, we need definitive answers sooner than later, and I thank Senator Markey, Rep. Budd and the rest of our bipartisan partners for teaming up on this important measure. 
Sincerely, 
John

Congresswoman Beatty Celebrates Social Security’s 83rd Anniversary 
On August 14, 1935, the Social Security Act was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In honor of Social Security’s 83rd anniversary and as a vice-chair of the House Democratic Caucus’ Seniors Taskforce, U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) issued the following statement: 
“For more than eight decades, Social Security has provided hundreds of millions of older Americans and individuals with disabilities the financial stability and support they so desperately need. In fact, today, nearly 50 percent of Social Security beneficiaries rely on the program for a majority of their income. That is why it is more important than ever for Congress to strengthen and improve Social Security—not cut it. As Vice-Chair of the House Democratic Caucus’ Seniors Taskforce, I promise to continue to protect Social Security for today’s seniors and future generations.”       
￼ 
Congresswoman Beatty is recognized by the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.

Dear Friend, 
Hope you're having a great week so far! I wanted to give you a quick update on my weekend activities across South and West Texas. Here are the highlights:  
Palo Alto College's ""She Code Connect"" summer camp led by Youth Code Jam allows girls to gain hands-on experience in all things computer science, and learn more about the wide range of technology careers. I'm so glad I got to see this camp in action and visit with these bright young women in STEM.  
￼ 
And let's play ball! I'm thrilled to see so many talented baseball teams across our nation come down to TX-23 for the 2018 Babe Ruth 14-year-olds World Series at Moncada Field in Eagle Pass. Best of luck my friends! 
￼ 
Wonderful visiting with our first responders of Air Evac Lifeteam 57 in Eagle Pass at Fort Duncan Regional Medical Center over the weekend. My thanks to our brave TX-23 Air Evac Lifeteams in Carrizo Springs, Del Rio, Pearsall and here in Eagle Pass! 
￼ 
A wise man once said that ""we make a living by what we get, we make a life by what we give."" San Antonio's Community for Life Foundation was set up to do just that: empower students to be able to give back throughout their lifetimes. Congrats to this year's scholarship recipients! 
￼ 
Did you know this week is National Health Center Week? The community health centers I represent provide quality, affordable care and services that are vital for the health and wellness of hundreds of thousands of South and West Texans. I'm proud of the work that they do and will continue to value our CHCs.  
￼ 
As always, please don't hesitate to reach out to my office with any questions or concerns. 
For further updates on my work for you, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube at @HurdontheHill, and be sure to forward this email to your family and friends!
 
Have a great rest of your week!

Good morning - 
I take seriously the responsibility Iowans have entrusted in me to make our government more competent and less wasteful. 
With the national debt currently exceeding $21 trillion, my Squeal Award identifies specific areas of government abuse, pork barrel spending and inefficiencies that have proven to be unnecessary and must be cut.  

Squeal Award: $15 Billion Authorized by Congress, yet Unspent by the Executive Branch 
Building on my efforts to make Washington squeal, I helped introduce the President’s rescission package in the Senate, legislation that rescinds $15 billion in unspent funds.  This legislation not only allows the government to take back unused funds, but also prevents Congress from redirecting these dollars to spend more money elsewhere. 
At $15 billion, this is the largest rescission package ever proposed, and the first since the year 2000.  
It includes several common-sense spending cuts. For example, it would rescind over $4 billion in unused funds from a program that provides loans to car manufacturers for the production of advanced vehicles.  There have not been any new loans issued under this program since 2011, and the Government Accountability Office has recommended rescinding funding unless the Department of Energy can show there is demand and viable applications for these loans.
It would also cut $86 million in unused funding for earmarks and over $100 million in unused Department of Transportation funding that was appropriated in the early 2000s. 
At a time when we are $21 trillion in debt, this bill would have been a small step in the right direction, cutting unobligated funds that are not necessary to administer programs and services. 
Unfortunately, some of my colleagues were unwilling to cut even unspent and unnecessary dollars. The measure failed in the Senate by a vote of 48 to 50. 
For failing to pass this common-sense rescission package, I hereby present the United States Senate with this month’s Squeal Award.

Come and Read It Report
Dear Texans, 
August is my favorite month of the year because it means I get to travel up and down Texas' 25th District and talk with constituents of all kinds. I love meeting with hardworking Americans like y'all and hearing your concerns and ideas that I can take back with me to Washington in September. As I continue to crisscross Central Texas these next few weeks, I'd like to take this time to share with you what I've been up to:
￼ 
I enjoyed meeting with the Owen Oil Tools' leadership and employees to learn what issues matter to them, such as continuing to cut taxes so they can reinvest into their operations, and their concerns over steel tariffs. I am proud to represent these folks in Congress, and I will continue to fight to ensure their prosperity. For more information, click here. 
￼ 
As the representative for a veteran-proud community, I am glad I had the opportunity to meet with the leaders of Central Texas Veterans Health Care System. The work these folks do here is so important – just last year they had over 1.2 million outpatient visits. I will never stop fighting for our veterans. These heroes sacrificed a great deal in order to protect this nation and I will continue to support them in any way that I can. We must continue to hold the VA accountable and never stop working to make it better. For more, click here. 
￼ 
Dell Children’s plays a critical role in our Central Texas community. In addition to serving 46 counties, Dell Children’s knows how important it is to treat each individual child with the utmost care. I appreciated the tour of their facility, as well as hearing firsthand from the doctors and nurses about what we can do in Congress to better meet the needs of patients. For the full story, click here. 
￼ 
I enjoyed talking with members of the Wimberley Chamber of Commerce and hearing their ideas and concerns. As their representative, I will continue to work hard with my colleagues until tax cuts are made permanent for every American. Click here for more info. 
￼ 
It was great to meet with community leaders a part of the West Austin Rotary. These folks shared their experiences with me regarding the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that was passed last December, as well as improvements we all hope to see in Tax Reform 2.0. It is of the utmost importance that we make tax cuts permanent for all Americans, and I will continue to fight on behalf of Texas’ 25th District until we achieve just that. Click here for more on this. 
￼ 
I have fought every day to bring a commonsense business owner’s perspective to Washington. After years of fighting for the American worker, I am proud to say that we accomplished just that last year when we passed the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. However, my work on behalf of the constituents of Texas’ 25th District is far from done. It was great to hear ideas from members of the Lake Travis Breakfast Club - I will keep fighting for taxes that are fairer, flatter, simpler and permanent. For more, click here. 
￼ 
As a resident of Austin, Texas, it’s always good to be back with the members of the local Chamber of Commerce and hear their priorities for the rest of the legislative year. I appreciated their ideas and look forward to working with House Leadership to address them in upcoming legislation. For more info, click here. 
￼ 
For over 80 years, Pedernales Electric Cooperative has been supplying important utilities to America. Being the largest electric distribution cooperative in the nation, PEC provides thousands of jobs for hardworking Americans, and I am proud to represent them in the 25th District of Texas. It was great to tour their new facility and hear the concerns of their workforce. As a small business owner, I am proud to be their voice in Washington and will continue fight for their priorities. Click here for more. 
￼ 
I had the great opportunity to visit the folks at Coryell Memorial Healthcare System to get debriefed on the explosion that happened back in June. I appreciate their willingness to talk with me about it and their plans for the future. Everyone in Texas' 25th is behind them, and we are thankful for such a strong community. 
Washington Update 
Last week, I joined KCEN TV Channel 6 and Fox 7 Austin's Good Day Austin to discuss what I've been working on in Washington this year. We talked about the state of the economy, House Republican's plan for Tax Reform 2.0, my school security bill, H.R. 5107, and what we can do to better secure our borders. 
I also joined Fox Business' Mornings with Maria to discuss immigration at the Southern Border and what Congress is doing to fix our flawed system. Click here or below to watch. 
￼ 
I have included some articles and releases you may find interesting located on the right side of this newsletter. It is an honor and privilege to represent the people of Texas’ 25th Congressional District and as always, please reach out to me with any issues and concerns that are important to you.
In God we trust,

DISTRICT
 
Dear Friends, 
During this District Work Period I have enjoyed being back in Texas and meeting with constituents about how federal efforts can better help our local communities. By focusing our efforts on local communities, and not on empowering Washington, we have empowered Texas to become the best state in the country to do business.  
Our thriving local community is also the reason that the U.S. Army selected Austin, Texas as the location for their new Army Futures Command. I sat down with Elizabeth Jeneault of Spectrum's In Focus to discuss how the new Army Futures Command headquarters will help the United States Army be better prepared for an ever-changing enemy and threats, including cyberattacks.

Library of Congress' Veterans History Project 
Earlier today, I announced the start of this year’s Veterans History Project, a nation-wide preservation effort with the Library of Congress. I want to invite all veterans residing in the 10th Congressional District of Texas who have served in any capacity from World War II to recent conflicts to share their stories so their legacy can be preserved in the Library of Congress. As the proud son of a WWII B-17 bombardier, I am inspired and awestruck by the service of our men and women in uniform. I want to make sure their stories, these important historical accounts, will be preserved for generations to come.
You can click here to learn more about the project and how you can get involved.

 We are Better Off Now 
When Ronald Reagan took to the stage in his only debate against Jimmy Carter in 1980, he asked the American people one simple question: “are you better off than you were four years ago?”  The answer was a resounding “no!” 
Just over two years ago, the American people were again asked this question, and again could not respond positively.  My colleagues and I heard from our constituents that they had become disillusioned by our country’s direction.  The idea of providing their kids with a better life was quickly slipping away and the American Dream was disappearing.
With that in mind, Republicans in Congress drafted our “Better Way Agenda.”  It laid out a thoughtful Republican policy agenda intended to put America back on the right track. Our “Better Way” focused on revitalizing our economy, bolstering our national security, safeguarding our communities, and recapturing the American Dream. 
And now – two years later – America is better off.

Visiting Utex Industries  
Utex Industries, Inc. is the largest employer in Weimar. Since the late 1940s, Utex has grown from being a distributor of cut gaskets and packing to being a manufacturer of a complete and diverse range of fluid sealing products, ranging from a simple gasket to a highly engineered gas-buffered mechanical face seal. Even though it's headquartered here in TX-10, it serves numerous industries in over 50 countries worldwide. I had the privilege of touring the facility, meeting with their employees, and learning more about how they help grow our local economy.
￼ 
Weimer Roundtable 
While in Weimer, I also held a roundtable meeting with business and community leaders to discuss our tax reform legislation and other issues that are facing the county.  
￼ 
  
Barker Reservoir Watershed Community Meeting 
The Harris County Flood Control District (HCFCD) is holding a series of 23 community engagement meetings, one in each HCFCD watershed, to discuss potential projects and receive community input on the emergency bond election under discussion for August 25, 2018. I was glad to join one of the meetings that took place for the Barker Reservoir Watershed community and talk to constituents about my efforts to push for an infrastructure solution in the area. 
￼ 
Meeting with Austin County Representatives 
It was great to meet with Industry Mayor Mable Meyers and Austin County Commissioner Bobby Rinn about the important work we have to do in our local communities to rebuild after Hurricane Harvey as well as combating human trafficking and the opioid epidemic.

#TaxCutsandJobsAct Update 
As always, you can stay up to date via my twitter feed on the latest information surrounding our historic tax reform and the economic optimism it has produced. Below is a tweet about the Tax Foundation's latest report that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is projected to produce over 1.4 million full-time jobs by 2025. 
You can click here or on the tweet below to learn more.

Legislative Update 
Today, President Trump signed the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) into law. This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild our nation’s military by delivering the largest increase in defense funding in 15 years coupled with the largest pay raise for our service members in eight years. We are ensuring that at a moment’s notice, our brave men and women have the tools they need to defend our nation.
Last week, Members were in their districts for a District Work Period. There were no votes held in the House last week. 
This week, Members will continue to be in their districts for a District Work Period. As such, there are no votes expected in the House.
As always, I encourage you to visit my website, www.mccaul.house.gov, for more information on constituent services and legislative updates. Also, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube to get the latest updates on my work in Washington and the 10th District of Texas. It continues to be a great honor to represent you in the United States House of Representatives.

8/13/18 21:27,Highlighting AL-02’s Summer Interns,"News from Martha Roby
Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window          Click here to open a plain text version of this email
￼ 
Friends, 
It’s hard to believe that summer is winding down and most students are already back in school. As the mother of two school-aged children, I know firsthand how precious the summer months are and how quickly they always seem to fly by. The Roby family is geared up and ready to take on another school year, and if you have children in school, I wish your family a happy and healthy school year, too.
As a member of Congress, each summer I have the privilege of offering internship opportunities to college students from our district. Students have the choice to intern in my Washington, Montgomery, Dothan, or Andalusia office. Typically, we offer four-week internship opportunities during the months of May, June, July, and August, but we do our very best to accommodate students’ and universities’ varying schedules. 
This internship program is a competitive experience designed for those students who are interested in learning more about our nation’s legislative process, constituent services and the general day-to-day operations of a congressional office. Interns’ tasks vary, but they include conducting tours of the United States Capitol building, drafting and presenting a policy proposal on a legislative topic of their choosing, assisting constituents with their various needs and requests, attending committee hearings, and more.
This summer, I was fortunate to have quite a few outstanding students serve as interns in my offices. These students worked very hard for our district, and I really appreciate their dedication and eagerness to serve their communities. I’m confident they will be successful in whatever paths they pursue. You can read more about these AL-02 students in my weekly column. 
You can also find out more about my internship program and the application process on my website. If you know a college-aged student who might be interested in being part of the legislative process for the summer, I hope you will pass this information along to them. I truly believe a congressional internship is a valuable way to gain firsthand exposure to the inner workings of our nation’s government.
HYUNDAI FILLS BACKPACKS FOR MONTGOMERY STUDENTS 
￼ 
As students across Alabama headed back to school, Hyundai pitched in and helped to fill 500 backpacks with school supplies for Montgomery students. I really appreciate their involvement in our local community!
AUNT KATIE'S COMMUNITY GARDEN GROWS WITH EPA GRANTS 
In 2017, the City of Dothan was one of five cities in Alabama to receive an EPA Brownfields grant. Dothan received $300,000 to help turn potentially environmentally unsound properties into attractive lots that could help spur economic development in several areas. One of the recipients of this money is Aunt Katie’s Community Garden. I am grateful for the hard work and diligence of Dothan’s local leaders – they were instrumental in securing this funding.
Read about Aunt Katie’s Community Garden’s plans for this growing season here.  
PURPLE HEART DAY 
￼ 
Last week, we recognized Purple Heart Day. On this day and every day, we should honor those who were wounded or killed while protecting our nation. We owe these heroes a great debt of gratitude for the sacrifices made to defend our country and freedoms.
UPDATES ON ELMORE COUNTY 
￼ 
Last week I met with Elmore County Commission Chairman Troy Stubbs. He gave me an update on the many great projects happening in the community, and I appreciate his time and dedication. 
THE WEEK AHEAD 
I am looking forward to traveling throughout AL-02 this week to visit with constituents and local leaders to discuss a number of issues including rural broadband and career tech education. Don't forget to follow along with me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.       
It is an honor to serve you in Congress. Please never hesitate to let me know if there is a way my office can be of assistance.   Sincerely,  
￼  Martha Roby

8.13.18 Our Bill to Support Military Families and Increase Security Becomes Law
Dear Friend, 
Big news: Today, President Trump signed the annual defense bill which included provisions that I advocated on behalf of to give our troops a much-deserved raise, make smart investments in Virginia’s shipbuilding industry, expand access to cyber education in Virginia, authorize military construction projects throughout the Commonwealth, and more.
He also signed into law key pieces of my bills to reduce military spouse unemployment. After hearing from Virginia military spouses about huge employment obstacles and financial insecurity they face because of frequent moves, I introduced bills that will help military spouses get jobs and improve access to child care and counseling resources for military families. I’m thrilled this will help us start to offer relief to military families who sacrifice so much for our nation. 
This is a great bipartisan win for Virginia and the entire country.
Read more about the bill here >>
Every year, I work on this bill with my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee to advance our security and provide our troops with the resources they need to keep our country safe. This year was no different, and I am proud of the bill we put on the President’s desk. Please know I’ll always support our servicemembers and their families.  

Sincerely,
￼
Senator Tim Kaine

Kansas Common Sense  August 13, 2018
Hello,
 
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.
 
With the elimination of the August recess, Senators had a week-long state work period before the Senate reconvened for the remainder of the month. The elimination of the recess and the additional days in session mean the Senate will be able to pass necessary appropriations bills in regular order and allow more time for the consideration of the president’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, as well as other judges and nominees awaiting consideration. I am pleased the Senate will work in Washington to accomplish these important tasks on behalf of the American people.
 
Hosting Kansas Listening Tour Stops Across the State
This week, I hosted several Kansas Listening Tour stops to hear from Kansans about the issues that matter to them. While we covered a wide array of issues, trade was a large and important part of almost every discussion.
 
Neosho County
Thanks to Neosho County residents for sharing their thoughts with me during my Kansas Listening Tour stop in Chanute on Tuesday. We discussed a number of issues, including career and technical education and the recently reauthorized Perkins Act, healthcare and rural hospitals, veterans and the VA MISSION Act, as well as NATO, expanding rural broadband, the Farm Bill, and our agricultural and steel economies and how tariffs are impacting local businesses and farmers. Thanks to Neosho County Community College President Dr. Brian Inbody for hosting me and to Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Jane Brophy for arranging my visit.
￼ 
Montgomery County On Tuesday, I also visited with Coffeyville residents about many of the same items, in addition to Medicare and Social Security, USDA’s rural development initiatives and its work to help small communities flourish, the impact of newsprint tariffs and issues facing senior citizens. Thanks to Coffeyville Community College President Linda Moley and Yvonne Hull for hosting me, and to State Representative Jim Kelly for attending.
￼ 
Saline County Thanks to Saline County residents for sharing their thoughts with me during my townhall meeting in Salina. The discussion placed a special focus on trade, and we heard information on the economics of trade from Americans for Prosperity. I also fielded questions from the audience on a variety of other issues, including Iran sanctions, my ongoing investigation into the abuse of amateur and Olympic athletes, infrastructure and the Farm Bill. Thank you to Elizabeth Patton, Jeff Glendening, State Representative Steven Johnson, Salina Chamber of Commerce CEO Don Weiser and Salina Regional Airport Director Tim Rogers for attending. Read more from the Salina Journal on the meeting and my work on recent trade actions that have affected Kansas farmers, ranchers and manufacturers. 
￼ 
Ness County I appreciated hearing from Ness County residents in Ness City on a variety of issues, including the farm bill, crop insurance, trade and the devastating effects of tariffs, immigration and the need for agricultural workers, our current healthcare laws, essential air service, the VA Choice Program and the VA MISSION Act. Thank you to Charlie Schippers and High Plains Farm Credit for hosting my townhall. Thanks also to County Commissioners Dave Albers and Sandy Rupp, Economic Development Director Cinda Flax and American Legion leader Gary Foos for attending.
￼ 
Hodgeman County Thanks to Hodgeman County residents for attending my Kansas Listening Tour stop at Bootleggers in Jetmore, a newly-opened restaurant owned by Jetmore native Kyler Fetters. We discussed trade, including the importance of negotiating agreements like NAFTA and TPP. We also talked about commodity prices, tariffs, the VA Choice Program and the VA MISSION Act, Amtrak and funding for local law enforcement. Thank you to Michael Ort and the Lions Club for hosting my townhall. Thanks also to Mayor Derek Olson, County Commissioners Marsha Ewy and Darrell Craighead, Sheriff Jared Walker and County Clerk Sarah Rains for attending.
￼ 
Meade County I visited with a number of Meade residents, including the new Meade District Hospital CEO Tara Ramlochan, Meade County Clerk Janet Hale, Meade County Treasurer Michelle Benear and USD 226 Superintendent Kenneth Harshberger, in addition to many other individuals. We discussed various issues such as caring for our veterans, healthcare, education, the Farm Bill and my work urging the administration to keep Kansans in mind during trade negotiations and decisions on tariffs. Thanks to many folks for taking time to visit with me in Meade.
￼ 
Wichita County On Friday in Wichita County, I heard from Leoti residents on many issues involving agriculture, trade and important provisions in the Farm Bill. Thanks to Wichita County Clerk Lynda Goodrich, Wichita County Treasurer Diana Long, Register of Deeds Connie Wilson, courthouse officials, the Farm Service Agency office and USD 467 for your time.
￼ 
I also stopped by Heartland Mill in Marienthal. I enjoyed visiting with CEO Mark Nightengale and his son, Chef Ashlyn Nightengale, where they explained their mill and the unique practices they employ when growing wheat. The Nightengales, like many Kansas farmers and ranchers, have a deep appreciation for the land that inspires myself and many.
￼ 
Greeley County I enjoyed visiting with Greeley County residents in Tribune Friday afternoon about the importance of rural America and my ongoing work to be a voice for these communities. We also discussed veterans’ issues, rural healthcare challenges, the Farm Bill, trade and NAFTA, tariffs and opportunity zones. Thanks to Todd Schmidt for helping arrange my visit and to the unified government Board of Supervisors Chairman Kirby Kleymann for attending.

Meeting with Garden City and Dodge City Officials on Amtrak and the Southwest Chief On Friday, I met with officials from Garden City and Dodge City at the Amtrak Depot in Garden City to discuss the importance of maintaining Amtrak’s Southwest Chief rail service in Kansas. We discussed the economic importance of rail service to the region and its impact on individuals in the local community, and I shared details and offered an update on my amendment that passed the Senate last week. This amendment would make certain Amtrak maintains train service along the route and would also provide resources for maintenance and grant dollars for municipalities. 
I am committed to working to maintain the Southwest Chief and rail service in Kansas, and I will continue working with local officials and my colleagues in the Senate to make certain Kansas communities have access to the rail services that Amtrak has promised them. As the divide between urban and rural communities in America continues to expand, passenger rail services like the Southwest Chief are invaluable in connecting Kansans to the rest of the country while also bringing visitors from out of state to our local communities. 
Thanks to City Manager Matt Allen, Assistant City Manager Steve Cottrell, Mayor Roy Cessna and other city leaders for hosting me. Thank you to Dodge City Assistant City Manager Ernestor De La Rosa and State Representative Brad Ralph for traveling to Garden City to attend. You can read more on the meeting from the Garden City Telegram.

Dear Friends: 
As summer draws to a close and teachers get ready for the new school year, I had the privilege of attending several teacher appreciation events throughout the district - Operation Bless Wildwood Annual Teachers Appreciation Breakfast, Tavares Chamber Teacher Appreciation Luncheon, and Leesburg Annual Teachers Appreciation Breakfast. Teachers and staff were treated to food, fun, and a few gifts as they prepare to welcome students back to their classrooms. 
Thank you to all our teachers and school administrators for your dedicated work. You are making a difference in the lives of your students and are shaping their future.

Serving veterans is one of my priorities. Working with liaisons and County Veteran Service offices, my office has secured more than $2 million for veterans in my district in compensation, pensions or retroactive payments. There is more work to be done. Visiting with and hearing from veterans is key as we seek to reform the VA and ensure they receive the care and services they have earned. On Wednesday, I visited with residents, veterans, and staff at Sumter Senior Living and Élan Buena Vista. Thank you to the veterans who shared their stories of bravery and sacrifice.  
￼ 
_______________ 
I was also honored to present a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol to the Vietnam Veterans Chapter 1036 Club Volunteer Coordinator, Mr. Eldred J. “Sonny” Baker for his dedication to serving veterans in the club and in the community. We owe a debt of gratitude to our veterans for their service and sacrifices.
￼ ￼ 
_______________
I had the opportunity to tour the Orlando Health South Lake Hospital Emergency Room at Blue Cedar. Thank you to the health care staff who provide support to patients who are at their most vulnerable. 
￼ 
_______________ 
Small businesses are the backbone of our country’s economy and vital job creators in my district.  I fought to make sure the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ended the practice of tedious depreciation schedules that are burdensome to small businesses. It was great to spend time at Charlotte Pipe and Foundry in Wildwood and speak with the owners and employees. Charlotte Pipe is the largest manufacturer of Drain, Waste, and Vent (DWV) pipe and fittings in the U.S. 
￼ 
_______________ 
It was an honor to present a flag flown over the Capitol to the Alzheimer’s Family Organization. The Alzheimer’s Family Organization focuses on helping caregivers achieve and maintain a better quality of life not only for their loved ones, but for themselves. 
￼ 
_______________ 
Transportation – moving people and goods – is key to Florida’s economy.  Investing in and improving Florida’s infrastructure is one of my focuses as I serve on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Located 35 miles northwest of Orlando, the Leesburg International Airport is a central hub for transportation and business in Central Florida. I enjoyed meeting with Firehawk Helicopters and Skybolt Aerospace Fasteners and learning about the full range of services provided by the airport.

Constituent Corner
After helping a constituent from Ocklawaha correct his military records to file for an award, my office began trying to find out why there was a delay in processing the claim. We worked with the regional VA office and learned that while it was not yet completed, it was being processed. While it took another three months, the award was granted, also creating a small retroactive benefit.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.  
District Update
Last weekend, my Community Relations Representative, Victoria, attended an event at Citrus Elks Lodge 2693 commemorating the 236th anniversary of the Purple Heart. Created by General George Washington on August 7, 1782 to recognize a soldier’s meritorious action, the Purple Heart is our nation’s oldest decoration. We owe our veterans a debt that we can never repay. It is due to countless lives selflessly lived and lost in defense of our country that we can stand today, free and grateful.

My Service Academy Coordinator, Laura, and District Director, Christa, joined the Deans and Directors of Admission from all five of the United States Service Academies at an admissions workshop in Tampa and answered questions from constituents about the application process for receiving a congressional nomination.

Legislative Update
Great news. Today, President Trump signed the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019 into law.  In doing this the President is keeping another campaign promise to rebuild and restore our military readiness. This is the earliest the bill has been passed and signed into law in more than two decades. The bill helps the Department of Defense develop a more lethal and resilient force, and grows the size of our forces by authorizing an increase of 15,600 troops across the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. It also authorizes end strengths of 487,500 in the Army; 335,400 in the Navy; 186,100 in the Marine Corps; and 329,100 in the Air Force. Additionally, the bill authorizes a 2.6 percent military pay raise for our service members – the largest in 9 years.
The NDAA will increase training and improve readiness, authorizing 20 Combat Training Center Rotations for the Army as well as improvements to the readiness of naval surface ships. Furthering President Trump’s goal of developing our warfighting capabilities in space, the NDAA authorizes the United States Space Command to be established under the United States Strategic Command. The bill also requires a comprehensive review of both wounded warrior care and mental health services to ensure service members receive the best possible treatment. It makes substantial improvements to the transition assistance program designed to provide training tailored to Servicemembers’ post-separation plans. Click here for more information on this comprehensive bill.

Peach State Priorities
Dear Friends,
Earlier today, President Donald Trump signed into law one of the most important bills that Congress has passed this year: the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, commonly known as the NDAA. Every year, this comprehensive bill fulfills our Constitutional duties to ensure the safety and security of the American people. The FY’19 NDAA addresses our military priorities for this upcoming year – from ensuring cyber and electronic warfare readiness to deterring the nuclear capabilities of our adversaries. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I was proud to have a seat at the table in drafting this legislation and in fighting to include provisions important to the State of Georgia. 
With nine military installations and more than 100,000 military employees statewide, the Peach State plays a critical role in our national security. Significantly, the NDAA provides $99 million for a Cyber Instructional Facility at Fort Gordon in Augusta, $13.6 million for a Navy Reserve Training Center at Fort Benning in Columbus, and $31.9 million for a Welding and Body Repair Shop Facility at the Marine Corps Logistics Base in Albany. The NDAA also provides a 2.6% pay raise for our brave men and women in uniform – the largest in nine years – and approves requests from the Army, Navy, and Air Force for additional personnel. 
I was proud to author two amendments to the NDAA that will directly benefit Georgia’s institutions, including Fort Gordon’s Cyber Center of Excellence. The first authorizes the Secretary of Defense to establish a Cyber Institute at each of the senior military colleges, including the University of North Georgia in Dahlonega. The second directs the Department of Defense to present a strategic plan to leverage and expand current partnerships with industry and academia on cyber education. I’m proud that both of these provisions were adopted in committee and will work to strengthen the next generation of cyber warfighters. 
This morning, I caught up with State Representative Dave Belton, Chairman of the Military Affairs Committee in the Georgia House of Representatives, to discuss the ways in which our state is contributing to the protection of our Nation. Through collaborative efforts on both a federal and a state level, we are on the frontlines of meeting our national security needs. Thank you, Dave, for joining me in my Monroe District Office this morning to talk about these important issues. Click here to watch our Facebook Live video.

District Connection
It’s heartening to witness the immense growth and opportunity flourishing in the area after visiting several 10th District employers and medical centers. I started off this morning at Hitachi Automotive Systems Americas, Inc. in Monroe. Since 1996, Hitachi has significantly expanded its work manufacturing and marketing engine management and car information systems worldwide, and it is now Walton County’s number one employer! I was extremely impressed by the innovations they’ve been making to modernize their business for the 21st century. Thanks for letting me come by!
￼
Congressman Hice discusses economic growth and employment opportunities with CEO and President of Hitachi Automotive, Paul Carroll
Immediately afterwards, I headed over to Elite Storage Systems, also in Monroe. This company has manufactured, designed, and engineered pallet racks and storage solutions for multiple industries here for years. Founded by the President and CEO Steve South’s grandfather, Elite Storage Systems has grown exponentially, transforming from a mom and pop manufacturing company to a successful international business with a large employment base in Walton County, providing big-name corporations with much of their materials. It was great seeing the important work y’all do in our community! 
￼
Representative Hice speaks with CEO and President of Elite Storage Systems, Steve South
During a working lunch with local leaders at Hot Rod’s Diner in Social Circle, I’m glad I got the opportunity to hear from folks in the community. This eatery opened its doors in 2013 and has been serving old fashioned hamburgers and hot dogs ever since! I was happy to be able to speak about the low unemployment numbers and what local officials, educators, and industry leaders can do to help bolster our workforce. Thanks for keeping me updated on your priorities. 
￼
Congressman Hice joins local leaders to talk about community development
As many of you know, thanks to tireless efforts of the Joint Development Authority of Jasper, Morgan, Newton, and Walton Counties, our district earned a historic opportunity to become home to Facebook’s new Data Center. This massive development translates into real jobs and economic growth right here in our own backyard. Today, I was thrilled to be able to see the progress being made at this center within our district. Thanks for having me!
￼
Representative Hice reviews building and floor plans for the upcoming Facebook Data Center
Continuing my busy day, later in the afternoon, I visited the Pregnancy Resource Center (PRC) of Walton, which provides help and education for pregnant women in a Christian atmosphere. Under the direction of Executive Director Carol Fairman, PRC Walton has purchased new equipment and is instituting new programs to better help local mothers. It was heartwarming to see the support given by the men and women working here, and I’m proud to see Christ working through each and every one of you. 
￼
Congressman Hice and his wife, Dee Dee, meet with staff and volunteers from the Women's Health and Wellness Clinic of Walton
Lastly, I made my way to Faith in Serving Humanity (FISH) of Walton. These folks work collaboratively as a Christian outreach ministry sponsored by several churches throughout Walton County to provide medical and dental care free of charge to those in need. This organization also provides spiritual guidance, financial support, and food for the needy in our area. Staffed mostly by volunteer workers and supported primarily by charitable contributions from individuals and churches, this non-profit has been making a difference in the 10th District for more than 20 years. It was an honor to be able to see the incredible works that they have been doing firsthand!
￼
Representative and Dee Dee Hice learn about the charitable works being done by FISH Medical and Dental from Pastor Hugo Brian-Porter and Executive Director Cindy Little

Upcoming Events
Next weekend, I will be holding my annual Service Academy Day at Georgia Military College in Milledgeville! This event is a great opportunity for those interested in attending one of our Nation’s Military Service Academies to familiarize themselves with the application and nomination processes. From 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. on Saturday, August 18, you can hear about best practices and speak with members of my staff and representatives from all five military branches about the world-class education provided by these academies. Admission is free and open to students, parents, and teachers. To learn more about this event, visit my website or email my Academy Director at Carolyn.dallas@mail.house.gov. 
￼

At the end of this month, the Wrightsville Rotary Club, in conjunction with Probate Judge Mary Jo Buxton, will be holding an honors ceremony for local Vietnam veterans. This ceremony, on Tuesday, August 28th, at 6:00 p.m., will celebrate Vietnam veterans in our community for their service to our Nation. All Georgia veterans with honorable service in the Vietnam War between June 1, 1954 and May 15, 1975 are eligible. Our Vietnam veterans have made tremendous sacrifices, and I am proud to join with local leaders to recognize and celebrate these heroes. The deadline to register is Tuesday, August 21st, so if you or someone you know is interested in participating, please contact the Georgia Department of Veteran Services at bzeringue@vs.state.ga.us. You may also find more information on my website.

Internship Opportunities
My offices – both in Washington, D.C. and in Georgia – are always on the lookout for dedicated and hardworking students to serve as interns. In this position, individuals will gain firsthand experience working in a Congressional office and assisting my staff in serving 10th District constituents. My D.C., Monroe, and Milledgeville offices are all still accepting intern applications for the fall semester. If you or someone you know is interested, please visit my website for more information.

JONES AND COLLEAGUES JOIN AMICUS BRIEF DEFENDING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM Congressman Walter Jones – 8/9 Last month, Congressman Walter B. Jones (NC-3) and 108 of his congressional colleagues filed an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court in support of religious freedom and the American Legion’s petition to uphold the Bladensburg Cross Memorial in Maryland. He released the following statement: “Our religious freedom is the bedrock of this country,” said Congressman Jones. “Forcing a group to tear down a cross-shaped memorial, particularly one that honors our fallen servicemembers, clearly infringes on the First Amendment. I will do everything in my power to make sure that doesn’t happen.”

August 13, 2018
Hello everyone, 
Congress is now midway into the August District Work Period, but this is no time for rest. These last few weeks I have travelled from pillar to post across the region meeting with organizations, businesses, and communities that make our state so great.
I wish folks in DC could learn a few things from the things I’ve seen over the last couple of weeks.  
Competing to Win in Our Economy 
Last week I met with the staff at the Bremerton Goodwill’s Job Training and Education Center. You might know Goodwill as a place to drop off and buy clothing, but the group also uses their earnings to help fund vocational training for folks in the community. These vocational programs have helped thousands of people from the area develop the skills they need to land jobs and succeed in the workforce.
I got to meet one of the center’s clients, Janice. She spent nearly 30 years employed as a waitress, until she was fired from her job. She wanted to get a new job, but she didn’t know how to use the touch-screen cash registers that most restaurants now require applicants to operate. 
So, through a job placement program, she heard about a cashiering course at the Goodwill. She took the class, and then she took another on how to use Word, then one on Excel, then one on customer service. She took nearly every class the Goodwill offered and realized she believed so strongly in the Goodwill’s mission, that she should work for them! For the last three years, she’s worked at the Goodwill helping customers enroll in the classes. 
￼ 
Janice is a great example of how learning new skills can help people change with our economy. While the Goodwill’s courses are free, many classes that workers are looking for aren’t. 
That’s why a few weeks ago, I introduced the Skills Investment Act of 2018. This bipartisan bill would create lifelong learning accountoptional, portable accounts to help invest in new skills. Workers and employers could opt to pay into the accounts for a tax benefit, and the account would travel with workers as they change jobs. You can read more about it here. 
There are a lot of people experiencing the same things Janice did throughout our country. They worked in one job for a long time, but when they need to find a new one they find themselves in need of new skills to be qualified. I hope Congress follows the Bremerton Goodwill’s example and makes it easier for people to learn new skills and change with the economy by passing the Skills Investment Act. 
Building Our Community 
I also had the opportunity to meet with the students and leaders of the REACH Center in Tacoma. REACH is a one-stop youth service organization that helps young people in Tacoma with everything from finding housing, to getting a GED, to applying to college or lining up a job interview.
I had a great conversation with some of the center’s students. They shared some of what they learned in the program, and their insight about the challenges people just starting out in their adult life face in our community. They gave me some ideas about how Congress can help make it easier to find affordable housing and get to work.
I told them about a group I’m in - the New Democrat Coalition - which just released a report on housing affordability. It is worth a read and can be found here.  
We also talked about the TacomaLink extension. In May, I joined with Senators Cantwell and Murray to announce a $75 million extension of the TacomaLink which will create 6 new stops and connect more neighborhoods. 
These kids were rock stars, and they’re looking for internships. If you have a business in Tacoma and you want some great applicants, call the REACH team at (253) 573-6590. 
￼ 
Washington, DC could learn a lot from the kids at the REACH center - from addressing affordable housing to investing in infrastructure, Congress can do a lot more to support people who want a reliable way to get to work, affordable housing options, and economic security.  
Working Together to Tackle Big Challenges 
Last week, I also traveled up to Forks to tag along with members of the Olympic Peninsula Forest Collaborative (OPFC). The Collaborative is a group of environmental leaders, local government officials, members of the timber industry, and tribal leaders, who shared goals that promote jobs and healthy forests on our federal land. 
For years, this group has worked hard to build consensus about the best ways to manage our region’s federal forests. They have created projects that lead to more economic opportunities through sustainable timber harvests. Additionally, these projects ultimately protect the habitats of endangered species, conserving culturally significant plants and animals, removing invasive plant species and reducing the presence of brush that fuels forest fires. 
We toured their H to Z project, the first of several projects completed by the OPFC in 2017 that helped combine timber harvests and restoration. This awesome work is a big step forward for the environment and economy of the Olympic Peninsula.  
￼ 
Washington, DC could learn a lot from the collaborative. These groups set a goal and they worked through their differences successfully. Congress needs more people like the Collaborative members who are willing to listen, respectfully disagree at times and ultimately, to deliver for their communities by building consensus. The goals of each group aren’t mutually exclusive. And when folks take the time to listen to each other and respect one another, we can make progress!
Working for You 
These last couple weeks I’ve had the opportunity to see a ton of you around our beautiful region. Here are some of my recent visits. 
Suquamish Seafood 
I recently visited the Suquamish Tribe’s Geoduck operation. Unfortunately, President Trump’s trade policies have caused China to place retaliatory tariffs on geoducks. That’s made it harder for seafood companies to sell their products abroad. In our export-dependent state economy, this is just one of many examples of the negative impacts the administration’s trade policy has on local agriculture and farmers. I will continue and push for smart policies that actually put more money in the pockets of American workers. 
￼ 
(I'm aware this is not a geoduck, but I couldn't resist not sharing it.) 
Power Paddle to Puyallup 
Over the last few weeks, thousands of people from dozens of tribes put their canoes in the water and joined the Canoe Journey. This celebration honored both their heritage as well as the theme of “Our Medicine"" - waters that have been the lifeblood of the past, and with our efforts, the future as well. I am grateful to the Puyallup Tribe for hosting this event, and want to honor all those who participated.
￼ 
NewCold 
In the middle of some record-breaking heat outside, my stop at NewCold was definitely the coolest thing I’ve done in the last two weeks. This facility is a midway point in the supply chain that sends fish from Alaska and our region to grocery store freezers around the world. NewCold’s new storage facility in Tacoma is state of the art. 
Thanks for choosing our region as a place to do business!  
￼ 
Grays Harbor County and Jefferson County Fairs 
It has been a fun couple of weeks, and we are coming up on one of my absolute favorite times of year - the time when I get to go to the county fairs across our region and eat some exotic fried food. First up this week was the Grays Harbor County Fair, where I learned alligator tastes a lot like chicken. Tess and I also had an awesome time in Port Townsend yesterday at the Jefferson County Fair (where I did not eat alligator).
￼ 
  
￼ 
That’s all for now! As always, it’s an honor to represent you. Please reach out if I can ever be of assistance.
Sincerely, 
Derek

Friends,

This week marks two years since the Great Flood, which is pretty hard to believe. Since then, we have been working toward a full recovery for our flooded friends, families, and neighbors. We've also been fighting to fix the Duplication of Benefits policy that has plagued so many of our flood victims, and I am happy to report that our bill (that has passed the House twice) could be up for a vote in the Senate soon.

Keep reading for an update on that and other important things we're working on in DC and at home.  If you have thoughts you'd like to share with me, please contact our office or fill out this survey to share how we can better represent you. 

Take Care,

An Update on Duplication of Benefits 
Lots of folks have called or written in about an update on Duplication of Benefits. I'll say it again, there’s nothing duplicative about a loan and a grant, and we have been working for 2 years to get this issue resolved - in fact, our bill to fix the Duplication of Benefits problem has passed the House TWICE. I hope the Senate acts on this quickly.

Fixing the NFIP
We can help reduce flood insurance claims by working to make threatened communities more resilient.The reality is that many of our homes and businesses have become more vulnerable to disasters, which is why we worked so hard to secure full funding for the Comite River Diversion Canal, West Shore, and other flood control projects. I recently gave a speech about this issue on the House floor - check it out above.

With the anniversary of the 2016 flood being this week, it is fitting that the Smithsonian’s acclaimed Water/Ways Exhibit will be in downtown Denham Springs for a month. This is one of the largest and most prestigious ever offered at the Old City Hall and the exhibit will be in Denham Springs August 11 through September 22, 2018. I can't wait to check it out! 

Making the Rounds in August
￼ 
One of the very first projects we worked on as a newly elected office in 2015 was helping recruit a Marine Corps JROTC program to Denham Springs High School. Last week, I joined the Yellow Jacket family to cut the ribbon on the new program. It was a great day for the entire community, and one we can all be proud of. 
￼ 
Enjoyed being a part of last week's ribbon cutting at Lake Elementary School's newly restored campus. Students in Ascension Parish headed back to school this week, and it will be a homecoming for a lot of schools that are reopening after the August 2016 flooding. It was a packed house as school leaders showed off the renovated campus to students and parents. The repairs and upgrades cost a little over $4 million. 

￼ 
We recently visited Formosa Plastics at their facility in Baton Rouge. We enjoyed engaging at the employee town hall meeting discussing transportation, flood insurance and recovery, federal regulations and other topics. 
￼ 
￼ 
It was great to have Nicholls State University President Dr. Jay Clune and his wife Allison in our Baton Rouge office this week. They continue to make Louisiana proud leading Nicholls and advancing its legacy of top-notch higher education standards in the Bayou Region. His twitter feed isn't bad either.
  
￼ 
Appreciated the time we recently spent with local small business owners at an NFIB round-table in Baton Rouge this week. Louisiana's economy is growing faster than the national average right now, and it's exciting to hear how these Capital Region job creators are helping make that happen as they invest in their people, ramp up operations and take on new initiatives to expand opportunities in the area. The new tax reform law, a more favorable business climate and the other pro-growth policies we've helped advance are making a positive difference in people’s lives.

Did you catch our Facebook Live this week?   
Did you know that in the U.S. (including Louisiana) roughly 93% of all adults get at least some news online, 7 in 10 are on social media and more than two-thirds use Facebook? The internet, social media, smartphones and other amazing technologies have made information, news and people more accessible than ever.
That’s why we use Facebook Live regularly to host interactive video town halls where I spend an hour responding in real-time to your questions, concerns and thoughts about important topics and provide updates on issues that matter most to you, Louisiana and to the nation. Facebook Live is one of the many things we do to make sure that we are talking, accessible and doing an effective job representing you.

Last Week in Congress
Jobs Numbers Show Surging Manufacturing Sector
￼ ￼ Click here to read more from CNBC
Manufacturing a key sector of our growing economy, providing quality careers and well-paying jobs to millions of Americans - including over 160,000 Kansans. Manufacturing jobs were hard hit in the Great Recession, but they have been expanding rapidly in the last year due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the rollback of harmful, unnecessary regulations. According to the latest jobs report, 37,000 manufacturing jobs were added in July, capping a 12-month expansion of 327,000 jobs. This was the largest growth in a single year since 1995. This is one more in a long list of positive indicators that show that the growing economy is helping all American workers.

It was a great way to start my week seeing off 45 drivers at UPS in Edgerton last Monday. This new facility is state of the art and part of a growing logistics hub in the Edgerton area. Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, UPS has invested $12 billion to expand their logistics network, increase pension funding, and order more aircraft to meet demands. I enjoyed talking with the UPS workers about their jobs and the effects of tax reform on them and their company.

American Wind Week at Tradewind Energy in Lenexa
￼ Kevin speaking to Tradewind Energy employees
Last year, wind power became America’s number one source of renewable energy. I am very happy to say that our great state of Kansas and our hometown company of Tradewind Energy are national leaders in this development. Last week, I joined Tradewind Energy employees for their American Wind Week event to talk about renewable energy in our state. Kansas blows away most other states by harnessing our famous prairie winds to generate a whopping 36% of our state’s energy, largely attributable to innovators like Tradewind Energy here in Lenexa. I am proud to have such innovators and leaders in renewable energy here in our community, and I am working hard to support their efforts and create a business environment that encourages innovation and fosters growth in the wind sector. Thank you to Rob Freeman for his leadership and thank you to the employees for all their questions and input.

August 7 of each year is National Purple Heart Day, honoring the brave men and women who have earned the Purple Heart through their sacrifice for our country. This day reminds us of our responsibility to uphold our end of the commitment to those who served and continue to serve in the Armed Forces. We can honor the sacrifices of Purple Heart recipients by fully funding our national defense and veterans programs, supporting our servicemembers, veterans, and their families. This year, the House has taken decisive action to make historic new investments in these initiatives, bring both defense and veterans funding to their highest levels ever. I am committed to continuing this progress and ensuring that America maintains the top military in the world.

The IRS has begun alerting veterans. More info: http://bit.ly/2M8Tisr    RepPeteOlson  On Friday, I attended the ribbon cutting for the Ivy Kids Early Learning Center in Katy! It was great to tour the facility & hear about how Ivy Kids is working hard (and playing hard) with the kids & families of #TX22.  ￼   RepPeteOlson  Great to tour Hudson Products in Beasley today! Hudson's #MadeInAmerica products are used in machines all over the world. Thanks for having me! ￼  
Dear Friend,  Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to read about some of last week’s highlights here in Texas during our district work period.  Talking Tax Reform With Local Small Businesses  On a recent tour of Rosenberg Tractor with owner Gary Allred, I learned more about their day-to-day operations and discussed tax reform. Since Congress passed and the president signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, Gary’s customers have been using their savings to invest in more equipment for their businesses, which has also helped him grow his business. Small businesses like Rosenberg Tractor are the backbone of our local TX-22 economy and I will continue to support pro-growth policies in Congress. ￼  Rep. Olson and Gary Allred, owner of Rosenberg Tractor   Providing a Legislative Update to the Rosenberg Rotary  It was an honor to join the Rosenberg Rotary Club for their bi-monthly meeting and provide an update on my work in Congress and impacts of federal legislation on our Rosenberg community. I discussed my efforts to secure funding for critical Harvey recovery projects, tax reform and my work on the Energy and Commerce Committee.   ￼  Rep. Pete Olson speaking at the Rosenberg Rotary Club meeting    Touring a Rosharon Business & Discussing Tariffs  It was a pleasure to tour Love Handle in Rosharon and meet with some of their employees. We discussed tax reform, intellectual property rights and the impact of tariffs on American manufacturers. Meetings with our TX-22 businesses allow me to hear about the issues that directly affect our businesses and workers, which helps me best represent their needs in Congress. ￼  Rep. Pete Olson and Love Handle employees    Working to Support Our TX-22 Communities  On Friday, I was privileged to attend a Pearland Chamber of Commerce Governmental Relations Committee meeting and provide an update on tax reform, healthcare and military investment. They also informed me about local issues affecting our Pearland businesses. It is critical that we work together on a local and federal level to support our Pearland community and meetings like this help us do just that. ￼  Rep. Pete Olson addresses the Pearland Chamber of Commerce Governmental Relations Committee   I'm honored to represent you in Congress.

Dear Lindsey,  According to the most recent economic growth report, our economy grew at a 4.1 percent annual rate for the second quarter, the highest growth in four years! This is a win for Western Pennsylvanians and all Americans. Our economy is finally growing at a pace that will provide better jobs, higher wages, and more opportunity for American workers. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and right-sized regulation reforms are contributing greatly to the economic turnaround. Many critics have said that 4 percent growth was a thing of the past. Republicans in Congress have shown that when Washington supports opportunity and stops stifling it with high taxes and overregulation, our economy can prosper. I recently joined Mike Emanuel with Fox News to discuss this great news. See the exchange below:
￼ 
Additionally, Senator Toomey and I supported a recent, bipartisan regulatory reform package that was signed into law. This new law right-sizes regulations to keep our community banks and local credit unions open and revitalizes our local economies. Our work was recently featured in the Pennsylvania Association of Community Bankers’ Transactions Magazine. Read HERE. 
Creating Economic Opportunity for Western Pennsylvanians 
￼   It is important to help equip our workers with the skills they need to be successful in their career fields. 
Thanks to pro-growth Republican policies, there are more jobs available than job seekers. While this is great news, many of these jobs are unfulfilled because there are not enough workers with the relevant skills and training. That is why I supported the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. Signed into law, this Act provides Western Pennsylvanians and Americans with the opportunity to obtain the training and skills needed to gain and maintain meaningful employment, and earn good wages to provide for their families.
Providing for our Military 
￼  Our men and women in uniform are standing for us. Now we must stand for them. 
Providing for a strong national defense and supporting our service members are among my most important responsibilities in Congress. I supported the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act for FY2019 to strengthen our military’s readiness, equipping them with the resources and training they need to respond to challenges in an increasingly complex and dangerous world. It also gives our troops a well-deserved pay raise – the largest in nearly a decade – and fortifies our defense capabilities to combat Chinese and Russian aggression.
Addressing the Bear in the Room 
 ￼  Listen to my House Floor remarks on Russia HERE. 
As a hawk on Russia for the past 40 years, it is not breaking news to me that Russia is an adversary to the U.S. and a threat to our values. Its government has meddled in our elections and spread disinformation to undermine our sovereignty. The reality is Vladimir Putin wants to sow discord in the West. He would cause trouble regardless of who is in the White House. I hope that my colleagues across the aisle will join me in recognizing the geopolitical threat that Russia poses to America and our allies. I also implore the President to be vigilant and heed the concerns of my fellow Republican legislators who have been engaged on Russian matters for many years.
Honoring a Western Pennsylvania Legend 
￼  It was a privilege to join Jeffrey McCaffrey, Tom Averell, Jerry Veshio, Wayne F. Alling, Rick Dunmire and Rocky Bleier. 
It was a privilege to introduce Rocky Bleier at the where Rocky was awarded the Football Hall of Fame's Leatherback Helmet Award. Rocky is a renaissance man with a lifetime of extraordinary achievements. He has led an inspiring life both on and off the field, and through his dedicated service to our nation and community, he exemplifies the traits of an American hero. Congratulations on this award, Rocky! It will be displayed for all visitors to see in the Heinz History and Sports Museum.
Facilitating Innovation 
￼  Thank you to everyone who made the RLA Learning and Conference tour possible! 
The RLA Learning and Conference Center in Cranberry Township offers space to organizations, education providers, and businesses across Western Pennsylvania to use for education and workforce development programs. This includes a preschool, a musical theater company, and the Mine Safety Appliances (MSA) Company training center. It was terrific meeting the highly competent and engaging RLA staff, and observing the reliable testing of the MSA’s safety equipment.
Supporting our Medical Resource Providers 
￼  Learning more about the Pocket Nurse’s business and brushing up on my CPR training. 
By 2022, it is projected that the U.S. will need to educate 1 million new nurses. Ensuring that our growing community of healthcare professionals are properly trained and equipped is an essential element of a high-quality health care system. Based in Beaver County, Pocket Nurse provides medical supplies and equipment for healthcare education programs and medical simulation labs made available through high schools, colleges, and universities. Our Armed Forces also use their medical kits to train their medics. Thank you to President Anthony Battaglia, Senior Corporate Director William Evanson, and their team for the enlightening tour!
If you are having issues with the IRS, Social Security, Medicare, the VA, or another part of the federal government, my staff and I are ready to help! Please drop by at one of our locations, no appointment necessary. For more information, you can call one of my offices or visit Rothfus.house.gov/contact/offices.
Thank you for taking time to keep up with the work I am doing on your behalf!

Inspiring the Next Generation of Leaders
By Sen. John Thune 
 
It’s amazing how the littlest things in life can have an outsized effect on the decisions a person makes in the future. For me, it was a missed free throw. As silly as it might sound, it’s true. 
 
It was a Friday night in Murdo, South Dakota, during the semi-final game of the annual Jones County basketball tournament. I was a freshman in high school, but I had the opportunity to play varsity ball that night, and I had a pretty good game, too. I attempted six free throws and drained all but one of them. I was (and still am) a competitive guy and would have much preferred to have gone six-for-six. Little did I know at the time, though, had it not been for that one missed free throw, I might not be serving in the U.S. Senate today. (to read the rest of this column, click here)

Nolan Presses ""No Government-No Pay"" Bill While the President Threatens Federal Shutdown Over Taxpayer Funded Mexican Wall 
￼  When the federal government shut down in 2013, so did America’s national parks. Apparently, the President would have “no problem” doing it again unless Congress appropriates $35 billion taxpayer dollars to build the southern border wall that's supposed to be Mexico's responsibility.  
Dear Friend,  
While the President is threatening to shut down the federal government unless he gets his taxpayer-funded border wall with Mexico, I’m working hard to pass my “No Government-No Pay” bill to encourage Congress to do its job, pass the necessary appropriations bills, and keep the government open past the September 30 deadline.   Simply stated, it’s time for Congress to start living in the real world, where you either do your job or you don’t get paid. That’s why I introduced the first “No Government-No Pay” Act before the October 2013 budget deadlock that shut down the government for 16 days and furloughed more than 800,000 federal employees.   The measure simply states that when Congress allows the federal government to shut down, Members would not be paid until everything is back up and running. And there would be no pay at all - ever - for the wasted days government is out of operation.   By way of background, a couple of weeks ago, the President said he would have “no problem” shutting down the federal government unless Congress agrees to spend $35 billion U.S. taxpayer dollars on a border wall that’s supposed to be Mexico’s responsibility. Apparently, that means he would refuse to sign the appropriations bills Congress must pass by September 30th in order to keep the federal government operating.  Never mind the June Gallup poll that showed 57% of Americans oppose construction of a wall across our southern border. Does the President even comprehend the consequences of shutting down the federal government?   The October 2013 shutdown debacle – engineered by Republicans over the Affordable Care Act – took $24 billion out of our economy and cost 120,000 good paying jobs. Businesses suffered, products were left sitting on our ports, military Veterans disability claims were stalled, National Parks and Head Start centers were closed and EPA hazardous waste and chemical waste inspections were postponed – just to name a few of the disastrous consequences.   Instead of building a wall with Mexico, $35 billion U.S. taxpayer dollars could fund at least 6 or 7 months of medical research at the National Institutes of Health, pay for two years of Head Start for every young child in America, sustain the Environmental Protection Agency for two years, or provide 3 million Pell grants for needy college students. In short, there are hundreds of good places to invest $35 billion in America and our people. The President’s wall just isn’t one of them. 
We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email. 
Sincerely, 
￼ 

Like an Invasive Species, Big Money is Infesting Our Politics
￼  Click on the screen above to hear me explain why big money is threatening the integrity of our democracy and our public policy making process. 
The foundation of our landmark Restore Democracy legislation lies in overturning the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision. 
The formation of our laws and policies must not be up for sale to the highest corporate bidders.Yet the hard, cold fact is that as a result of Citizens United, secret, “dark”, special interest money has infested our campaigns and elections, rigging the system for the Wall Street billionaires and powerful forces behind those contributions. We’ve got to put a stop to it. The integrity of our public policymaking process and the very survival of our democracy are at stake in this fight.  
A majority of Americans clearly agree. According to a recent poll sponsored by the Center for Public Integrity, 57% of Americans want strict limits on the amount of money political action committees (PACs) can contribute to campaigns. And in a Harvard Kennedy School poll of young people 18-29 taken earlier this year, 75 percent of Democrats and 63 percent of Republicans cite “money in politics” as a major contributor to our Nation’s problems.     Citizens United granted corporations and other legal entities the right to free speech – just as people have – under the First Amendment. By doing so, the Court opened federal election campaigns to the free flow of enormous amounts of secret “dark” money into phony advocacy groups set up by special interest contributors. Those groups, in turn, buy hateful TV ads that distort the truth, denigrate candidates, discourage voter turnout and destroy people’s confidence in our public policy making process.  Moreover, the need many members of Congress feel to spend 20 to 30 hours a week raising money to defend themselves against false and misleading campaign advertising has all but transformed Congress into little more than a mid-level telemarketing operation. With so little time left for governing, Congress has become less productive than at any time in history, while campaigns have literally become 365 day a year operations.   While we continue to build support to overturn Citizens United, Wisconsin Republican Congressman Mike Gallagher and I are working hard to build support for our bipartisan “Go to Washington – Go to Work”legislation to prohibit members of Congress and their challengers from directly asking donors for campaign money while Congress is in session When you go to Washington you should go to work on the people’s business – not your re-election campaign.   The Restore Democracy Revolution 
By themselves, any of the measures in our Restore Democracy bill would constitute a major boost for our democratic process. Taken together, they are nothing short of revolutionary in scope.   The foundation lies in putting a stop to special interests spending unlimited amounts of secret money to influence government and elections. Our legislation would also put Congress on record supporting small donor-public campaign financing and limiting the campaign season. Moreover, we are calling for full disclosure of all campaign contributions, establishment of national online voter registration and a halt to all voter suppression.  We also call for a return to Congress’s traditional process of Regular Order. Under Regular Order, wefind common ground by fully considering every idea and amendment under an open rule – and affording each one an up or down vote. That’s how Congress fixed things, solved problems and got things done for more than 200 years. It’s time to get back to that tried and true method of serving the American people.

Following Nolan's Appeal, State Agrees to Review Decision to Reinstate Mineral Leases for Mesabi Metallics
￼  The Essar Steel Minnesota project was under construction in this 2015 photo. A year later, on July 8, 2016, the company filed for bankruptcy, tying Minnesota’s mineral leases into a complex court case.  
Minnesota’s Iron Range needs a credible, proven mining company to take over the bankrupt former Essar plant in Nashwauk, and as I strongly advised Governor Dayton in a letter earlier this month, there is ample rationale to believe Mesabi Metallics does not possess the credibility or the capability to do the job. In fact, the Governor has more than ample reason to withdraw the state’s mineral leases and consider other alternatives.   There’s a lot at stake here. The simple fact is that another bankruptcy, combined with further lawsuits, could delay progress for years to come and cost the opportunity for a good, financially stable company to take over the project and create more good paying Iron Range jobs.   Shortly after receiving my message, the Governor and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources announced that they would reconsider their earlier decision to reinstate the state’s extremely valuable mineral leases to Mesabi Metallics.   As I pointed out to the Governor, my concerns over the mineral leases date back to July 2016, when Essar Steel Minnesota filed for bankruptcy - reportedly less than an hour before the lease termination notice was submitted. As a result, the State’s mineral leases at Nashwauk became tied up in a complex court case. The bankruptcy capped nearly a decade of broken promises, unpaid bills and missed opportunities while the project was under the management of entities related to Essar.   Now, as I also pointed out to Governor Dayton, Mesabi Metallics appears to be following the same playbook as Essar – broken promises, failure to pay contractors, vendors and taxes, finances not in place, and opportunistic use of the bankruptcy process at the expense of Minnesotans.   The simple fact is, we need a reputable, transparent, and experienced mining company operating the former Essar plant – under leadership that stands with our Rangers through the ups and downs of this cyclical industry. Mesabi Metallics doesn’t fill the bill. 

Eliminate Security From Small Airports? That's a Terrible Idea!
￼    We need to keep Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints at all of our small and medium-size airports to ensure the safety of our entire air transportation system.   
What a terrible idea. Under the guise of saving money, the Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) is reportedly considering eliminating security checkpoints at more than 150 small and medium-sized airports here in Minnesota and across the nation. Passengers – some 10,000 every day – would instead be screened when they arrive at larger hub airports across the nation.   Let’s be clear.  Eliminating TSA security at smaller airports would put our entire air transportation system at greater risk by encouraging potential terrorists to take off from these facilities security free – as did two of the 9/11 hijackers who began their trip from Portland, Maine. Moreover, the increased security threat would undoubtedly discourage business people, tourists and other travelers from using local and regional airports that play such an important role in growing local economies.    Over the last five and a half years in Congress, as a member of the House Transportation Committee, I’ve made it a mission to promote small airport growth and safety. Under our watch, local and regional airports in Minnesota’s 8th District have received millions of dollars in federal grants to improve runways and other vital facilities. Last year, we restored $10 million in cuts the Administration had proposed to Essential Air Service, a program to help support small airport development.   Here’s the bottom line. We need to keep making all of our airports safer – not more vulnerable to those who seek to harm us. When Congress returns to Washington in September, I will be helping to lead the effort to put a stop to any future plans by the TSA to jeopardize security at our small airports.  

Grant Watch: A $22.5 Million Boost for Head Start Programs in Minnesota's 8th District
￼  Since January 2018, eight Head Start programs in Minnesota’s 8th district have been awarded a total of nearly $22.5 million in discretionary funding. The funds emanate from U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration and the U.S. Health and Human Services Administration for Children and Families Office of Head Start.  
All across America, economically challenged families are struggling to find affordable educational and child care services.  According to the Centers for American Progress, 20 percent of the children living in rural Minnesota under the age of 5 live in poverty, making it difficult for their parents to find affordable, dependable childcare services.   So I'm working hard to change that situation with strong and consistent advocacy for programs like Head Start and Early Head Start – providing children and their families with a safe learning environment, parenting education, health education, job training, and substance abuse prevention.  As a former director of the North Central Minnesota 19-unit Head Start program, I’ve seen first-hand the significant impact these programs have for both children and their families and our economy. Across rural Minnesota, Head Start operates 228 classrooms in 186 centers employing 3,579 people – and funds enrollment for 12,594 children.    To help keep you updated, we will be using the Monday Report to highlight important federal grants for the 8th District. I’m particularly pleased to report this new discretionary funding to aid low-income rural Minnesota families with child care services and combat child poverty:       • Duluth Public School District #709 - $2,324,301       • Lakes & Pines Community Action Council, Inc. – $2,929,966       • Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa - $2,036,772       • Bi-County Community Action Programs, Inc. - $2,948,986       • Arrowhead Economic Opportunity Agency, Inc. -$3,480,131       • Kootasca Community Action, Inc. - $2,273,443       • Tri-County Community Action Partnership, Inc. – $4,749,038       • Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe - $1,635,909 

Our Week in Crosslake
￼  The family showed up in Crosslake to cheer for Katherine and her daughter, Sadie, participating in the annual Community fund raising cardboard boat races at Moonlight Bay. They made a good showing! 
Our Week in Duluth
￼  United States Senator Tina Smith held a Health Care Cost panel with executives from the local hospitals. medical centers, and the University of Minnesota Duluth Medical School. Topics of conversation included transportation issues, the Affordable Care Act, mental health, and substance abuse prevention. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Hannah Alstead attended on my behalf. 
Our Week in North Branch 
￼  Communities across northern Minnesota and the country celebrated and participated in National Night Out last week. The event is an annual community-building campaign that promotes police-community partnerships and neighborhood camaraderie to make our neighborhoods safer, more caring places to live. The North Branch Fire and Emergency Medical Service (EMS) crews showed up in full force for the community gathering.  
￼  National Night Out youth participants also demonstrated their Taekwondo skills to spectators at the event. Here they are showing off their high-kick self defense techniques.  
Our Week in Chisago
￼  The Chisago Lakes Chamber held their August meeting at Ojiketa Park in Chisago City. Bill Mack, known by locals as a super volunteer, is giving a presentation on the Chisago Lakes Water Trail. The trail provides locals with access to 10 lakes for recreational purposes.  
Our Week in Chisholm 
￼  Senior Citizens Centers are always a great place to have conversations and learn about issues facing constituents across my district. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tom Whiteside stopped by the Chisholm Senior Center to meet and hear from locals about issues most important to them. Topics of discussion included making health care and education more affordable, putting an stop to endless wars of choice, and investing in our Nation's infrastructure. Pictured above are a group of locals who regularly gather to socialize at the Chisholm Senior Center. 

Finally...
August 13, 1967 - Twins Take Over First Place in Baseball's Tightest Pennant Race!
￼  Fifty-one years ago today, some 42,418 fans packed Metropolitan Stadium to watch the Minnesota Twins defeat the Chicago White Sox and take over first place during one of the most exciting pennant races in baseball history. 
The Twins are struggling this season, but no so 51 years ago today as they took over first place for the first time in 1967 with a 3-2 win over the White Sox at the Met in front of 42,418 baseball fans. At the end of the day, only 2.5 games separated the top five teams in the American League with the Twins, White Sox, Tigers, Angels and Red Sox knotted in one of the tightest pennant races in baseball history. Rich Rollins knocked in all three Twins Runs, and Jim Merritt pitched a complete game for his ninth win of the season.

Earlier this summer, on the very same day GM laid off workers at its historic plant in Lordstown, we got word that GM plans to build its new Chevy Blazer in Mexico – the company is bypassing American workers and sending more jobs to Mexico.  In 2010, we worked hard to save the American auto industry, including GM, because we knew what these plants and this industry means to communities in Ohio and across the country.  But announcements like this one are proof that we need to do more to keep auto jobs in the U.S. and stop rewarding companies that send jobs overseas.  That’s why I introduced legislation to help us level the playing field with foreign competition, by making it more affordable for Americans to buy American-made cars and trucks, and revoking a special GOP tax cut for auto companies that send jobs overseas.  My bill, the American Cars, American Jobs Act, has two simple parts:  First, customers who buy cars that are made in the U.S. get $3,500 off. The discount would apply to nearly 100 cars, trucks, and SUVs, including all passenger vehicles assembled in Ohio.   Second, auto companies that cut the number of American jobs they had on the day the GOP tax bill passed and add those jobs overseas, lose a special tax break they get on their overseas profits.   In their tax giveaway to corporations last year, Republicans in Congress gave companies new tax incentives to close auto plants here in the U.S. and ship those jobs to Mexico or other foreign countries. This happened because their tax bill allowed companies to pay just 10.5 percent in taxes on some of their overseas profits, instead of the full 21 percent corporate rate. That’s like handing out 50 percent off coupons to companies that send jobs overseas.  This bill puts a stop to that. It says that if you choose to send jobs overseas, you lose that coupon and pay the full 21 percent. On the other hand, if you keep jobs in the U.S., you keep your discount.   The world was reminded eight years ago to never bet against the American auto industry and the workers who are the engine behind it.  We invested in saving this industry, yet we have a trade and tax policy set up to undermine it.  This legislation will work to change that, leveling the playing field for American cars and American workers.

Dear Lindsey, 
As your Representative, I am always inspired by the young advocates who stop in to meet with me, and last week I was delighted to meet Sri Jaladi, a sophomore at Parkway West High School. Over the past year, he has written numerous Letters to the Editor, which have been published in various newspapers. I enjoyed discussing the increasing popularity of cryptocurrency and how it presents new, unforeseen challenges for financial regulators. I also met with Michelle Cooper, a patient advocate for the Lupus Foundation, and representatives of the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Society, including the Executive Director Eric Page, to discuss how I can best support them in Congress as they conduct research and treatment efforts for these unpredictable and difficult diseases.        
Supporting the diverse groups within our community is a top priority for me in Congress. St. Louis’s thriving Bosnian community is well known at home and abroad, and last week I met with the President of the St. Louis Bosnian Association, Akif Cogo, and President of the St. Louis Islamic Center, Alija Dzekic, to discuss the current crises occurring in Bosnia. Russia continues to exercise its influence, looking to create tension and prevent Bosnia from entering the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). I believe the United States, European Union, and NATO need to boost their diplomatic engagement and military presence through the upcoming election in Bosnia to combat Russian influence. I am happy to say the National Defense Authorization Act that my colleagues and I recently passed authorizes the Secretary of Defense to do just that.

I am incredibly honored to fight alongside many courageous men and women as we battle to prevent human trafficking in our streets, neighborhoods, and cities. I connected with dozens of anti-trafficking advocates from across Missouri as they joined me for another update on steps Congress is taking to combat sex trafficking. The Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) continues to impact lives in our community and encourage more survivors to seek services, and together I am confident that we can provide a voice for the most vulnerable.

Yesterday, I was able to celebrate a second Independence Day! It was my privilege to join the India Association of St. Louis as they commemorated India’s independence from the British Empire in 1947. The Indian-American community has made tremendous contributions to St. Louis and Missouri, and are leaders in business, medicine, education, law, and many other fields. Most of all, the association enhances the rich family-centered culture of Missouri. Families make our communities stronger, and I am proud to represent the thousands of Indian families who contribute to our sense of identity.

This past week, golf enthusiasts from around the world descended on St. Louis to watch the historic 100th PGA Championship at Bellerive Country Club. The economic impact is tremendous for St. Louis and the surrounding region; early estimates are already over $100 million. I couldn’t be more proud that this event took place in Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District. Congratulations to the winner, Brooks Koepka!

Dear Friend,   Community Leaders and Concerned Citizens Meet to Discuss Wildfire Smoke 
￼ 
Southern Oregon concerned citizens, small business owners, and local leaders discuss the impact of wildfire smoke on public health and on our economy 
Year after year, people in the West are suffering from the effects of catastrophic wildfires and the smoke that comes with it. People end up having to wear masks, stay inside, and events are canceled. As a life-long Oregonian, I know summers weren’t like this in the past.  For those who say this is “the new normal,” I say “baloney.”   
This spring, I helped secure some of the most significant reforms to federal forest policy in over a decade, including a fix to make sure the Forest Service doesn’t have to rob forest prevention accounts to pay for firefighting costs.   
Now, we have an opportunity to do even more. I worked to secure additional changes in the Farm Bill that passed the House recently, such as: 
	•	Harvesting the burned dead trees (where appropriate) after a fire and using the proceeds to plant a new forest for the next generation;
	•	Expediting response to insect and disease infestation, watershed protection, hazardous fuels reduction, and forest restoration; and
	•	Streamlining collaborative projects in the forests.
While the Senate failed to include these provisions in their version of the Farm Bill, it’s not too late for them to agree to all or some of these common-sense reforms in the final package. We especially need help from east coast Senators who ignore our problems all too often.

Concerned citizens pass smoke solutions to Congressman Walden 
 Southern Oregon citizens fed up with the smoke have formed a committee and U.S. Congressman Greg Walden was in town to listen. 
The group, representing a wide range of industries including logging, tourism, and real estate shared their ideas and concerns with the Congressman.

Walden Announces Hearing to Examine Health Impact of Wildfire Smoke 
￼ 
As Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I announced a hearing in September to look at the horrible health consequences of the smoke from these catastrophic wildfires. Click here to view my announcement.  
Southern Oregon shouldn’t suffer from some of the worst air quality in the world. People should not have to wear masks to go outside, or to breathe inside their own homes. Families shouldn’t feel like they are “hostages” in their own homes, as a mother from Medford recently described how her family is coping with hazardous air quality yet again this summer. Yet we are living through all of that as Oregonians, and the consequences are serious.
In an effort to build support across the country for the changes in forest management and firefighting that are needed, I will use my position as Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee to examine the air quality impacts of wildfire smoke. This hearing will call attention to the negative effects wildfires have on our airsheds, environment, and the health of our communities. 
We will also address the underlying causes of these unnaturally catastrophic wildfires, and the need to reduce the fuels that have built up in our forests for decades. Recent studies have shown that active management of fire fuels can reduce the size and intensity of wildfires by up to 70 percent and the carbon emissions of wildfires by up to 85 percent. That is something we can all get behind. Who wants to live through more summers with smoke suffocating our communities?

Walden Hears from Klamath County Veterans, Gives Update on Increased Help from Congress 
￼ 
It is always an honor to sit down with those who have worn our nation’s uniform. In Klamath Falls, I met with a group of veterans to discuss how we can make sure they are receiving the care and support they’ve earned and deserve from the VA.  Last year alone, my office helped 578 Second District veterans with issues regarding disability pay, benefits, and health care. 
The House also provided historic funding for the VA to ensure they have the resources they need to boost mental health, opioid addiction, and suicide prevention programs. And we’ve secured landmark reforms through the VA MISSION Act, which strengthens the VA and improves care for our veterans. Importantly, this law includes a provision I authored to bring medical scribes into the VA system. In the private health care sector medical scribes take the notes while the medical provider remains focused on the patient. It has resulted in a 59% increase in the number of patients doctors can see per hour in the private sector, and we want to bring that success to our veterans and the VA system.
Thank you to the veterans who joined the roundtable in Klamath Falls for taking the time to meet with me, and for your service to our country. 
At a meeting organized by the Klamath County Chamber of Commerce, we discussed the positive impacts the tax cuts and regulatory reductions are having on small businesses. Having owned and operated a business from more than 20 years in our district, I know firsthand what it’s like to comply with government regulations, pay taxes, and grow jobs. 
As with other meetings, this one quickly focused on the horrible impacts of smoke from the wildfires.   
￼
  
Walden talks poor air quality, extreme wildfire season during latest visit 
Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., went right into air quality talks during his latest stop in Klamath Falls, saying that current levels are “probably worse than Beijing.” 
“You can’t even go outside,” said Walden, who had also just come from a meeting with business leaders in Medford.

Ranchers Meet in Lakeview to Discuss Upcoming Farm Bill and Regulatory Reform 
￼ 
Lake County farmers, ranchers, and community leaders discussed grazing, forestry and firefighting issues, among other topics during a meeting in Lakeview.   
The groundbreaking last month of the $320 million Redrock Biofuels facility means we’ll have a market for the woody biomass from the surrounding forests.  And with the change in the law allowing for 20-year stewardship contracts, biomass users will have an increased level of supply certainty. This and other changes we’re working on will help grow jobs in our rural communities, provide alternative fuel and energy sources, and clean up the woods. 
On the ranching front, we have much more work ahead to make needed reforms to the Equal Access to Justice Act to bring transparency and reduce frivolous lawsuits that impact our way of life in the West. We’re also working on federal management plans -- from one end of this giant district to the other -- to make sure ranchers have access to grazing allotments.
Medical Providers, Law Enforcement Gather in Bend to Discuss Combating the Opioid Crisis with FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. 
￼
Thank you to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb (to my left at head of table) for joining me in Bend for a roundtable discussion with local law enforcement and medical providers to discuss efforts to combat the opioid crisis. We need an all-hands-on-deck approach to win this fight. 
Combating the opioid crisis that is killing 115 Americans every day is going to require a full-team effort from all of us. That’s why I brought FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb to Bend to meet with local law enforcement officers and medical providers to hear firsthand how Oregonians are working together to stem the tide and save lives.
In June, the House passed my legislation -- the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act -- to advance treatment and recovery initiatives, improve prevention, protect our communities, and bolster our efforts to fight deadly illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl. This bipartisan legislation passed the House by a vote of 396-14, and represents the largest Congressional effort to address a single drug crisis in history. 
But our efforts do not stop there. Recently, I pressed the nation’s top opioid makers about their potential role in the crisis. I will continue listening to and working with those most involved in our communities to find solutions to end this scourge.

Walden holds Bend roundtable on opioid epidemic 
Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., held a roundtable Tuesday morning in Bend with law enforcement and medical professionals to discuss the opioid abuse crisis and ways to tackle the problem. 
Doctors from Mosaic Medical expressed an interest in expanding prescription drug ""take-back"" programs across the state, drawing nods of agreement from Deschutes County Sheriff Shane Nelson and Bend Police Chief Jim Porter.

FDA Commissioner Talks Food Safety with Farmers in Central Oregon 
￼ 
Following our opioid roundtable in Bend, I organized an on-the-farm tour and discussion with Commissioner Gottlieb and local farmers to discuss the FDA’s implementation of the Food Safety Modernization Act.  
Having grown up on a cherry orchard in The Dalles, I learned the importance of food safety and good farm practices at an early age. When central Oregon brewers ran into Washington, D.C. bureaucrats a few years back regarding feeding spent grains to cows, I got involved and helped solve the problem.  As a result, the spent grain from beer making provides healthy feed for cows which in turn provides beef products to local restaurants.

FDA chief reassures Oregon growers over FSMA concerns 
Oregon fresh produce growers got some reassuring words from U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb during a stop Tuesday near Bend, Ore. 
Implementation of the Food Safety Modernization Act has loomed over the fresh produce industry since the law was signed by former President Barack Obama more than seven years ago.

Top Department of Interior Water Official Visits Central Oregon Canals 
￼
Alan Mikkelsen (center-right in green hat) visits central Oregon irrigation projects. 
Last week, I brought the top water official with the Department of the Interior to central Oregon to get a firsthand look at the innovative water projects in central Oregon and to hear from local irrigators. We visited several sites in the Bend area, including a newly piped project that saves water for fish while providing a new recreation path for walkers and bikers.  Alan Mikkelsen is a familiar face on the ground in Oregon as we work together on challenging water issues in both the Klamath and the Deschutes basins. I appreciate his engagement on matters of such importance to our communities.
Irrigators in central Oregon are leaders in creative and collaborative solutions that ensure water for farms, fish, and spotted frogs. Central Oregon’s canal piping projects help our local irrigators conserve water and protect fish and wildlife.  
￼ 
Federal Officials Tour Bend Canal Piping Project 
The canal piping project near Bends' Brookswood neighborhood is now in the beautification stage. Federal officials toured the site Wednesday, along with representatives from the Central Oregon Irrigation District.  
COID has finished piping a 3,000-linear foot section of its main canal, in a joint three-month project with the Department of Reclamation. Parks and Recreation will soon develop biking and recreational trails in the area. During Wednesday's tour, Congressman Greg Walden (R-OR) and Department of the Interior Senior Advisor Alan Mikkelsen learned about the project and the effort to conserve water. ""From fish and frogs to farmers and recreators, it all comes together right here in these types of projects,"" said Walden.

Health Care: A 2018 Checkup
On August 7, the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) announced a $500,000 grant to the Health Wagon for construction of a health care clinic in Clintwood.
Some people think Obamacare is the only thing that matters when it comes to health care, but as this recent good news from ARC reminds us, there is plenty of activity occurring elsewhere in federal health policy.
Other federal programs related to health care and other problems in the field deserve our attention. As a member of the Health Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, I have been able to engage in hands-on work related to this subject.
Start with the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Since 1997, CHIP has drawn wide bipartisan support in its mission to provide health insurance to low-income children. When the time came to reauthorize CHIP in 2017, the Republican majority made a determined effort to extend the program.
We advanced it from the Energy and Commerce Committee to the House floor. It passed by a vote of 242-174, with Republicans providing 227 of the votes in favor. Under Senate rules, a minority obstructed this bill, but in another rules maneuver by the Senate, CHIP was eventually reauthorized and signed into law. In fact, its ten-year reauthorization is the longest in the program’s history.
Our work ensured that millions of low-income children would continue to be covered. This is a huge relief to many families in the Ninth District, which had an estimated 22,189 children covered by the program in 2016.
Also reauthorized this year: federally-funded Community Health Centers. For people lacking health insurance, especially those residing in rural areas, these centers are vital for care.
Community Health Centers have a strong presence in the Ninth District. According to 2017 data provided by the National Association of Community Health Centers, 31 sites in our communities served more than 76,000 patients. You can find one near you by visiting findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/.
Reauthorizing Community Health Centers was included with CHIP, so it passed on the same 242-174 vote in the House with Republican majority support as noted above. Ultimately, we were able to send it to President Trump’s desk.
Extending CHIP and Community Health Centers made sure these important programs continue to serve. But programs that do not presently require reauthorization deserve our attention as well. Oversight by my committee is important to understanding many problems in health care, and we have been conducting rigorous oversight to see that federal laws and programs are working as intended or to understand matters that may require action.
A recent Health Subcommittee hearing on mental health provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act fell into the former category. When working on Cures, I advocated for more funding and better coordination for mental health services. Since they were included in Cures and the bill became law, the Health Subcommittee is doing its oversight and recently heard testimony from the Assistant Secretary of Department of Health and Human Services tasked with implementing these mental health reforms.
Constituents frequently encourage me to take action to improve mental health services, and hearings such as these help us gather information and make sure we are headed in the right direction. 
Other hearings covered important subjects such as public health, state efforts to increase health transparency, and reports of patient brokering in the substance use treatment industry. These types of hearings often bear fruit by guiding legislative efforts.
We continue to vote on bills that will help improve health care. One subject that has made recent legislative progress is palliative care, which can provide great relief to people afflicted with serious illnesses. We recently advanced a bill through the House with the aim of improving available palliative care, by providing grants for training, research, and promoting awareness.
Our work discussed in this column does not include the attention devoted to the opioid epidemic, a subject I have discussed at length before. While the items mentioned above are just some of the health care issues we are working on, they and many others are a part of our effort to make health care better.
It is true that they do not generate the same interest or passion as Obamacare. But they nevertheless loom large in the lives of many. Ask the families with children still insured by CHIP, or the patients cared for by Community Health Centers.
Legislation or oversight work that may not have drawn many headlines this year still made a great difference to benefit the health and well-being of Americans.

￼
￼

Dear Friends,  
August is my favorite month of summer. The days are still long and there’s an excitement in the air as kids get busy preparing for a new school year. Last week was also a busy week across the district, including hosting a job fair in Round Lake, a health care fair in Waukegan, and a “Commuter Town Hall” on the Pace Suburban Bus from Golf Mill Mall in Niles to Hawthorne Mall in Vernon Hills. I also visited the school lunch program at Indian Trails Library in Wheeling, the Latino Coalition of Lake County lunch at the Waukegan Library, and the Illinois Education Alliance Retired Teachers lunch in Lake Bluff. Of course, it wouldn’t be summer without stopping by an art fair and some back-to-school picnics over the weekend. All in all, it was a really good week to be home.
Speaking of back to school, I am pleased to announce our district will again be participating in the Congressional App Challenge for students. Read on below for more details on how to apply! 
CONGRESSIONAL APP CHALLENGE 
￼ 
The Congressional App Challenge is a national contest that encourages middle and high school students to learn science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) skills by coding their own app for any digital device. 
The Challenge is open to all middle and high school students who live or attend school in the Tenth District, regardless of skill level. Students can choose to participate individually or as part of a team of up to 4 students, as long as two of the team members meet eligibility requirements.
To enter, participants must upload a video showcasing their app and an explanation of what they learned throughout the app-making process. 
App submissions will be accepted through Noon EST, Monday, October 15, 2018. Try to register before September 10, 2018 (registration indicates your intent to compete). Early registration significantly increases the chances for a successful challenge. Early registration does not obligate you to submit an app.
I can’t wait to see what you create! 
More information is available on our website.

WEEKLY WRAP-UP  
￼ 
I helped welcome attendees to our job fair in Round Lake with State Sen. Melinda Bush and more than 45 area employers. It was a great success and many people reported receiving job offers on the spot. 
  
￼ 
I hosted a Health Care Fair at Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe Church in Waukegan on Saturday. It was a beautiful day with hundreds of attendees receiving free health screenings, health information and more. Thanks to all the wonderful providers who joined us to help make the day a great success, and again thanks to Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe Church for being such a gracious host. 
  
￼ 
I am always looking for new ways to connect and meet with constituents. During the 115th Congress, we’ve done more than 40 town halls (in person and over the phone). And last week I did my third “Commuter Town Hall” riding the Pace Suburban Bus Route 272 from Niles to Vernon Hills. After some initial surprise of meeting their Congressman on the bus, we had wonderful conversations about health care, social security, and of course, transportation. 
  
￼ 
I had a great discussion with the North Lake Chapter of the Illinois Education Association – Retired on everything from school safety to tariffs. Thanks for letting me stop by. 
  
￼ 
I was honored to join the Coalición Latinos Unidos de Lake County (CLULC) for lunch at the Waukegan Public Library to share an update on the economy, immigration reform and a variety of other issues. 
  
￼ 
It was a great privilege to join Arden Shore in celebrating their work and their extraordinary volunteers in support of foster families. 
 
￼ 
It was great to be with residents of Lake Forest Place. This is always one of my favorite visits of the year to hear and learn from the residents. 
 
￼ 
I also had wonderful conversations with students at New Hope and Trinity churches in Waukegan getting ready for the school year. 
  
￼
Finally, it was so much fun to showcase some of the Tenth District student artists that participated in the Congressional Art Competition at the Lincolnshire Art Festival. We have very talented and creative young people in our communities! 
Thanks for reading!  I hope your week was a good one as well.      
Sincerely,

Promoting patient-centric health care

Dear Lindsey,
I wanted to reach out and let you know about my recent work to help better our health care system and the lives of Minnesotans.
Over the past few months, Congress has worked on numerous pieces of legislation to improve health care training, facilities, access, and more.
Recently, I joined my Democratic colleague Matt Cartwright as the lead Republican on the Organ Donor Clarification Act. For every organ transplant, almost two people are added to the organ waiting list, so it’s critical that Congress work to improve the donation process. Currently, uncertainties in law have blocked living donors from receiving reimbursements for lost wages, child care, travel, and other expenses associated with donating an organ.  The bipartisan Organ Donor Clarification Act updates outdated laws to:        - Allow living donors to receive reimbursements for these expenses.       - Allow local and state governments to try new and innovative pilot programs to encourage organ donation.  Increasing organ donation will not only saves lives, it will also help reduce health care costs. Experts project that eliminating the waiting list would save taxpayers well in excess of $5.5 billion per year in medical costs and billions of dollars more in savings to other programs.
Additionally, I’ve been working on Minnesotans’ behalf to help make health care more affordable by co-sponsoring the Bipartisan HSA Improvement Act of 2018. More than 175 million Americans receive their health insurance through their employer, and over 21 million Americans are enrolled in HSA (health savings account) plans. The Bipartisan HSA Improvement Act amends current law and regulations to expand the program in many ways including, but not limited to:        - Giving Americans more control over their health care dollars.       - Permitting spouses to use HSA dollars.       - Ensuring patients can access telehealth services.       - Permitting preventative care coverage to include care and prescription medicines for the treatment of medically complex chronic conditions.   Furthermore, I recently supported the passage of two bills to expand, modernize, and improve access to HSAs. The Restoring Access to Medication and Modernizing Health Savings Accounts Act and the Increasing Access to Lower Premium Plans and Expanding Health Savings Accounts Act will help empower families to have more control over their health care dollars and decisions. I’m proud to work for affordable and innovative care for Minnesotans and Americans across the country.
Just weeks ago the House passed the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act (PCHETA), of which I am a cosponsor. Most Americans, including myself, know firsthand how important palliative and hospice care is for our friends and loved ones facing advanced and serious illnesses. This bill increases research into palliative and hospice care and helps ensure our health care professionals have the training and education to support these families.
Delivering quality health care to Minnesotans is a top priority of mine, and I will continue to work on bettering our health care system for you and your neighbors in the Second District.
As I work on this and other issues, I always like to hear directly from you.  Please share any thoughts you may have through my website, and sign up for my e-mail newsletter for the latest updates from Washington, D.C. and around the district. You can also stay on top of my work by following my Facebook and Twitter pages. Please feel free to call my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-2271 or my local Burnsville office at 651-846-2120 with any comments or for assistance with a federal agency.

Dear Friend,
 
Did you know that, for the first time ever, America has more job openings than job seekers? It's just one of a growing list of stats and data points that demonstrate our economy is on a roll. 
4.1 percent growth. Unemployment near the lowest levels since the 1960's. Small business optimism at record highs. These are all things that two or three years ago, most economists believed would never happen. But because of pro-growth tax reform, and smart, targeted rollbacks of regulatory red tape, our economy is booming -- and Minnesota families are benefiting as a result. 
Below are just a few of the indicators that show just how strong our economy is, and what they mean for a middle-income family in Minnesota. It's not always a story the media likes to tell -- but it's good news, and it's important.
If you have a question or comment for me, you can send an email on my website or reach out through my Facebook or Twitter. You can also follow me on Instagram here.

“By nearly every standard measure, the American economy is doing well — and better than it was a year and a half ago. . .” (The New York Times, 8/10/18)

 
4.1 Percent Growth
GDP growth is the simplest measure of the strength of our economy: just how fast is our economy growing? The U.S. economy is expanding at an annualized rate of 4.1 percent -- that means our national economic output is expanding by more than $760 billion over the course of a year.
At the moment, household spending is the biggest contributor to our growth, a sign that families are confident in their financial situation and comfortable making purchases. Another big contributor to our 4.1 percent growth rate is business spending on capital investments. More business investment means more jobs and higher wages. 
 
￼
 
 
More Job Openings Than Job Seekers
For the first time since record-keeping began, there are more job openings in the United States than Americans seeking work. This is a big deal: it means that the American economy has sufficient bandwith to employ everyone looking for a job.
And this economy is leaving no one behind: the unemployment rate for those without high school diplomas is at its lowest ever and those who want to work full-time but can only find part-time employment is the lowest since December 2007.
To be sure, there are challenges that remain. I hear frequently from employers who say they struggle to find job applicants that have the skills or qualifications they're looking for. Equiping American workers with the skills they need for the modern workforce will be an important part of ensuring continued economic prosperity. 
 
 
Small Business Optimism at Record Highs
American small business owners are more optimistic now than at any point in the history of the Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index.  78 percent of small business owners rate their current financial situation as somewhat or very good -- that's up from 73 percent in the second quarter of last year. Small business owners also speak highly of their cash flow and credit availability -- two key indicators of future growth and expansion.
Small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy, and small firms are responsible for two out of every three net new jobs created since 1993. The owners of these firms have their fingers on the pulse of our economy, and their optimism about the future is an important sign that the fundamentals of the U.S. economy are strong.
 
￼
 
Capital Investment Accelerating 
""Domestic capital expenditures are accelerating"" -- sounds like a lot of complicated economist jargon, right? Here's what it means: American businesses are pumping more and more money back into our economy through investments in state of the art equipment, more land and new buildings to accomodate growth, and other critical assets.
Capital investment is an important leading indicator. It shows that businesses are ramping up their operations and preparing to grow, expand and hire. 
Capital spending by U.S. businesses had been essentially stagnant at the end of the Obama Administration, but it has taken off over the last year and a half.

Worker pay rate hits highest level since 2008
""Compensation for workers rose to a nearly 10-year high in the second quarter...
...The employment cost index increased 0.6 percent for civilian workers in the three-month period ending in June...That brought the 12-month rate up to 2.8 percent, the highest level since 2.9 percent in the third quarter of 2008, amid the financial crisis and the Great Recession.""

Wicker Highlights New Designations, Investments in Mississippi
Events Across the State Seek to Preserve the Past and Prepare for the Future
In June, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the Senate would not take its usual state work period in August.  Instead, lawmakers would have one week to travel home before returning to Washington to resume consideration of President Trump’s nominees. Earlier this summer, I had joined several of my colleagues to call on the Majority Leader to make this change, given the excessive delay tactics used by Democrats to stall the confirmations of nominees.  Despite a shorter schedule at home in Mississippi, the past week was well spent in the Delta, on the Gulf Coast, and in our capital city, where I participated in events honoring Mississippi leaders, unveiling exciting new technology, and celebrating our state’s rising economic potential.
Interior Secretary Visits Jackson for Designation of Evers’ Home
A particularly powerful event was the designation of the Medgar and Myrlie Evers’ home as part of the African American Civil Rights Network.  The legislation creating this network was signed into law by President Trump last year.  The goal is to ensure the many significant places of the civil rights movement will continue to share the stories of this pivotal time in our nation’s history.  The Evers’ home in Jackson deserves to be included in this network, and I am glad Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke came to Mississippi to take part in the designation ceremony.  
Last year, the Evers’ home became a national historic landmark, and I hope to see it become a national monument.  Earlier this year, I introduced a bill with Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith calling for this prestigious designation by the National Park Service.  Not only would this raise the home’s visibility nationwide, but it would also provide additional resources for its preservation.  
Another notable event to take place in Jackson was the naming of the federal courthouse, which will now be called the Thad Cochran United States Courthouse.  Congress passed the legislative measure to name the building after Sen. Cochran shortly after his retirement earlier this year.  
Positive Developments for Economic Growth, Defense, and Public Safety
In the Delta, I joined Mississippians to celebrate yet another sign that our state continues to have strong business appeal.  The groundbreaking on August 10 of a new hotel by Hilton in Greenville is a testament to the booming tourism of the region, fueled in no small part by the popular GRAMMY Museum Mississippi and Mississippi Blues Trail. 
On the Mississippi Gulf Coast, I had a positive discussion with members of the Hancock County Port and Commission about South Mississippi’s leadership in strengthening our nation’s defense.  Our conversation came on the heels of the Senate sending the annual defense bill to the President’s desk to become law.  That bill contains a number of wins that will impact Camp Shelby, Keesler Air Force Base, Stennis Space Center, and Ingalls Shipbuilding.
Across the state, Mississippians can also look forward to the development of a Mississippi Center for Emergency Services at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.  On August 9, the center’s groundbreaking was a major step in a years-long process to connect our emergency responders in a high-tech network.  The ability to share data can equip first responders with vital details about an emergency before they even arrive, helping to save more lives. 
These events have already made for a significant month in our state, and I hope they are a precursor to more good news.  These recognitions and investments are the product of hard work and dedication by many Mississippians to see their communities succeed.

The Daily Reflector: A decade of work realized: G.K. Butterfield Transportation Center open to public  
With more than a decade of planning, 22 months of construction, $8.4 million and the cutting of a ribbon, leaders said public transportation in Greenville has taken a massive step forward. Hundreds of supporters, stakeholders and facilitators gathered in the blistering sun Wednesday morning to open the G.K. Butterfield Transportation Center in the city’s booming Dickinson Avenue corridor. Buses will begin using the facility today. The center’s namesake, U.S. Rep G.K. Butterfield, who was honored on behalf of his efforts to secure state and federal grants responsible for a majority of the center’s funding, told guests its construction is evidence of a joint effort and dedication to the city’s future. “You see today is not about me, as tempting as that may be, it is about the citizens in Greenville, their quality of life, and their future,” he said. “This project demonstrates that we have visionary leadership in Greenville, not just elected officials but city staff, past and present, who understand the importance of enhancing Greenville’s infrastructure and planning for the decades to come.” […]

Dear Friend,
At the beginning of this week, Nevada lost a great public servant whose career spanned four decades - Paul Laxalt. Paul was a friend and a mentor, and he epitomized the very best Nevada had to offer by putting service above self. He served confidante to numerous Nevadans as his wealth of knowledge steered many of us to seek his valued advice and insight. His down-to-earth, kind demeanor was befitting of his campaign slogan of choice, “One of Us.” Paul was a son of Nevada and indeed one of us. My thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Paul as we mourn his passing.
￼ 
Courtesy of UNR: Paul Laxalt and Ronald Reagan. 
This week, I traveled throughout Nevada and my week began at the Nevada Museum of Art in Reno with Google, local businesses, and job seekers at a Grow with Google event. This free, one-day event was designed to help small businesses, students, educators, and entrepreneurs strengthen their digital skills. I believe that there’s no better place for a Grow with Google event than Nevada - a state that went from having one of the worst unemployment rates during the recession to now being one of the fastest growing states in the nation. 
￼ 
Speaking wiith Luke Jacobson of Moment Skis at Grow with Google in Reno.  
Nevada’s economic success is no accident - our state has created an environment that is friendly to businesses. We have diversified the industries coming into Nevada, and we have provided opportunities for companies to quickly establish facilities and start hiring. I’ll continue to do everything that I can in Washington, D.C. to capitalize on Nevada’s economic success and support our small businesses and entrepreneurs.
￼ 
Members of the Neavda and California delegations gather for the bipartisan annual Tahoe Summit. 
On Tuesday, I was honored to host the 22nd annual bipartisan Tahoe Summit at Sand Harbor State Park in Incline Village. U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Chairman of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and Chairman of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, delivered the keynote address, and several members of the Nevada and California delegations, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), and Rep Mark Amodei (NV-02), participated in the Tahoe Summit.
￼ 
Thanking all of the young individuals who are spending their time working hard for the U.S. Forest Service this summer. 
Much of this year’s summit focused on wildfire prevention and my bipartisan Lake Tahoe Restoration Act, legislation that was crafted to protect the Lake Tahoe Region by improving water clarity, reducing wildfire threats, jumpstarting innovative transportation and infrastructure projects, and combating invasive species. Last week, I was proud to announce announce that I secured $12 million in federal funding to implement his Lake Tahoe Restoration Act in a spending measure approved by the U.S. Senate.
Furthermore, as we did last year, we’ll continue to make sure that organizations - like AlertTahoe – and others, are able to use new and emerging technologies to detect wildfire will be eligible for federal funding so they have the resources they need to get the job done. Just recently,  I announced that the U.S. Forest Service has allocated $226,000 to AlertTahoe to install and maintain new fire cameras in the Tahoe basin.
After the Tahoe Summit, I traveled down south and attended the 16th anniversary celebration of the Nevada State Veterans Home in Boulder City, Nevada.
￼ 
At the State Veterans Home celebration. 
I’ve worked for years with the Department of Veterans Affairs to secure federal funding for the State Veterans Home, and I’ll continue to press the agency for adequate resources to complete construction on the Northern Nevada Veterans Home located in Sparks, Nevada. 
￼ 
At the State Veterans Home celebration. 
The next day, I was back in Boulder City with local officials, the Nevada Department of Transportation, the Southern Nevada Regional Transportation Commission, and hundreds of Nevadans at the grand opening ceremony for the Boulder City Bypass, a 15-mile segment of Interstate-11.
￼ 
At the grand opening of I-11 in Boulder City. 
For years, I-11 has been a priority of mine. In 2015, I introduced legislation to extend I-11 from Las Vegas to Northern Nevada, and I secured this extension and designation of I-11 as a high-priority corridor of the National Highway System in the first long-term highway bill in a nearly a decade to be approved by Congress and signed into law.
￼ 
Catching up with Nevadans at the I-11 ceremony. 
On Friday, I was back in Reno and visited Noah’s Animal House, a full-service pet shelter to assist animals from homes experiencing domestic violence.
￼ 
With Staci Alonso, founder of NAH. Staci opened the first NAH shelter in Las Vegas more than a decade ago.  
In both Reno and Las Vegas, Noah’s Animal House is doing incredible work by allowing victims to bring their pets with them to a shelter. This facility empowers survivors and it’s why I’m going to continue to work with my colleagues to pass my PAWS Act into law so domestic abuse victims in Nevada do not have to choose between their pets and their own safety.
As always, it’s an honor to represent you in the U.S. Senate. I have offices in Reno, Las Vegas, and Washington, D.C., and I encourage you to  contact us –  we’re here to help you.

August 12, 2018
Greetings,
This week, I had the pleasure of visiting our brave servicemen and women and Texas military communities during my statewide ‘Texas Defends America’ tour, which included Lackland, Goodfellow and Dyess Air Force Bases and Fort Hood. At these bases, I received updates on training operations and long-term investments that will benefit and improve our military. I am proud to have secured over 30 provisions in FY19 NDAA which benefit Texas and support America’s national security interests at home and abroad. In the challenging environment we live in today, peace through strength is best achieved with a strong, well-funded military. There is no state in the union that loves and values our active duty military and our veterans the way the state of Texas does.
On Wednesday, I participated in a ‘Defend & Reform’ town hall hosted by Concerned Veterans for America (CVA) in San Angelo, where I answered questions from attendees and discussed the issues affecting veterans and their families. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I fight for our military service members and work to ensure that meaningful reform is occurring at the Department of Veterans Affairs to properly support them when they transition to civilian life. That’s why I introduced the V.E.T. Protection Act earlier this year following a January 2017 Government Accountability Office (GAO) Report concerning the abuse of official time practices and union activities by employees at the VA. Each year, VA employees spend over a million hours on union organizing and other activities instead of caring for veterans. That is an enormous amount of time that should be devoted to our veterans. My bill would limit the amount of time VA employees can devote to union activity. The central mission of the VA should be caring for veterans, not spending time on political activities. 
I also visited the Coast Guard Air Station in Houston, where I received an update on Coast Guard operations conducted in South Texas, a briefing on the lessons learned following Hurricane Harvey, and the preparations taking place for the 2018 hurricane season. Hurricane Harvey was unlike anything Texas had ever seen before, and without the help of the brave men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard, many Texans would not have made their way through it. Without hesitation, and despite facing personal loss and property damage to their own homes, the Coast Guardsmen jumped into action and led rescue and recovery efforts. Texas continues to rebuild stronger than ever, and we owe these brave men and women our gratitude. From the floodwaters of hurricanes to the shores of foreign conflict, Texas continues to lead the nation in military readiness and defense.
As we continue to rebuild from the unprecedented devastation from Hurricane Harvey, we must also take all steps necessary to prepare for the hurricane season ahead. For those seeking information or assistance during the recovery and rebuilding process, please do not hesitate to contact my office or use the federal and state resources listed here. For those seeking preparedness information and resources, please refer to the federal and state resources listed here.

That’s why I’m pleased that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced the launch of the Delaware Watershed Conservation Fund (DWCF), a competitive grant and technical assistance program of $4.3 million that will provide new support for the protection, restoration and conservation of fish and wildlife habitats in the Delaware River Watershed, which provides drinking water for more than 15 million people. 
Congress took a momentous step when they established this conservation program, and I am pleased we were able to secure funding to launch restoration and protection grants throughout the river basin. This new grant program allows state and local governments, universities, nonprofit organizations, and other partners to come together to protect our drinking water and tackle increasing problems with flooding. This program will help restore and protect critical habitat for the wildlife and fisheries that make the river and its tributaries a local and national treasure. 
Learn more about this new program HERE. 
  
Fitzpatrick: Most Bipartisan Freshmen Member of Congress
￼ 
I am proud to be recognized as the most bipartisan freshman legislator and third most bipartisan member of the House of Representatives (out of 435 members) for the first session of the 115th Congress according to the Bipartisan Index unveiled by The Lugar Center. 
It’s time for our leaders to come together to tackle the serious challenges facing our nation – from economic growth and national security, to the opioid epidemic and government corruption. Equally as important: we must do so in a civil, dignified manner that is becoming of American values, viewing those with different viewpoints as a strength to be harnessed, not a quality to be criticized.  I’m committed to working with any member of this Congress to break this cycle and make government work for the American people once more.

Dear Friends, 

There's nothing I enjoy more than being in my home state of Arkansas. It's been another busy week here in central Arkansas, talking with advocates, families, and hardworking Arkansans who are making a true impact and difference in our communities. Here are a few highlights from my week in the Natural State. 

Serving and Hearing from Our Homeless Community
￼
I started Monday off serving our homeless community breakfast in Little Rock at the Salvation Army of central Arkansas and Jericho Way. So far this year, my team has conducted 14 visits to eight centers to hear directly from central Arkansans on how we can better assist and best provide services to the homeless. 

Thanking Our Purple Heart Recipients  
￼
Tuesday was Purple Heart Day where we honor members of the Armed Forces who have been wounded or killed. I'm blessed to have Richard Maxwell on my staff who was wounded in combat while serving in Iraq. He received the Purple Heart Medal in February 2005 for his bravery and devotion to our country. Thank you, Richard, and thank you to all our heroes for their service and sacrifice. 

Honoring Staff Sergeant Gilliam
￼
I had the honor and privilege to address the Conway Noon Lions Club on Tuesday where I presented Arkansas Vietnam Veteran, Joseph Gilliam, with two medals. He was awarded the Bronze Star for meritorious service and a Purple Heart for wounds sustained in combat. Thank you Staff Sergeant Gilliam for your service to our country. 

Making Things Happen
￼
I learned that Tendaji is Swahili for ""making things happen."" This is exactly what Saint Mark Baptist Church is doing for elementary and middle school aged students in Little Rock. Through the Tendaji Community Development Corporation (CDC) program, students have a safe, educational, and fun place to go after school. Thank you for loving the youth of Little Rock and for your commitment to help every student reach their full potential. 

Protecting Our Young People From Harm
￼
I am grateful for the Centers for Youth and Family for their sensitive handling of one of society’s most disturbing trends, human trafficking. In Congress, we have passed more than a dozen bills addressing this international and national travesty. I was honored to have a brave young trafficking victim share her story with me and I will use her experiences to help me in the continued fight to protect our young people.

Championing Health for Young Arkansans 
￼
On Wednesday morning, I joined Champions for Health (formerly known as Arkansas Heart Foundation) and Dr. Bruce Murphy as they kicked off their program to fight childhood obesity and give Arkansas youth a brighter, healthier future. I'm a big believer in the idea that individuals should be empowered and encouraged to take responsibility and control of their health. Tremendous thanks to Dr. Murphy and his exceptional team for initiating this comprehensive approach to health education and to Morrilton Intermediate School for being the pilot site for this program.

Caring for The Smallest Among Us   
￼
Thank you Arkansas Children's Hospital for walking me through the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). I was able to see firsthand the world class care that the nurses and staff provide to the smallest among us in central Arkansas.
While in Congress, I was proud to vote for legislation which reauthorized the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for ten years and funded Community Health Centers (CHC). Communities across Arkansas and America depend on programs that help provide access to vital, high-quality health care for our children and ensures that those most vulnerable and most in need of care get the help they need.
Thank you for taking time to keep up with the work I'm doing on your behalf. If I can be any assistance to you or your family, please reach out to my office at (501) 324-5941 or go to my website at hill.house.gov.
Sincerely,
￼ 
Representative French Hill

Backing Our Veterans
 

I believe one of my main commitments in Congress is to take care of our veterans, and ensure they receive the quality care and services they so rightly deserve. This weekend, my office was able to host a VA Claims Clinic and Information Day, which allowed south Mississippi veterans immediate access to Jackson VA Regional Office representatives, access to over 32 veteran resource vendors, and many helpful veterans resources. 

I'd like to thank everyone who came out and helped make this such a successful and meaningful event. Please continue to monitor my social media accounts for future veterans events similar to this. If you are a veteran or know a veteran that needs assistance, please contact my office. 

￼

As a Marine veteran of the Persian Gulf War and a member of the Mississippi National Guard, I know the sacrifice and commitment members of our military make to keep our nation safe. Anything less than the best for them is unacceptable, and I remain committed to keeping our promises to these brave men and women. 

Since day one I have been fighting for our veterans in Congress by passing bills that reform the VA, increase funding for veterans' health care, expand mental health services for veterans, and fund programs that will assist veterans in finding jobs within the private sector. I’ve worked alongside President Trump over the past two years to improve efficiency, transparency, and services available to America's veterans.

In the 115th Congress we've passed the VA MISSION Act into law, which implements major reforms and improvements to the Department of Veterans Affairs. This included consolidating community care programs into one single program, funding for the Veterans Choice Program, expanding eligibility for the Family Caregivers Program, and strengthening the VA's ability to recruit and retain the best health care professionals. 

For too long our veterans have suffered under the bureaucracy of the VA. Some have literally died while waiting in line for care, and no one was held accountable. Our veterans deserve better service and greater transparency within the VA. Despite the many scandals that have run rampant through the VA and hospitals around the country, the VA leadership has had little ability to remove underperforming employees. That's why we passed the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act which allows the VA to fire bad employees that were previously protected. Since this bill was passed, the VA's established the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection, which has resulted in over 3,200 removals, suspensions, and demotions at the VA. 

Below are several other pro-veteran bills that I have cosponsored this congress, 3 of which have been signed by the President. 

H.R. 3218: Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 signed into law 
H.R. 2519: The American Legion 100th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act signed into law 
H.R. 873: Global War on Terrorism War Memorial Act signed into law
H.R. 299: Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2017 
H.R. 512: WINGMAN Act 
H.R. 2327: PAWS Act of 2017 
H.R. 846: Military Surviving Spouses Equity Act 
 
1108th Meritorious Unit Commendation
From September 2011 to August 2012 the 1108th Aviation Group, in support of New Dawn in Iraq and Operation Enduring Freedom in Kuwait and Afghanistan, displayed their expertise and extraordinary skills that contributed to the success of multiple highly visible military operations. This unit was able to deploy on schedule and establish operations in three different countries, and was responsible for processing 6,131 aviation orders that resulted in $53.9 million dollars in savings for the Army Working Capital Fund, repairing 219 rotary wing assets, and recovering $30.7 million of aviation and missile components. I'm thankful I was able to join several other military officials in recognizing the 1108th for their outstanding performance and for serving our country so well.

NEWS FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT
Dear Friend,

We had a busy week traveling across the Second District, meeting with local leaders and law enforcement, veterans, health care professionals, and even some honey bees. Please read about my week below: 

￼ 

On Monday, I met with Franklin County Sheriff A.J. Smith and Alan Pierce. We visited the areas devastated by the Eastpoint fire in June and spoke with local residents. 

￼ 

I then headed to Lynn's Oysters in Eastpoint and met with Franklin County Commissioners,the City Planner, and local residents to discuss the breakwater issue. I heard how everyone is affected by the breakwater and learned about its importance to the area. We discussed ways Congress can help the local community. 

￼ 
Later in the day, I stopped in Gulf County and met with the Port St. Joe City Commissioners. They expressed frustration with government red tape and it's effect on economic development. I have been working hard to cut red tape to make it easier for local communities to expand and thrive. 

￼ 
On Wednesday, I met with the regional eastern manager of Barkman Apiaries, Al Bryant and learned about how important bees are to the agriculture industry. Barkman Honey has been around since World War II, but the Barkman Apiaries in Blountstown opened 3 years ago and has 17-18 beekeepers. They walked me through the process of how they produce and distribute honey. They also talked about issues they have transporting bees under current laws and what Congress can do to help.

￼ 
We had a great lunch at Apalachee Restaurant in Liberty County and met with local leaders, business owners, and school board members. We discussed forestry issues in the area, the Farm Bill, and ways to improve economic development. We also toured the Liberty County courthouse with Robert Hill and Tim Revell. 

Oversight For Our Veterans
￼ 
On Friday, Congressmen Ted Yoho (FL-03) and John Rutherford (FL-04) joined me in conducting oversight visits of the Malcom Randall VAMC and the Lake City VAMC - the two VA hospitals which are a part of the North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System. We met with clinicians, administrators, and several patients of the nearly 7,000 that the local health system treats daily. We must remain committed to oversight, and believe me, this is not an easy task. I hear from veterans every day who face unnecessary roadblocks because of bureaucracy at the VA. We are working to fix this and visiting the clinics where our veterans receive care is an important piece of this effort.

Thank you for your continued energy and enthusiasm, as reflected in your letters and Facebook posts. If you haven’t already, LIKE my Facebook page. You can also follow me on Twitter @DrNealDunnFL2.
Thank you for the opportunity to serve you in Congress!
 Sincerely,  ￼  Dr. Neal Dunn Member of Congress

HIGHLIGHTS

Our August Community Hero of the Month: Vanessa Ornelas of Asheboro
Vanessa epitomizes the mission of the YMCA, influencing countless lives in Randolph County. Walking around the YMCA garden and through the halls of facility, you could see the impact Vanessa has on its patrons.

Celbrating Purple Heart Day and the Sacrifices of Our Heroes
On August 7, 1782, our nation’s future first president established the Badge of Military Merit – a heart-shaped purple cloth military decoration to recognize soldiers who selflessly made sacrifices to advance our cause of freedom. 236 years later, we call this sacred military medal the Purple Heart, the ultimate symbol of the patriotism and bravery shown by our finest men and women.
One of my greatest honors in Congress is helping secure outstanding medals for our WWII, Korean War, and Vietnam War veterans. While we can never say thank you enough, the Purple Heart is a representation of our nation’s everlasting appreciation and indebtedness to our heroes.

The Central Asheboro Boys & Girls Club offers an invaluable service to our youth, giving them a friend and a place of comfort as they face the challenges of life. Their work with our youth is an inspiring representation of three issues that I am fervently passionate about – criminal justice reform, supporting the work of our local charities and creating opportunities for our next generation. I am proud to have led efforts on each of these fronts in Congress, yielding real, tangible results for the children and families of our community. I look forward to continuing our work supporting the Boys & Girls Club and all the great organizations that serve North Carolina.

Congressman McHenry Weekly Update 


Back Home in the Tenth District



Last week our nation celebrated Purple Heart Day and it was a true honor to be a part of a moving ceremony that the local chapter of the Military Order of the Purple Heart and Pack Brothers Collision Center in Belmont did to honor local veteran Kirk Davis. Mr. Davis has overcome a series of adversities and through it all has kept his focus on helping others. He was selected as the recipient of a donated a completely refurbished car. 

￼

On Monday, I enjoyed speaking to the Montcross Chamber's Board of Directors as well as elected officials from eastern Gaston County. It was a great dialogue about the latest developments in Washington, specifically the benefits that Opportunity Zones can have for Gaston County.

￼

I began Tuesday with a tour of the manufacturing operation at Celanese's plant in Grover. They make polymers that are in products we use everyday but probably never realize it.    

￼

At lunchtime I attended the Cleveland Chamber's annual Congressional Luncheon where business, civic, and elected leaders from Cleveland County were in attendance to hear the latest from Washington.

￼

In the afternoon I had a meeting with members of the Still Standing Foundation. These are all local law enforcement and former law enforcement who were wounded in the line of duty. They have established the Still Standing Foundation to help assist others in the same situation deal with obstacles they face after a line of duty injury.

￼

There was no better stop for an afternoon snack than Scoop Ice Cream in Rutherfordton. Scoop Ice Cream already has a successful store in Lake Lure and it was great to see them open a second location.

￼

Wednesday morning I attended the annual breakfast with residents of Lake Lure to provide a quick update on what is happening in Washington. Thank you to Mayor Kevin Cooley for hosting this breakfast.

        ￼

My next stop was a tour of a small business started in Spindale. Blue Ridge Armor designs, engineers and manufactures bullet resistant armor and personal protective equipment for law enforcement agencies.

￼

It was an honor to present a USDA Rural Development Loan to Rutherford Electric Membership Corporation. This Rural Development investment will be used to build 112 miles of electric transmission line and make other system improvements to serve Western North Carolina.

￼

Wednesday afternoon I toured Abercrombie Textiles in Cliffside, NC. Abercrombie manufactures dobby and jacquard fabrics for a variety of applications, including upholstery, bedding, wallcovering and drapery.

￼

My last stop on Wednesday was to participate in the National Association of Convenience Stores ""In Store"" Program at the Quik Trip in Gastonia. Thanks to all of the store associates who took the time to have me as a trainee.

￼

On Thursday morning I met with the staff and providers at Catawba Family Care Services to learn more about the important service they provide to Catawba County and western North Carolina.

￼

I greatly appreciate the Catawba County Chamber of Commerce, in conjunction with the US Chamber of Commerce, for hosting me. The turnout was great, and I enjoyed the dialogue with those in attendance. I was honored to to be presented with the US Chamber's Spirit of Enterprise Award.

￼

I ended my week in the district by hearing from a group in recovery from opioid and substance use disorder. What was shared was moving, and will inform me as our nation works to confront this issue. Thank you to Dr. Corey Richardson and Project Lazarus for facilitating this meeting.

￼

Hearing From You


Over the past two weeks I have held six town hall meetings all over the Tenth District. I am thankful for everyone who came out and shared their questions and concerns with my staff and me. I began my second week of town halls in Gaston County where I was humbled to present flags flown over the US Capitol in honor of Gaston County Sheriff's Office Corporal Katelyn Self and Caromont Health Emergency Department Supervisory Nurse Amanda Self. Both women died in a tragic incident recently and it was an honor to do something to recognize their service to the community.

￼

On Tuesday, my first town hall was in Shelby where I had a great discussion with residents of Cleveland County and the surrounding areas. You can learn more about the Shelby town hall by clicking here for an article from the Shelby Star.

￼

I then headed to Rutherford County where I enjoyed another productive discussion on the issues that matter the most to the Tenth District constituents who attended.

What I Have Been Reading



Fallen family members honored by congressman in Gaston County

WBTV 

I was honored to present two flags flown over the U.S. Capitol in recognition of Katelyn Self and Amanda Self. My prayers remain with the Gaston County Sheriff’s Office and the entire Gaston County law enforcement community as they mourn the loss of Corporal Katelyn Self. Please join me in keeping all those impacted by this tragedy in our prayers as they recover. Learn more by reading this article from the Gaston Gazette as well.


U.S. small business owners' optimism at a record high

Gallup 

Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, which is why it is such great news to hear that owners of small businesses all across America are more optimistic than ever. The Tenth District is no exception to this good news. This past week I had the opportunity to visit several small businesses here in western North Carolina, including the ribbon cutting of a new business just opening.

Dear Friend, 
I wanted to take a few minutes to give a brief update on the current state of the Farm Bill and provisions we are working on including in the final piece of legislation. 
It is certainly no secret to anyone that works in the fields for a living that rural America is hurting. Farm income has fallen 52 percent since 2013, one of the steepest drops since the Great Depression. Costs of production have steadily climbed, while commodity prices have fallen. Trade disputes and the dumping of commodities like those from Mexico are hurting our producers. The Digital Divide caused by inadequate or a lack of broadband service has held back innovation, job growth and education in rural America. Crises like the opioid epidemic have stricken communities across America.
I truly believe that this Farm Bill we are working on in Congress addresses all of these challenges and has the potential to bring new innovation and investment back into rural America. 
As negotiations continue, I will prioritize maintaining the current commodity policy provisions for peanut producers and the commodity policy for seed cotton, reauthorizing the Rural Utility Service Loans and Broadband grants, and bolstering research and the development of additional risk management policies for specialty crops like peaches and pecans.
This farm bill is our opportunity to provide the needed certainty and support to our farmers and producers, while also providing commonsense reforms that will support the President’s agenda of achieving prosperity in our rural communities. 
Passing a strong farm bill on time is the key to this goal. We are close, but there is still much work to be done.

HONORING OUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERS FROM SOUTH GEORGIA
This past week, I had the opportunity to visit the Jack Hadley Black History Museum in Thomasville to learn more about local African-American leaders. Among those leaders is Lt. Henry Flipper, the Thomasville native who was the first black graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. 
The Jack Hadley Black History Museum is an important component of the South Georgia community, and I thank Mr. Jack Hadley for the tour and the chance to learn more about the rich history of South Georgia.

GA CHAMBER TOUR EXAMINES GROWTH IN MIDDLE GEORGIA 
On Wednesday this past week, I had the opportunity to attend a GA Chamber meeting and meet with local leaders in the Warner Robins area to examine growth in the region and see new ways we can bring jobs and economic opportunities to Middle Georgia. 
After years of struggling to get ahead, Georgians are seeing jobs, opportunity, and confidence coming back. Following historic tax reform, unemployment is at historic lows, job openings are at record highs, paychecks are growing, and wages are rising, right along with economic optimism. Families in Georgia are also taking home more of their hard-earned pay than before, with the average tax cut for a typical family of four coming in at just over $2,000.
While the last couple years have been very productive, certainly much more work remains. But our economy is growing, and Republican policies are helping to improve the lives of Georgians and making it easier for families to get ahead, with a renewed sense of confidence for the future.
As we continue to work on policies that grow our local economies and provide more opportunities for small businesses and rural communities, I want to stay in touch on ideas you may have. Please do not hesitate to reach out to any of my offices or send me an email if there are avenues you see where we can ease burdens on businesses and create an even friendlier business environment in Georgia.

MEETING WITH PEANUT SHELLERS 
I also had the opportunity to attend the Peanut Shellers Association Pre-Harvest Meeting in Cordele this past week. During the meeting, I gave a brief update on the Farm Bill and policy provisions that impact peanut growers and the Eighth District as a whole.
I am looking forward to seeing this year’s crop, and I thank them for the chance to hear their concerns and ideas on farm policy and what we in Washington can do to better aid our producers.

Friends,
 
This year, we have seen a booming economy due to Congress rolling back job-killing regulations, our historic tax cut, and hard working Americans. By lowering taxes across the board and simplifying our tax system, the law has already started to deliver more jobs, bigger paychecks, and economic growth for all Americans. Close to 4 million workers across the United States received a bonus from their employers, unemployment is at 3.9%, and wages are up. I have visited several businesses in our district that announced they are expanding their operations and hiring more employees because of the tax cuts.
 
In addition, over 87 million people have seen a lower utility bill, over 1 million jobs have been created this year alone and our economic growth for this year’s second quarter was 4.1%. 
 
Tax reform is working and I am excited to see our economy boom and families have more money in your pocket.
 
In order to keep this momentum going, I believe we must encourage debate and thoughtful dialogue between community leaders, small business owners, workers and elected officials. By doing so, we can ensure that we are acting in the best interests of the people. Ever since I came to Washington, I have prided myself on my ability to work across the aisle to find bipartisan solutions to the problems facing our country. That’s why I’m proud to host the bipartisan, bicameral North Carolina Business and Economic Development Summit on September 13th and 14th in Washington, D.C. in conjunction with North Carolina’s Members of Congress. We are hosting this event as an opportunity for all North Carolinians to meet with federal government officials to discuss how we can best implement policies that positively affect workers in our state. 
 
Home to nearly 900,000 small businesses employing almost 1.7 million people, North Carolina plays a crucial role in our nation’s economy. In order to ensure these industries and small businesses can continue to drive our economy, we must afford them every opportunity to prosper and grow.
 
This two-day bipartisan event gives small business owners and workers the venue to network and discuss shared legislative and business concerns. In past years, attendees heard from special guests, including state leaders, officials from the Administration and Capitol Hill, as well as members of the media.
 
I look forward to continuing this important conversation with folks from our district this year at the North Carolina Business and Economic Development Summit. Please join me and my colleagues, U.S. Representatives G.K. Butterfield, George Holding, Walter Jones, David Price, Virginia Foxx, Mark Walker, David Rouzer, Robert Pittenger, Patrick McHenry, Mark Meadows, Alma Adams, Ted Budd, and U.S. Senators Richard Burr and Thom Tillis for this important event on Thursday, September 13th and Friday, September 14th in Washington, D.C.
 
For more information and to register for the event, please visit https://hudson.house.gov/nc-business-and-economic-development-summit/ or call my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-3715.
 
This will be the 21st annual bipartisan summit, and we are working for it to be the most productive one yet!
 
 
Until next week,
￼
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress (NC-08)

Rebuilding our Military 
 
For many years, we have asked our military to do more with less. Republicans are changing that. Specifically, we are ensuring our military is better trained, equipped, and supported by:
Bolstering military size and strength. Our military is adding 20,000 troops to ensure the strength of armed forces as we combat terrorist organizations as well as potential nuclear threats like North Korea and Iran.   Investing in the tools needed to keep our troops safe, well-trained, and effective. After years of our military readiness suffering under reduced spending and cuts, we are investing in the tools to be fully manned and properly equipped. This includes improving missile defense capabilities, upgrading combat vehicles, purchasing new Joint Strike Fighter aircraft and investing in new submarines.   Providing Better Care to our Veterans. The VA MISSION Act was signed into law by President Trump. This legislation consolidated the VA’s multiple community care programs and authorities and provides further funding to sustain the Choice Program so veterans can get the care they earned and deserve.  Giving men and women in uniform their largest pay increase since 2010. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2018 provided a 2.4 percent pay raise. This well-deserved pay raise is the largest raise in eight years and is an important way to show our thanks. That means that over 30,000 active-duty military personnel in South Carolina will get their first pay raise in over a decade!

Beachfront Renourishment 
 
 
Beachfront renourishment is critical for our economy, our environment, and our quality of life in the Seventh District. Over the past few years, my office worked hard to secure the funding necessary to complete the Myrtle Beach Restoration Project and ensure the prosperity of our beautiful beaches! As you may have heard, the Army Corps of Engineers recently announced the construction schedule for beachfront renourishment projects along the Grand Strand, which can be found on my website. You can learn more about upcoming beachfront renourishment construction projects and what they mean to our coastal community by watching the below video!

ICYMI: I-73 Update 
 
 
America is the land of opportunity and infrastructure helps build a pathway to that opportunity. Investing in infrastructure creates jobs, benefits our economy, increases safety, and improves our communities- which is exactly why building I-73 has been one of my top priorities in Congress. I recently spoke to The Sun News about my work to bring I-73 to fruition and create opportunity in some of the poorest counties in South Carolina. I-73 will build off of the success of the Dillon Inland Port, attracting diversified industry and new jobs to the Pee Dee and the Grand Strand. While obstructionist groups are working to prevent opportunities from coming to overlooked areas in our state, I will keep fighting until people are driving on I-73!

Tax Facts: Workers are Winning
 
 
After years of struggling to get ahead, Americans across the country are benefiting from our booming economy... and the numbers prove it! Despite some of the rhetoric you may have heard, here are just a few facts about how tax reform is directly improving the lives of America's workers and families:   Businesses are creating jobs. Over 1.5 million jobs have been created since tax reform was signed into law, and job growth has averaged 224,000 over the past three months.  Wages are rising. Compensation for workers rose to a nearly 10-year high in the second quarter. The employment cost index, which reflects changes in employee wages and benefits, rose at the fastest pace in ten years.  
People without high school diplomas are going to work. The unemployment rate for those without a high school diploma fell to 5.1 percent in July, a dramatic turn for when the unemployment rate for this group was 15.6 percent in 2009.   Stores and factories are hiring at an unprecedented rate. Stores and factories are leading this year's hiring boom. Retailers have added an average of 12,000 workers a month in 2018. Additionally, the US. has added 327,000 manufacturing jobs over the past year, including 37,000 jobs added in July alone.   This is just a small snapshot of how American workers are benefiting from our growing economy! We will keep working to restore opportunities for all Americans. 
 

Have a great week,
￼

Tom Rice

Traveling the State to Hear From You
 
This week, I hosted a number of roundtables across the state to listen to local leaders about the issues facing their communities. Given Pennsylvania's diverse nature, the topics discussed varied from the opioid epidemic to ensuring rural communities have reliable broadband.
In Harrisburg, a number of business leaders shared concerns about the administration's trade policy. Their worries were echoed during a roundtable I hosted in Mercer County, during which some local employers told me increased costs from these ill-advised tariffs might force them to lay off workers.
During a roundtable in Forest County, the county commissioners and other local leaders, including Amanda Hetrick, Forest Area School District Superintendent, spoke about the need for reliable broadband and health care providers in the area.
Shifting focus to issues facing law enforcement, I joined Scott Brady, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, Shawn White, Venango County District Attorney, and a number of police officers in Venango County. During our discussion they told me that departments are stretched thin by the opioid epidemic.
These forums are extremely helpful. Hearing from local leaders about issues unique to their communities greatly helps to inform my overall approach in Washington. I appreciated the constructive dialogue and look forward to hosting more events like these in the future.  
￼
￼
Continued Success of Tax Reform
Tax reform was designed to make it more affordable for businesses to buy new equipment and that is exactly what I saw when I visited Ellwood Group Inc. in Warren County this week. The company's National Forge in Irvine is installing new state-of-the-art machinery, an investment that the company's leadership said was only possible because of tax reform. The purchase will expand the productive capacity of the company and ultimately lead to more job opportunities for local residents. This type of investment is exactly what we hoped for when we wrote the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Ellwood Group Inc. is an important company to Northwestern Pennsylvania, so I appreciated the opportunity to visit. Tax reform is working all across Pennsylvania and across the country. It is why we have strong economic growth and record low unemployment.
Read more about my visit in the Times-Observer.
￼
￼
Meeting with Local Reporters
While in Berks County this week, I stopped by to speak to the reporters at the Reading Eagle. We had a great conversation about a wide-ranging set of issues from Judge Brett Kavanaugh to immigration policy. Having just toured the Berks Co. Residential Center, I shared my view that more high-quality facilities are needed nationally to temporarily house families who are seeking asylum.
Later in the week, I stopped by the Republican Herald in Schuylkill County to again talk with local reporters about the issues facing our country.
I appreciated the chance to meet with local reporters and editors to update them on what has been an extremely productive Congress. Since January 2017, the Senate has confirmed Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and 24 individuals to circuit court judgeships, repealed the individual mandate, passed tax reform, and rolled back onerous regulations. There is much more work to be done, but I am pleased with what lawmakers have accomplished thus far.

August 12, 2018   Dear  @gmail.com,  We live in dangerous, unpredictable times. The threats we face are not just the terror networks and plots we've been disrupting for more than a decade, but also major powers like Russia, China, and North Korea who wield a range of nuclear, conventional, and cyber weapons.   To ensure our military remains the greatest fighting force in the history of the world, I've been proud to support legislation this Congress to add 20,000 troops, give them a 2.6 percent pay raise (the largest in nine years), and invest in our missile defense capabilities, combat vehicles, as well as new aircraft (including F/A-18s built in St. Louis) and submarines. 
You can learn more about what Congress has done to rebuild our military at armedservices.house.gov/ndaa. 
Providing the resources and training our troops need doesn't end when they leave active duty. And it's no exaggeration to say that this Congress and this president have enacted the most sweeping reforms to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in a generation.   Major VA reforms signed into law this Congress include:  
	•	The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which created a streamlined and efficient process to remove, demote or suspend any VA employee for poor performance or misconduct.
	•	The VA MISSION Act, which consolidated the VA’s multiple community care programs and authorities and provides further funding to sustain the Choice Program so veterans can get the care they earned and deserve.
	•	The Forever GI Bill, which removed restrictions so eligible veterans can use their education benefits throughout their lives, instead of the current 15-year deadline.
Our military and our veterans are better off now because of these bipartisan bills I supported and that President Trump signed into law. Veterans, or any constituents, having issues with the VA or any federal government agency are always welcome to contact my office for assistance.  
I also regularly sends a veteran-specific newsletter with information and updates. You can sign up for those emails at shimkus.house.gov.

Friends,
Great Lakes Protection This is not a red or blue issue. Protecting and preserving the Great Lakes is a priority of mine. The lakes form the largest fresh surface water system on Earth and provide drinking water for more than 48 million people. The lakes generate more than 1.5 million jobs and $60 billion in wages annually. I will continue to champion full funding to restore the lakes through the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative in Congress. Check out this editorial about our efforts to maintain funding so far.
Our Booming Economy It is encouraging to know that the economy is continuing its upswing. The new jobs report for July came out last week showing the U.S. added a total of 157,000 new jobs, the average hourly earnings rate increased by 2.7 percent from last year, and the unemployment rate fell to 3.9%. This is all great news for business owners, those looking for work, and our local economies. Check out this graphic below from the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee. ￼
Meeting with Local Elected Officials  Last Friday, I had the opportunity to speak with the mayors of Twinsburg, Aurora, Boston Heights & others at the annual Mayors Association of Portage, Stark & Summit meeting at the new Gleneagles Clubhouse in Twinsburg! I enjoy working with local elected officials to benefit our communities. ￼
District Tour with The Ohio State University President Michael V. Drake On Friday, Ohio State President Michael Drake and I took to the road to tour Northeast Ohio. We talked about the great work being done for our waterways through the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which I helped guarantee full funding for, and the growing need for trained, educated farmers and landscape specialists to keep this industry thriving in our community. We traveled to the new Scenic Waterway Designation Area in Rock Creek, Patterson Farms in Chesterland, and the Ridge Manor Nursery in Madison.  ￼
Greater CLE Coordinated Response to Human Trafficking The sad truth is human trafficking has become more and more of an issue in our neighborhoods. Congress has passed many bills, like the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, which allows state attorneys and victims to sue websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking, like Backpage.com. This week, my office participated in the Greater Cleveland Coordinated Response to Human Trafficking meeting along with both of Ohio's U.S. Senators and Ohio Attorney General, Mike DeWine. Discussions centered around making greater efforts to combat this issue through legislation and law enforcement. As the co-Chair of the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence, this is one of many issues that I will continue to work on to stop innocent people from being victimized. ￼
Business Leader Tariff Roundtable On Monday morning, I participated in a tariff roundtable with local Geauga County businesses at Bonitas International in Newbury Township. Thank you, Geauga Growth Partnership, Inc. for setting up this productive discussion. I will always put American workers and businesses first! ￼
Purple Heart Day On Tuesday, we honored the brave men and women who risked their lives on behalf of our freedom, including my father, who was a WWII Purple Heart recipient. Thanks for your service. ￼
TwinsDay in Twinsburg Every year since 1976, twins from around the world file in two-by-two to Twinsburg for the Twins Days Festival, the world's largest annual gathering of twins. This year was no different from the many years before as twins, triplets, and others traveled to Northeast Ohio for a weekend of double the fun. I hope everyone who was able to attend these events had a great time! If you missed it, be sure to check it out next year.  ￼

THE BOST BULLETIN
Friend: 
There’s been plenty of activity in both Southern Illinois and Washington, DC recently, including delivering “Meals on Wheels” and visiting small businesses in Alton, stopping by the Marion Fire Department, honoring a local first responder from Pinckneyville, and convening my opioid task force. So I’d like to highlight a few items that may be of interest to you.

Hearing From You 
Last week, I asked you what issues Congress should focus on in the remainder of this legislative session. Below are the results. Thank you to all who participated! 
￼

Convening My Opioid Task Force in O'Fallon 
￼ 
On Tuesday, I hosted members of my opioid task force at my O’Fallon Office to discuss local efforts to fight the opioid epidemic ravaging our communities. 
As a father and grandfather, it’s gut-wrenching to hear stories of personal tragedy and loss due to opioids. But these aren’t isolated incidents. There were almost 2,000 opioid overdose fatalities in Illinois in 2016. That’s nearly twice the number of deaths from car accidents. These are moms and dads, sons and daughters, neighbors and friends. 
I provided an update on legislative efforts in Congress and received feedback from law enforcement, recovery treatment experts, and representatives from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.  

Delivering ""Meals on Wheels"" in Alton 
￼ 
I drove around Alton with Cornelius delivering meals through the Meals on Wheels program, which is administered by Senior Services Plus. This vitally important program serves meals to roughly 420 customers.

Checking in With the Marion Fire Department 
￼ 
I stopped by the Marion Fire Department on Wednesday to say thanks for serving our community. As a former union firefighter, I know the challenges our first responders face every day and how far a simple ""thank you"" can go.

Praying For Our Nation 
￼ 
Tracy and I sat down with the Christian Broadcasting Network to talk about the role of faith in Congress and how you can send prayers to the White House. My faith supports me every day I serve in Congress. 

Visiting Abbott Machine Company in Alton 
￼
Thanks to Bob Abbott and Mike St. Peters for showing me around Abbott Machine Company in Alton. Abbott specializes in the rebuilding, re-manufacturing, retrofitting and servicing of quality boring mills and cylindrical roll grinders. They refurbish used equipment at fraction of the cost for smaller businesses, providing good-paying, quality jobs.

Paying a Visit to Young Entrepreneurs in Carterville 
￼ 
Great chatting with two young entrepreneurs at Crown Brew Coffee Co. in Carterville. These guys are truly passionate about coffee. I'll continue supporting an agenda in Washington to reduces Washington over-regulation, supports local job creators, and helps small businesses like this one get on their feet.

Recognizing a Local Hero from Pinckneyville  
￼ 
I recognized Officer James Holder of the Pinckneyville Police Department on the House floor for receiving the Illinois State Bar Association’s Law Enforcement Award. Thank you, Officer Holder, for your brave service. 
That’s an update on what I’ve been doing. I hope you have a great week ahead!
  
Mike

Tenney Kicks Off Second Week of Renew NY-22 with Rebuilding Our Communities Week
Since 1929, CABVI has helped the blind and visually impaired throughout the city of Utica achieve their highest levels of independence. On Monday, I kicked off Rebuilding our Communities Week by visiting the Central Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired (CABVI). CABVI provides comprehensive vision rehabilitation, employment and technology services personally tailored to meet the needs of the blind and visually impaired.  
Through this important work and mission, the team at CABVI has touched the lives of many while supporting families throughout our community. When my father was going blind, CABVI assisted our family to ensure he could live an independent life. Rebuilding our communities starts with supporting local agencies, like CABVI, that provide services for our vulnerable populations. In Congress, I’ll continue to advocate for policies that ensure agencies like CABVI can continue to give back to the community.
I have always been a fierce advocate for programs that provide services for our elderly and those with disabilities. Through this work, I won the AbilityOne Champion award for my advocacy and support of the AbilityOne program which employs more than 45,000 people with disabilities. I also signed onto a Resolution to express Congress’ intent to protect and strengthen Medicare and Social Security. When President Trump proposed cuts to the Legal Services, Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), 21st Century Community Learning Program, Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONCDP) and the Rural Economic Development Program, I stood up to him.
￼ 
Rebuilding our Communities starts with providing funding to proven programs that help those who are truly needy. From Community Action Agencies to Rehabilitation Facilities, I have championed programs that provide targeted assistance to programs with the mission to give our vulnerable a hand up. On Tuesday, I toured the Utica Public Library’s new children’s reading room as part of the Rebuilding our Communities Week. Utica Public Library provides quality resources and services to stimulate creativity and intellectual curiosity that facilitates lifelong learning skills for our community.  
The Utica Public Library’s new children’s reading room provides the resources that empower young people to nurture the habit of reading as well as providing them with important technological resources they may not have at home. As a lifelong library card holder, I understand the importance of ensuring our public libraries receive adequate funding so they can continue to give back to our community. 
￼  
Kids Oneida is a non-profit organization that works with at-risk youth and their families enabling them to live a productive and healthy lifestyle. On Wednesday, I toured Evelyn’s House run by Kids Oneida. 
Through Kids Oneida, Evelyn’s House was founded as a safe and nurturing home, offering supportive services for young mothers and their children. It was great to tour the house and meet with the Director and partners of the program to learn firsthand how they empower the most vulnerable in our community with the tools for a lifetime of success.  In Congress, I will continue to champion programs that provide targeted assistance to give our vulnerable a hand up.
In 2014, Evelyn’s House supported 16 young women and 17 children in the home, with 11 transitioning to permanent housing, 2 enrolling in GED programs, 5 attending or graduating from high school, and 6 securing daycare.  
￼
There are few jobs more perilous than that of a firefighter, and their service deserves to be recognized at every turn. On Friday, I stopped by the Utica Fire Department's Station 7 to see firsthand the work they do every day to protect and serve our community. These brave men and women are heroes who give a part of themselves, sometime their lives, to save others.
In Congress, I have always fought for our first responders. I was an original cosponsor of H.R. 931, the Firefighter Cancer Registry Act. This measure establishes a registry though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to collect information and develop a database on cancer incidences among firefighters.

Babin Introduces Legislation to Keep Communities Safe
Whether it’s a shooting, stabbing, bombing, or other example of predatory violence, mass causality events are occurring far too often. Americans want a solution, which is why I introduced the Threat Assessment, Prevention, and Safety (TAPS) Act (H.R. 6664) last week. The TAPS Act goes beyond political rhetoric to provide a national strategy to keep our communities safe from targeted violence.   For decades, federal agencies have been using a process to identify, investigate, assess, and mitigate threats as a way to counter targeted violence. Pioneered by the U.S. Secret Service, threat assessment and management has proven successful in protecting our presidents and foreign dignitaries. If this process works to protect the president, elected officials, foreign dignitaries, and even celebrities, why aren’t we using it to protect our children and local communities?  The TAPS Act will do just that by creating a national strategy that will enable federal, state, and local entities to work together to implement the threat assessment and management process in order to prevent targeted violence in communities and schools.   For more information on the TAPS Act, please click here. 
Helping Local Veterans
￼
 It was an honor to meet this week with Jasper County Sheriff Mitchel Newman, local law enforcement, veterans, and first responders. This was a follow-up to the  ‘Veterans in Crisis’ workshop that my office hosted with local law enforcement in March, where we connected these folks with the Michael DeBakey Veterans Hospital in Houston to create protocols for assisting with veterans in crisis situations. Our gathering this week discussed the new procedures that came as a result of our workshop, as well as other ways we can work together to provide our veterans with the care that they need. 
Prayer and Discussion with Local Pastors 
￼
During my visits to TX-36, I like to meet with local pastors to pray for our country and communities. Last week, I had the privilege of joining this group of pastors in Livingston for a time of discussion and prayer over important issues, including protecting the unborn, upholding religious liberty, ending human trafficking, and keeping our communities safe.

 JSC Leading in Human Space Exploration
￼
America is on the verge of once again launching American astronauts, from American soil, back into orbit aboard American spacecraft. I had a great day at NASA Johnson Space Center  recently as they announced the crews who will be flying aboard our commercial crew systems to the International Space Station.  
Visiting  with Constituents
￼
I always enjoy visiting with the good folks of TX-36, and had a great time joining some of them for coffee in Woodville this week. We are working hard in Washington to keep moving our country in the right direction, and I’m happy I was able to share an update with everyone.  

￼
Last week, I met with employees at Huntsman Corporation to hear about issues affecting them. I was also able to talk about the benefits of tax reform, cutting regulations, and legislation I’ve introduced to help support open competition for state and local municipalities in infrastructure projects.Thanks to Huntsman for having me!

From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:
Good Afternoon,
This week, I had the honor of presenting Staff Sergeant Craig Trunzo with the Global War on Terrorism medal as well as the Korean Defense Service medal for his distinguished service in the U.S. Airforce.
￼
Honoring our Veterans 
While attending this ceremony at the VA Medical Center near Wilkes-Barre, I was reminded how fortunate we are to have men and women willing to serve and defend our country. Our nation would be a much different place without the sacrifices that our veterans and their families make. Thank you to Staff Sergeant Trunzo for his service and to the VA staff who support our nation’s heroes.  
Promoting Responsible Practices in Land and Water Conservation
I had the pleasure of meeting with Michael Eckly, William Kunze, and Ronald Ramsey from Nature Conservancy to discuss Pennsylvania’s ongoing conservation efforts.
￼
We had an informative discussion regarding the Land and Water Conservation Fund and  the Working Woodlands program that will help promote long term responsible conservation practices.  I learned that the Working Woodlands program is helping to preserve 50,000 acres right here in Pennsylvania.
Recognizing 60 Years of Public Service
For six decades, Bill Miller served as a volunteer firefighter for Loyalsock Township.
￼
As the son of a firefighter, I’m deeply appreciative of Mr. Miller’s steadfast commitment to putting his community before himself. It was a privilege to meet Bill and honor him for a lifetime of service. Thank you for your tirelessly effort to keep our local communities safe and letting me be part of this special night.
Supporting our Entrepreneurs 
As our economy continues to strengthen, I am proud to see this growth translate into real opportunities for local business owners in our district.
￼
Highlighting a local entrepreneur, it was a pleasure to sit down with Diana DeVaughn, owner of Fairy Baldmother’s Wig Boutique in Williamsport and the Small Business Development Center’s Brenda Holdren.  I was impressed with Diana’s plans for her business and how she intends to grow in the future. It is because of self-starters like Diana, and the resources provided by the SBDC, that will sustain Pennsylvania’s economy for years to come.
New Dairy Insurance Plan Available Nationwide
On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Risk Management Agency announced a new insurance plan aimed to protect dairy farmers from unexpected declines in quarterly milk sales. This plan, called Dairy Revenue Protection, provides insurance for fluctuating milk prices, a greater choice of prices, and ranging coverage levels, from 70 to 95 percent of revenue. Participating producers are not precluded from participation in the USDA Farm Service Agency’s Margin Protection Plan (MPP). Those interested in purchasing Dairy Revenue Protection must do so through an agent selling on behalf of an approved insurance provider. Visit https://www.rma.usda.gov/tools/agent.html for more information.
As Always…
Please never hesitate to contact me at my offices in the district or in Washington, D.C.  I want to hear from you and learn what is most important to serve you in the best possible way.

August 12, 2018
Dear Friend,  
Last week was extremely busy, as I had the privilege of meeting with several groups of constituents, participating in events around the community, following up on legislative priorities and working on a variety of concerns that my constituents have with federal agencies.  It is important to me to visit with as many people as possible in diverse venues, because the input I receive helps inform my decision-making.  
I also want to apologize that you may have received an unusually high volume of emails from me last week.  The information technology company that manages our IT system experienced a technical problem with its server and emails that were supposed to be dispersed over a longer window of time were sent together.  The vendor has assured me that they have corrected the problem, and that it should not happen again.  I’m very sorry for any inconvenience and ANNOYANCE this may have caused you. 
Please continue reading for the highlights of my work last week! 
Reducing the Cost of Rx Drugs 
There is no question that the rising cost of prescription drugs has created a real hardship for most Americans, which is why I have taken an active role in trying to solve the problem.  Too often we have seen the price of lifesaving medication skyrocket due to bad actors taking advantage of monopolies in the market. We witnessed it in 2015, when Turing Pharmaceuticals hiked the price of Daraprim, a drug to treat HIV patients. And, we saw it again with Mylan Pharmaceuticals raising the cost of the EpiPen by 400%. We cannot allow this to continue. Sick people should never be held hostage so a pharmaceutical company can increase its’ profits. 
I authored the Lower Costs Through Competition Act, signed into law last year, and as this article notes, it is already proving effective in achieving its primary goal of lowering the price of prescription drugs.  The new law created an expedited FDA approval process for new generic drugs to compete with either brand name or generic drugs that have no current competition on the market. This important step forward will safely and quickly move life-saving drugs to the market and reduce cost for consumers. 
Last week, the FDA announced approval of the first medication under my provision. 
Similarly, I was encouraged to learn last week that the Department of Health and Human Services is going to allow negotiation of drug prices within the Medicare Advantage programs.  I think this is a great step forward by the Administration as part of its ongoing, coordinated effort with Congress to lower the cost of prescription drugs. It is a great idea to start with Medicare Advantage, a popular and innovative program entirely based upon the premise of competition creating more choices and services that benefit seniors. We can monitor the initiative’s success and determine whether it actually results in lower prescription drug costs so that the concept can be expanded into the entire Medicare population. Please be assured that I will continue to work on this important issue because I understand how important it is to my constituents.  
Fostering Economic Success 
It was a privilege to provide a legislative update to the North Tampa Bay Chamber of Commerce last week. We discussed a wide variety of issues, including: my work on behalf of Veterans, the positive impact that tax reform is having on our economy, school safety and the need for more bi-partisanship in Congress. While visiting, I was honored to receive the Spirit of Enterprise award by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  During the presentation, the Chamber representative highlighted my work on tax reform and other measures to create an environment in which small businesses can thrive. I am proud to support small businesses because they employ the majority of Americans.   
￼ 
It was also great to have the chance to talk with Gordie Zimmerman, a small business owner.  Gordie is the proud owner of Florida Hospital Center Ice in Wesley Chapel, and we discussed his vision for the rink. It is such an impressive facility, and is already attracting tourists from around the world to our community.
Keeping our Kids Safe 
As our kids head back to school, I’d like to thank all of our teachers and school support staff for the positive impact they will have in the lives of our children. I’m also very grateful for the men and women who serve as school resource officers. They work to ensure that all students have a safe learning environment-there is nothing more important! I am working hard to secure additional federal dollars to help fund these critical positions, which will mean that school districts won’t have to keep diverting resources from the classroom to pay for this basic necessity.
Fighting for a Cure 
It is always wonderful to have the chance to meet with the advocates from the Alzheimer’s Association as we strategize about how to ensure continued support among my colleagues for greater investment in critical research that will hopefully yield progress in the development of a cure for this debilitating disease.
￼ 
Ensuring Access to Quality Health Care 
It was an honor to meet with the staff from Tampa Family Health Centers last week to discuss the importance of federally qualified community health centers and the unique role they play in ensuring access to high quality, affordable health care. They thanked me for sponsoring legislation, which was signed into law earlier this year, to reauthorize and provide continued federal funding of community health centers. Over 25 million Americans receive primary care, dental care and mental health services at their local community health center. Community health centers serve the uninsured, underinsured and insured using a sliding fee scale.
￼ 
Honoring and Working on Behalf of our Heroes 
It was a privilege to participate in last week's Purple Heart Day ceremony in Dunedin, a city that takes great pride in honoring the service and sacrifice of our local heroes.
￼ 
It was also a pleasure to join VA Secretary Robert Wilkie at last week’s Jewish War Veterans’ National Convention in Tampa.  It is wonderful to see so many honorable men and women come together-- united in their faith-- to promote Americanism, preserve the spirit of comradery, instill a love of country and service in others, advocate for their fellow Veterans, and honor the memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our country.   
￼ 
Finally, I’d like to thank the Veterans who participated in last week’s Transition Task Force Think Tank Session to generate ideas about additional steps that can be taken to help Veterans as they transition from service to civilian life.  With the help of local leaders in the Veteran community, Brian Anderson and Ben Smeet, we were able to craft the Navy Seal Chief Petty Officer Bill Mulder Transition Improvement Act.  It passed the House last month, and will improve the Transition Assistance Program by individualizing the counseling and training services available during their service so our nation’s heroes can be better prepared for education and employment opportunities after exiting the military.  Through the Forever GI Bill, which became law last year, we expanded educational benefits and removed the time restriction for use. To complement the Forever GI Bill, I introduced legislation which has passed the House.  My bill will also ensure Veterans are able to enroll in their classes, while their application for their education benefits is being processed. I am very grateful these men and women volunteered their time to help us identify areas that still need to be addressed and for their willingness to help make a difference in the lives of future generations of Veterans. 
￼ 
Making our Nation Safer 
I applaud the President’s decision to re-impose sanctions against Iran, a known bad actor on the international stage and state sponsor of terrorism. I have consistently supported sanctions against Iran and other hostile countries, like Russia and North Korea because I believe they are an important diplomatic tool that can, over time, lead to a change in behavior.
Additionally, The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) just released the 2017 Entry/Exit Overstay Report which offers data on departures and overstays for foreign visitors to the U.S. expected to depart in 2017. DHS has determined that there was a total overstay rate of 1.33%, or 701,900 overstay events in 2017. A closer review of the data indicates that the Student Visa Overstay rate was 4.15% for 2017. That is 68,988 students that are in our country and not accounted for. The report highlights the need for my Student Visa Security Improvement Act. My bill will ensure that foreign students who come here on student visas, and the universities that they attend, are held accountable. Tens of thousands of foreign students drop out of school, overstay their visas, and go missing with little effort to track them. This has to stop. It is a matter of national security. Strengthening immigration policies is a critical component of ensuring domestic safety. If we are not saf! e, then nothing else matters. 
Protecting our Four-legged Friends 
As co-Chairman of the Caucus for the Humane Bond, I’m proud to once again co-sponsor legislation which prohibits people from knowingly transporting, possessing, buying, selling, or donating a dog or cat to be slaughtered for human consumption.  You can read more about this important legislation by clicking here.  
Serving the Public 
Congratulations to my District Aide, Bob Hatfield, for being nominated by the Zephyrhills Chamber of Commerce for the Leadership in Government Award. Bob does an outstanding job representing the people of Pasco County, and I am fortunate to have him as a part of our team!￼

A Strong Home Front...
Dear Friend:
As always, I appreciate the opportunity to bring you this quick update. 
￼
U.S. Representative Mike Coffman held a working group meeting at
the Salvadoran consulate in Aurora, CO to discuss immigration on 08/05/18.

Meeting with district residents, advocacy groups, active working groups, site visits to small businesses and nonprofit organizations are all part of what I do when I am fortunate enough to spend time in Colorado. I look forward to these visits to help me understand your concerns and work to address them when I am back in Washington. This past Monday I held a tele/web town hall. Over 4,000 6th Congressional district residents from every corner of the district participated. The call went for more than an hour and provided me an opportunity to field questions on a wide range from national security, to our economy, VA issues, immigration and of course local concerns over affordable housing and healthcare. I want to thank all those who took the time on Monday evening to join this tele/web forum.
At the end of June, I served on the House-Senate conference committee that negotiated the final text of the ‘National Defense Authorization Act’ (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019. The NDAA sets the budget caps for all of the defense-related programs within the Department of Defense (DoD) and the policies that determine how the appropriations will be spent for every DoD program. I am pleased that a number of critical provisions I supported made it through the bipartisan negotiating process and remained in the final bill sent to the President desk. This is the earliest Congress has completed its work on the NDAA in 41 years and the President will sign it into law this upcoming Monday at Fort Drum, New York. We must never waver in ensuring that we have the best trained, best led and best equipped military in the world.

Vice President Mike Pence announced the Trump Administration’s plan on Thursday to create an entirely new branch of military service, the Space Force, with plans to have it operational by 2020. The will require an authorization from the Congress. On Friday, I issued a public statement regarding my opposition to the “Space Force” concept because I strongly feel that it will result in little more than wasteful defense spending, by dramatically expanding the size of the Pentagon’s bureaucracy, with missions that could be more effectively reorganized without creating an entirely new branch of military service. There is no question that we are behind in deploying defensible satellites in space and this deficit in capability makes our entire military vulnerable to the developing anti-satellite tactics of both China and Russia. Prior to the Trump Administration’s decision to go forward with the creation of a Space Force, the Secretary of the U.S. Air Force, Dr. Heather Wilson, publicly stated that she wanted the opportunity to prove that she can provide the necessary focus on space without moving the mission set to a new branch of military service. Let’s at least give her a chance to prove that she can do it.

PRO-AMERICAN, PRO-GROWTH TRADE POLICIES

As I travel around the First District, I have made it a priority to discuss tariffs and trade policy with citizens and local businesses. 

This week, I visited Yoder Metals in Screven. This family run business has experienced the impacts of tariffs on steel and aluminum firsthand. Their feedback on the impact of tariffs on their business is invaluable information for me.  

I was a small business owner before entering public service. Since then, I have dedicated my work to support small businesses and the families they employ. 

That is why, while I wholeheartedly support President Trump's actions to correct the trade imbalance against America, I will continue to work to ensure any action is made in the best interest of American workers and job creators. 

For example, after I heard from a local newspaper about their concerns with the duty investigations into the import of groundwood paper from Canada, I worked with both the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative to ensure they realized the negative impacts that this situation could have on American industries like U.S. newspapers, commercial printing industries, and the paper manufacturing industry. 

I will continue working with President Trump on an America first, pro-growth trade agenda and I want to hear from you. Click here to send me your thoughts on trade and your experiences with recent tariff announcements. 

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CLXXIV

Monday, August 6, 2018: Today I have been invited by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to visit Gray’s Reef National Marine Sanctuary, a federally protected area located 19 miles offshore of Sapelo Island.  NOAA, an American scientific agency located within the Department of Commerce, focuses on the conditions of the oceans, major waterways, and the atmosphere and manages Gray’s Reef, the only protected natural reef on the continental shelf off the Georgia Coast. 
￼
Rep. Carter on NOAA Ship Nancy Foster Research Expedition at Gray’s Reef National Marine Sanctuary
Its value as a natural marine habitat is internationally recognized and the 22 square mile sanctuary is used as a living laboratory for a variety of marine research and monitoring projects.  After meeting up with Michelle Riley, Communications and Public Outreach Coordinator for Gray’s Reef, we head to the dock on Skidaway Island and board the R/V Joe Ferguson where Captain Todd Recicar takes us to meet up with the NOAA ship Nancy Foster.  During the two hour trip, I have the opportunity to meet with some of the participants, including research scientist Dr. Peter Auster from the University of Connecticut, Gray’s Reef Resource Protection Coordinator Becky Shortland and Gray’s Reef Superintendent Scott Kathey.  After learning more about Gray’s Reef and the interesting experiments going on, including one dealing with predators and their prey in the sanctuary, we board the Nancy Foster and receive a warm welcome from Captain Mark Miller and his great crew.  After a tour of the bridge area, we head downstairs where I meet with the highly impressive research scientists on board and learn more about the projects they are working on.  I am very proud to learn that many of the scientists working on this mission are from Georgia Southern University.  Later, we tour the ship and observe the scientists prepping for their many scuba dives to the reef that is 65-70 feet below the surface.  I spend over five hours on the Nancy Foster before re-boarding the Joe Ferguson and heading back to dock.  My experience today was invaluable.  I cannot say enough good things about the crew of the Nancy Foster, about the work these great research scientists are doing with NOAA and especially about the natural treasure that we have right off of the coast of Georgia - Gray’s Reef.

Tuesday, August 7, 2018: This morning I have the opportunity to tour Audiology and Hearing Aid Services in Savannah to learn more about the important services they offer to the community. 
￼
Rep. Carter at Audiology and Hearing Aid Services in Savannah
After a briefing from Dr. Susan Timna where she explains to me the testing of the hearing and balance systems and the health links of untreated hearing loss and its impact on earlier memory problems and other common health issues like diabetes and hypertension, I have a tour of the facility.  Included in my tour is the sound simulation room where people can be tested in noise like they experience every day in restaurants, etc.  Afterwards, I have an interview with two local TV stations that have come along for the tour.  Next, I have a phone interview with The Columbus Dispatch in Columbus, OH, to discuss Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) and their impact on prescription drug pricing.  My next stop is in Midway in Liberty County where I am honored to take part in the grand opening of the Liberty Regional Medical Center East End Clinic.  Along with other elected officials and community leaders, I help cut the ribbon on this much needed facility that will bring quality health care services to the residents of this area.  Afterwards, I head to Hinesville where I am the guest speaker at the Hinesville Rotary Club’s weekly meeting and I have the opportunity to bring them up to date on what’s going on in Washington. 
￼
Rep. Carter at the Hinesville Rotary Club meeting
After my speech, I have the honor of presenting a letter of recognition to one of Liberty County’s finest citizens, Ms. Charmette Reeves, whose dedication to her community is unsurpassed.  Next, I visit Harris Ace Hardware in Hinesville to learn more about this family owned business and discuss the positive impact that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has had on their business.  Combining a large lumber yard with their retail store, Colby Harris and his great staff have built a fine business concentrating on customer service.  Afterwards, I head back to Midway where I meet with the fine folks at Coastal Electric Cooperative and we have a round table discussion about the Farm Bill that is currently being considered in Congress.  Currently there are different versions of the bill in the House and the Senate and we will be working out our differences when we return to Washington after Labor Day.  My final visit of the day is in Screven in Wayne County where I visit another family run business, Yoder Metals.  Tony and Holly Yoder and their beautiful family run a great business but have recently seen significant price increases in their products as a result of tariffs on steel and aluminum.  Their feedback on the impact of tariffs on their business is invaluable information for me.
￼

Wednesday, August 8, 2018:  I’m headed down to St. Simons Island this morning and on the way I have the pleasure of doing a phone interview with the Verb Altitude Hour community radio station in Savannah to discuss what’s going on in Congress.  Once on St. Simons Island, I have the opportunity to speak to state and municipal officials at the Roberts Civil Engineering meet and greet and to bring them up to date on what we’re doing in Washington.  Afterwards, I head to Brunswick where I have the opportunity to speak to the Golden Isles Employment Committee at their monthly meeting.  Next, I head down to St. Marys in Camden County where I tour the property being proposed for Wharf St. Marys and learn more about this exciting project before heading to City Hall to meet with Mayor John Morrissey and city officials who bring me up to date on the many fine projects underway in the community.  After meeting with Councilman Dave Reilly to discuss issues involving the Navy League, I head back to Brunswick and meet with Dr. Kevin Coyle with Consultants in Pain Medicine to discuss the opioid epidemic and learn about the work he does in acute and chronic pain. 
￼
Rep. Carter receives an update on Wharf St. Marys
As a member of Congress and a practicing pharmacist for over 30 years, it is certainly encouraging to know that we have such fine professionals as Dr. Coyle and his staff working in pain management.

Thursday, August 9, 2018:  I’m in Savannah at my district office this morning for a series of meetings beginning with my good friend, Rep. Jesse Petrea, who does an outstanding job of representing the people of the 166th district in the Georgia House of Representatives.  My next meeting is with representatives from Oceana to discuss offshore energy exploration and with whom I have a great discussion.  Next, I meet with a constituent from Pooler to discuss local and national issues before meeting with my good friend Mary Anne Hill who has worked at the federal courthouse in Savannah for many years.

8/12/18 7:01,3 bills for a booming economy,"
￼
￼

Email Update: August 12, 2018  

Dear Lindsey, 

For this weeks newsletter, I wanted to share some of the most significant legislation that Congress has passed to create a booming economy. It is important for our constituents to know that Congress and the administration is fighting for them, and the statistics regarding the economy since the start of this Congress should not be overlooked. Unemployment is at historic lows, job openings are at record highs, paychecks are growing, and wages are rising, right along with economic optimism. 

Below are three big pieces of legislation that the House has passed on behalf of our economy:


1. H.R. 1: The Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law by the President in December 2017. The effects of this new tax code on not only individuals, but the economy, the job market, and the unemployment rate should not go unnoticed. After years of struggling to get ahead, the American people are seeing jobs, opportunity, and confidence come roaring back. Worker pay rate has hit its highest level since 2008, the unemployment rate fell to 3.9%, and the economy added 157,000 jobs in July. Over the next 10 years under our new tax code, the average increase is take home pay for families in Michigan’s 11th District is $28,943. Furthermore, next year when you file your taxes the average family of four in Michigan’s 11th District will see a tax cut of $4,111. We are continuing our work to build on this momentum to keep our economy moving forward-- because we think it’s better to have your paychecks go up, and your taxes go down. To learn more about the new tax code, please follow this link. 

2. S. 2155: The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, was signed into law by the President in May 2018. This bill reflects the most significant pro-growth regulatory relief package in nearly a generation. Approximately half of the bill originated in the House Financial Services Committee and I applaud my fellow committee members for their hard work on this bill. Dodd-Frank’s excessive regulations have contributed to the slowest and weakest economic recovery in 70 years. S. 2155 is important bipartisan legislation that will reduce burdensome and unnecessary red tape that prevents companies from growing and creating more and better jobs. It also addresses those regulatory burdens that hinder Main Street financial institutions from serving their customers through greater credit opportunities. To learn more about this bill, please follow this link. 

3. S. 488: The JOBS and Investor Confidence Act of 2018 is comprised of 32 individual pieces of legislation that passed in the House with broad bipartisan support. I am proud to have supported this legislation because small businesses make up 99% of all enterprises and employ almost half of our American workforce, and we must reform our capital markets. This bill modernizes America’s capital markets and reduces the burdens and complexities of regulations, through these provisions we can encourage more investments in Main Street businesses and help entrepreneurs gain access to capital they need to launch a new startup and create jobs. To learn more about this bill, please follow this link. 

Please know that while more work remains, I can assure you that during my final months in Congress I plan to continue to work for you, voting for bills that will help you more than hurt you and continue to benefit our booming economy. As always, if there is anything that my office can do to be of assistance to you, please do not hesitate to contact either our Troy or Washington offices. 

Thank you and best wishes.

Friends, 
It's been a busy week in the Third District! I'm happy to be back and hearing from my bosses in the Third District.  
I started out the week with UPS. I put on my ""browns"" and helped deliver packages in the Third District! I was able to speak with employees and get a behind-the-scenes tour of their distribution facility.  
￼ 
Later that day, I spoke with the Rotary Club of West Polk County. You can watch a recap of that event from WOI HERE.  
Tuesday, I was a celebrity scooper at the Salvation Army's 10,000 Scoop Challenge. For every scoop that was given out, $1 was donated to charity. I enjoyed speaking with many Iowans about their concerns while I was there.  
￼ 
This week I also visited Blank Children's Hospital to meet with families and hear about the awesome kiddos there who are fighting hard every day. We spoke about the need to protect those with pre-existing conditions and health care costs.  
￼ 
And of course, the Iowa State Fair started this week and I went out there on Day 1! On Saturday, I showed Cyclone in the Governor's Charity Steer Show. On Thursday, I went out and joined his owner Ally from New Virginia and we gave Cyclone a bath and a nice brush!  
￼ 
Those were just a few of the many things I did this week! As always, stay up to date with my travels across the Third District and share your thoughts with me by visiting my Facebook, Twitter, or website.  
Take care,

Hi,  Wildfires have already had a devastating impact on Colorado and the Third District this year, destroying tens of thousands of acres and hundreds of homes. While everybody acknowledges that the frequency and severity of wildfires have increased over the past decade, many in Washington still have been reluctant to make meaningful policy changes to how we maintain forests. Since first coming to Washington, I have worked on the House Committee on Natural Resources to change the way we approach forest health and wildfire prevention away from the status quo that has left our forests overgrown, full of dead timber and unnaturally dense undergrowth.
The answer to reducing the frequency and severity of wildfire in the Western US is multifaceted, but the crux of the problem is in the federal government’s response to these disasters and its overall forest management strategy. 
Up until now, rather than proactively managing federal forests, the U.S. Forest Service’s (USFS) priority has been on fire suppression. This is largely the result of the way in which the federal government treats wildfires from a budgetary perspective. In recent years, USFS’s spending on fire suppression has gone from 15 percent of its overall budget, to a whopping 55 percent. In 2017, the USFS spent over $2 billion on wildfire suppression, making 2017 the most expensive year on record. While the USFS continues neglect forest health to focus on fighting fires, nearly 60 million acres of forest are now at high risk of going up in flames. 
By spending more and more of its budget annually on suppression, the USFS has been forced to divert funds from land management accounts. This practice, otherwise known as “fire borrowing,” has prevented the USFS from carrying out important forest management activities, resulting in overgrown forests where trees compete for limited water and nutrients, leaving them weak and more susceptible to insect and disease infestation. All the while, dead material and unnaturally thick undergrowth has built up, creating a fuel load that burns unnaturally hot and fast when ignited.
To reverse this trend, we must stop being reactive to wildfires and focus greater resources on proactive forest management. Congress included important wildfire funding reforms in the 2018 Omnibus Bill that will allow the USFS to stop fire-borrowing and use more of its budget on active forest management. Under the new structure, $2.25 billion in new budget authority will be available to the USFS and the Department of the Interior (DOI) for wildfire response beginning in 2020. This means that if firefighting costs exceed $1.01 billion in any given year, the USFS and DOI will no longer need to borrow from critical land management accounts to fight catastrophic fires. Instead, they will be able to tap into the new budget authority, similar to how other natural disasters are treated. The money available will increase by $100 million each year until 2027.
Bringing an end to fire-borrowing is a critical if we are to restore the health of federal forests and better prevent future catastrophic wildfires. However, that is just one piece of the puzzle. It is also important that our federal land management agencies implement fuels reduction methods that efficiently eliminate dead and downed timber and unnaturally dense growth that are known to spark wildfires. This can be done in a variety of ways, whether it be through coordination between the federal government and state to identify priority hazardous fuels reduction projects, private-public partnerships or Good Neighbor Agreements.
When we look for solutions to solve any problem facing our lands, we must always consider input from the affected communities and those who have a boots-on-the-ground view of the situation. For that reason, I pushed a provision in the Resilient Federal Forests Act, which passed the House last year, to allow governors to work with impacted county governments and Native American tribes to designate high-risk areas and develop emergency hazardous fuels reduction projects for these endangered areas.
Ranchers across the West also play a key role in the fight against wildfires. When ranchers pay a fee to the Department of Interior to allow their livestock to graze on the public land that intersects with their private rangeland, they create a public-private partnership that is mutually beneficial for the ranchers and land management agencies. When done properly, livestock grazing helps to decrease the overgrowth of foliage on public lands that, when ignited, can lead to fast moving fires.
Good Neighbor Agreements are also an important tool that allows the federal government to utilize the resources and expertise of state and local governments when it comes to managing the forests in their areas. Good Neighbor Agreements allow the Department of the Interior to enter into cooperative agreements with states and territories to perform a variety of management activities, like treatments for insect and disease infested trees and reduce hazardous fuels, and also projects to improve the watershed health. Good Neighbor Agreements have proven to be successful, so much so, that the authority was expanded under the 2018 Omnibus to include reconstruction, repair and restoration of Forest System roads. 
Wildfires are naturally occurring and will forever be a part of life in the West. Fixing the way the federal government funds wildfire suppression and using all of the tools available to coordinate active forest management at the federal, state and local levels will vastly improve forest health and help prevent the frequency and severity of wildfires in the future.
Sincerely,

Congressman Smith's E-news: August 11, 2018 
￼  This week I convened my 2018-2019 Youth Advisory Council with Students from Arapahoe, Auburn, Central City, Gothenburg, Grand Island, Kearney, North Platte, Ogallala, Pierce, Sidney, Valentine, and York. This is one of the highlights of my year because I get to spend time with young people and hear their concerns to ensure we are enabling them for success. 
 Tax Reform 2.0 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was signed into law by President Trump on December 22, 2017 is the first major effort at reforming the tax code in nearly 30 years. As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, I was proud to help draft this legislation.    Throughout the process, I spent a great deal of time traveling around Nebraska’s Third District to hear your concerns and ensure Nebraska had a seat at the negotiating table. As a result, we were able to preserve a number of provisions vital to Nebraskans such as the property tax deduction for farmers, ranchers, and small businesses.    In addition to simplifying compliance and lowering rates, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also included a number of provisions designed to encourage businesses to invest in expansion, such as the increase in bonus depreciation from 50 to 100 percent. By allowing businesses to immediately deduct a large portion of the purchase price of capital goods, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is driving investment into our local economies.    Another provision vital to Nebraska small businesses is the 20 percent deduction for pass through entities, meaning business owners who file one return for their personal taxes combined with their businesses. This deduction is particularly important in order for farmers, ranchers, cooperatives, and other small business owners to see a reduction in their tax burden like the one enjoyed by larger corporations.     As you may have heard, some of the reforms tailored to individuals and small businesses were made temporary in the final version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act due to a lack of votes. The original version I helped to draft and pass through the House would have made these provisions permanent and I am eager to follow through on our original intent.    Tax reform has already proven to be a great success, boosting job creation and growing our economy by more than four percent annually. Even still, there are a number of reforms which could further simplify our tax code and carry this growth into the future.   Our second round of tax reform, dubbed “Tax Reform 2.0,” will focus on making these benefits permanent while improving incentives for families to save and for entrepreneurs to start new businesses. Early conversations have included savings accounts modeled on Roth IRAs in which families can save and have future access to funds, including interest, without paying additional taxes.     Another proposal would allow people to borrow from 401(k)’s for life events like adoption expenses. These changes will help families to save and make better financial decisions both now and over the long term by knowing their money is more accessible.   I have also heard from a number of businesses around Nebraska about the need to ensure Qualified Improvement Properties such as retail and lodging businesses are eligible for bonus depreciation as was intended, and I am working to address this issue in the second round of reforms.    The excitement and consumer confidence generated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is evident throughout the Third District and I can’t wait to further compound this success with yet another round of cuts and simplifications to our tax code. The American people know best how to spend their hard earned tax dollars and my goal will always be to help you keep more of your paycheck.     My Schedule this Week 
This week, constituents will be able to meet directly with me to discuss issues such as tax reform, trade, immigration, and the Farm Bill at events in Crawford, Gering, Grand Island, and Kearney. If you have time, I hope you'll stop by.

In West Plains, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has made it easier for Ozark Machinery Company to make new investments and expand. Owner Jeff Barber was kind enough to show me around the business as we talked through the new tax code, which I helped write and send to President Trump's desk.

Years ago Matt Upchurch's grandfather was drilling for oil when he found something else flowing from the ground - water! Today next to the Woodland School in Marble Hill is an artesian well where community members can catch a cold drink of water on a hot day, courtesy of mother nature and the Upchurch family. A massive thunderstorm rolled in during our agriculture summit but we didn't mind getting soaked, we know how many farmers have been praying for rain like that!
￼

At Burke Farms in Mississippi County, local family farmers showed me how the latest drones and applications used on farms today help save precious time and resources. Farming is hard work with volatile markets, every little bit makes a big difference!

￼

I want to know what priorities you think Congress should focus on. Do you have a second to share what issues are important to you?

Weekly Update: Veterans - Better Off Now By Congressman Rob Wittman August 11, 2018  Since the dawn of our nation, our Armed Forces have stood up and fought for our freedom; we sleep soundly because of their bravery. Our Veterans made great sacrifices for us on the battlefield and we owe them a debt of gratitude for that service. Nearly 800,000 call Virginia home, and I am committed to ensuring our veterans can access the benefits they've earned through their service to a grateful nation.  This Congress, the House has made landmark changes for our nation’s heroes. America’s veterans deserve the highest quality medical care and most efficient delivery of benefits possible. Although the vast majority of employees at the VA are honest and hardworking, it is unfair to the good employees when the VA refuses to or cannot hold bad actors accountable. The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 created a streamlined and efficient process to remove, demote or suspend any VA employee for poor performance or misconduct. The VA MISSION Act consolidated the VA’s multiple community care programs and authorities and provides further funding to sustain the Choice Program so veterans can get the care they earned and deserve.  The House has also passed the Forever GI Bill - Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act to enhance or expand education benefits for veterans, servicemembers, families and survivors, and the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act to expand VA benefits to approximately 90,000 sailors who served off the coast during the Vietnam War. I myself have introduced three pieces of legislation that would bring further accountability to the VA.  One of my favorite parts of my job is meeting with veterans around the First District. Below are some of my fondest memories of the past few months:  
￼
I held a meeting of my First District Veteran’s Council where I got to hear from our nation’s heroes about what they need from us in Congress to ensure they receive the benefits they have earned.

￼
I spoke at the opening of the new Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA) program at Quantico. MSSA provides job training to service members transitioning to civilian life and careers in technology. Programs like this provide our veterans with tailored training opportunities to be successful in today’s job market.

￼
I held a Voices of Veterans Event in Fredericksburg with House Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Roe and representatives from the VA in Fredericksburg for a conversation with First District Veterans.

￼
I had the privilege of thanking some of our nation’s heroes in Fredericksburg as they returned home from their Honor Flight.

Our nation’s servicemen and women and our veterans have truly made the United States the greatest nation in the world, and I am grateful every day for their dedicated service. We honor the warriors who have given the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. It is up to us now to take care of those who stood willing to make that same sacrifice.

BACK IN OKLAHOMA It’s been great to be back in Oklahoma for the August district work period.
I want to thank the team at Pafford EMS in Stilwell for showing me around their location. We talked about ensuring continued rural EMS coverage, public safety officer benefits for EMTs, and other EMS related issues. Access to health care is vital, especially in our rural communities. I will continue to work in Congress to ensure our communities have access to the care they need.  
￼
 On Wednesday, I also visited the new Adair County Courthouse in Stilwell. Thanks to Commissioner Chandler for taking me on a tour of the new and improved courthouse!  
￼
It was great to visit the NEMA ABB Baldor plant in Westville where electric motors are produced.  Since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, the United States now has 6.6 million job openings—many of them for skilled labor. The workers at Baldor in Westville are a part of that skilled labor workforce and I was proud to visit their plant and learn about some of their day-to-day operations.  
￼

￼
I stopped by the Northeast Tech Claremore Campus for their business after hours and open house. It was great to visit with teachers at NTC and get a tour of their facility. 
￼
On Friday, I hosted a Senior Information Fair at Go Ye Village in Tahlequah to allow constituents who had questions or issues with the Social Security Administration or other federal agencies to visit with me and members of my team to provide answers and assistance. Many people aren’t aware that my office can help serve as a liaison between individuals and federal agencies. Whether you come to our office or we come to you, we want to let people know that we’re always here to help.  
￼

￼
Couldn't make the event in Tahlequah? We're hosting another Seniors Information Fair on Thursday, August 23rd in Claremore. Hope to see you there!

GOOD NEWS FOR SMALL BIZ Small business is the backbone of our nation’s economy—making up 99% of U.S. businesses. More good news for our small businesses: a recent poll says “U.S. small-business owners are more optimistic now than at any point in the 15-year history of the Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index.” Read the survey here.  
￼
RELEASE PASTOR BRUNSON In 2016, Turkish militia attempted a coup to overthrow the government and unseat Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In the aftermath, President Erdogan vowed to never extradite terrorists to the United States again, including alleged “terrorist” Pastor Andrew Brunson, an American who was arrested by Turkish police in 2016 after the attempted coup for terrorism and espionage. Pastor Brunson deserves his right to religious freedom and must be released immediately. Read more in this week’s Mullin It Over.  OK-2 SPOTLIGHT It was an honor to recognize Anisa Ripp on her achievement of Girl Scout Gold Award! Anisa graduated from Inola High School earlier this year and will be attending Missouri S&T at Rolla in the fall. She plans to major in Geological Engineering. Congratulations to Anisa on reaching the highest honor in the Girl Scouts!

 See more from this past week on my Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr pages and as always, don’t hesitate to contact me if I can help in any way.

August 6

May River Excursions: As we wind our way through August, I want to give a quick shout out to Chris Shoemaker with May River Excursions in Bluffton.
The picture below is of him driving one of his boats, as we made our way back at the beginning of summer from Bluffton over to Daufuskie. He had been kind enough to get roped in by Tabor Vaux into giving me a ride over, though Tabor was kind enough to give me a ride back to Bluffton later that afternoon. We were both headed for the ribbon cutting of the new community park on Daufuskie. It was a joyous occasion and great afternoon, and it continues to amaze me the way that places like Daufuskie have changed from the Daufuskie that I knew when I was in high school.
But back to my shoutout about Chris. I admire anyone who’s bold enough to follow their dreams.
In his case, rather than doing the conventional, he decided to open up May River Excursions. Initially, it wasn’t much. He had one boat and took people out. As a consequence of a lot of hard work and a dream connected to it, it’s grown to be something much more than that - and as I watched him that afternoon as we ran the back way between Bluffton and Daufuskie, I was struck by what a great life he had carved for himself.
There’s a lesson in there for all of us….

Long-Term Budget Outlook: We are continuing to sleepwalk our way into a financial crisis. It's the reason I ran for Congress, and it’s a reason I took all those 'no' votes that I was criticized for in the campaign that ended in June.
We need more 'no' votes in Washington to have any hope of turning around what was just highlighted in the Congressional Budget Office’s Long-Term Budget Outlook for 2018 that was released recently.
Unless we radically change the spending trajectory in Washington, this movie is not going to end well, and it’s going to have incredible impacts in the value of your savings, the value of the dollar, and future inflation.
In short, everything that you may have saved over the course of your life could be substantially devalued. Click here to read more....

Tri-County Waterfront Park: Last week, I promised to send the op-ed that I had written in 2006 regarding the Daniel Island park. Again, I think of this to be a very important idea at an inflection point here in Charleston with regard to infrastructure, urbanization, and density within the Tri-County area.
I’d ask that you give it a read and think about a way in which you might be involved in this effort, and involve others. The op-ed is included in the text below - but I’ve also taken the liberty of including an article that ran in The Daniel Island News this week. Click here to read more...

Annual Trustees Report for Social Security: The reason that I have spoken out as I have with regard to both the President’s Budget and the Congressional Budget is that they are make believe when it comes to the real driver of expense at the federal level.
 As I have said many times, we are walking our way toward the most predictable financial crisis in the history of man. Here’s another data point on that front. According to the Annual Trustees Report for Social Security, this year is the first time in more than three decades that the program will actually pay more out in benefits than it collects in taxes.
 What makes this even more alarming is the fact that Social Security (along with Medicare and Medicaid) are the main drivers of the growing debt and deficit. And with Social Security, a big part of the problem is demographics where the math simply doesn’t add up. Here’s a quick look at the numbers:  In 1950, there were 16 workers paying into Social Security for every 1 retiree receiving benefits. By 1960, that ratio was 5 workers to every 1 retiree. Today, there are 3 workers for every 1 retiree. As a broad policy, it was a tax on the American public given life expectancy in 1940 was 61 for men and 65 for women, while the retirement age was 65. Bad news though for the government, Americans managed to start living much longer. Today, Americans on average are living 10 years longer due to the advances in medicine and technology, and so the numbers don’t even come close to working from an actuarial standpoint.  On all of this, a picture says more than words, and accordingly, I'd ask that you take a look at the chart below...

￼


Dear Friend,  Tuesday, communities around the country participated in the 35th Annual National Night Out. This event brings communities and local law enforcement officers together for a fun evening that promotes awareness on crime and drug prevention. It is near and dear to my heart and it is a great cause. During my time as Sheriff, I attended every National Night Out and have continued to enjoy this event over the years. It is so rewarding to be part of our society coming together and discovering that we all want the same thing for our families: a neighborhood where families can have a safe and secure place for their kids, where children can take walks, ride bikes and play in the parks.  This is why it was so devastating when two officers were ambushed and shot at a National Night Out event in Camden, New Jersey. This event brings communities together and is a reflection of what our country should be doing. Targeting one another in violence is wrong. Our law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day to protect us and keep our communities safe. We should stand together as communities and as a country in supporting them and stand up against the horrific violence we see.  Helping Those Who Face Identity Theft  In today’s world of increasing technology, the threat of identity theft is growing. For social security beneficiaries, having their identity stolen can mean months or even years of frozen payments until the record is corrected. That is why I am proud the House passed H.R. 6084, the Improving Social Security’s Service to Victims of Identity Theft Act, which I cosponsored. This legislation holds the Social Security Administration to a new standard of customer service and requires a more systematic process for helping victims of identity theft resolve their problem and get them the benefits they deserve quickly.  Meeting a Hero  I had the true privilege of meeting Leroy Petry during his visit to the U.S. Capitol. Leroy was awarded the prestigious Medal of Honor by President Obama in 2011 for his courageous actions in combat in Afghanistan. 
￼
District Happenings  TODAY: Great American Yard and Antique Sale  The Puyallup Historical Society is back at it again with their Great American Yard and Antique Sale at the historical Meeker Mansion. Come as a buyer and peruse through antiques and artifacts from local collections or as a seller and show off your best stuff. Either way, this event will offer any participant a fun and unique experience.  EVENT DETAILS When: Saturday, August 11, 9am-4pm  Where: 312 Spring Street, Puyallup  TODAY: AuburnFest  Don’t miss AuburnFest, a summertime family-fun festival. There will be live entertainment; great food; crafts; specialty, community and non-profit vendors; a car show; a literary showcase and several free activities including Bocce, face painting, and an indoor playground. But that’s not all – a super slide, pony rides, mini golf, and rock climbing will all be part of the family fun at this community event.   EVENT DETAILS When: Saturday, August 11th, 11:00am–7:00pm. Where: Les Gove Park, 910 9th Street SE, Auburn  SUNDAY: Movies Off Main  Join the Sumner Arts Commission for outdoor movies with the one and only, Back to the Future.  EVENT DETAILS When: 8:30pm-10:00pm Where: Reuben A.

8/11/18 10:15,Fixing Our Democracy –– in Baltimore and Across America,"
 
￼


Dear Friend, 
On Wednesday, I held a panel discussion in Baltimore to highlight the many exciting democracy reform initiatives taking place around the country at the local, state and federal levels. 

￼ 
 
￼ 

Maryland has led a nationwide effort to fix our democracy, reduce the corrosive influence of wealthy and well-connected special interests and return power to the people -- where it belongs.  

Across our great state -- including in Montgomery County, Howard County, and most recently, in Baltimore City -- committed citizens and thoughtful legislators have joined forces to advance positive reforms that will help improve the responsiveness, transparency and accountability of state and local government.  

As Chair of the Democracy Reform Task Force in Congress, I am fighting to advance similar reforms at federal level. (See here to learn more about these empowering reforms.)  

￼ 

Wednesday's panel discussion could not have occurred without the support and generosity of my fellow panelists -- Baltimore City Councilman Kristerfer Burnett (bottom right), Damon Effingham of Common Cause Maryland (bottom left) and Emily Scarr of Maryland PIRG.  

￼ 

I am truly inspired by the energy and passion that my fellow Marylanders share for the transformative democracy reforms taking hold in our state. The progress we make at the state and local levels will help pave the way for a once-in-a-generation reform agenda in Congress. And when we ultimately succeed in this important and noble effort, we can put the American people back in charge of our democracy and return to government of, by and for the people. 
 Sincerely,  ￼ John P. Sarbanes Maryland's Third Congressional District

IMPROVING GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY
￼
I believe your government needs to be accountable to you, the American people. That’s why the House has recently passed numerous bills aimed at making government more accountable, reining in out-of-control bureaucrats, and saving taxpayer dollars.
Holding the IRS Accountable
￼
We can no longer accept the status quo at the IRS, where too often misconduct and poor performance go unpunished. 
Hoosiers should be able to trust that the agency responsible for handling our most sensitive financial data is being managed by dependable and honest individuals.
With my support, the House recently passed H.R. 3500, the Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act. This commonsense bill will end the practice of rehiring employees who were fired for falsifying or mishandling sensitive taxpayer information.
We also passed bipartisan legislation to overhaul the IRS, including a measure I introduced to strengthen IRS accountability for modernizing its technology. This is a big step toward bringing the IRS into the 21st century, restoring a culture of accountability, and putting taxpayers first.
Supporting Our Veterans
￼
We’ve made a promise to the brave men and women of our nation’s military to take care of them when they return home as veterans.
This starts with staffing our VA with the best possible hands to care for our heroes. The House recently took action to make good on our nation’s promise by passing legislation with my support that would make critical changes to the Veterans Health Administration’s hiring system by establishing qualifications for human resources positions to ensure the VA is recruiting and retaining highly qualified professionals.
Last year, Congress also passed the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act. This law has helped restore a culture of accountability to the VA by giving the VA secretary new tools to punish wrongdoing, protect whistleblowers, and fill critical leadership positions.
This is a critical step, but there is more work to do. I recently testified before the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee on ways to improve leadership and accountability at the VA, starting with better hiring practices. You can watch a video of my remarks by clicking the image above.
￼
Helping Victims of Identity Theft
The bureaucracy of the Social Security Administration often makes it difficult for Americans who fall victim to identity theft to receive the swift help they need to get their life back on track. The House has taken an important step toward streamlining the process of receiving help from the agency.
We passed H.R. 6084, the Improving Social Security’s Service to Victims of Identity Theft Act. By creating a single point of contact for requesting a new Social Security number due to identity theft or for help resolving identity theft issues related to their Social Security benefits, it will ensure individual cases are tracked and coordinated to completion as quickly as possible.

As always, it is a privilege to represent 2nd District Hoosiers in Congress.

Rebuilding Our Military and Improving Care and Benefits for Veterans
Since serving in Congress, I’ve repeatedly said there are three groups I’ll never apologize for supporting: the men and women of our Armed Forces who put themselves in harm’s way to keep us free; veterans who have honorably served our country; and farmers because of the work they do day in and day out to keep our food supply strong. On Thursday, July 26, I cast one of the most important votes I take each year – a vote to send a bill to the president’s desk to provide funding for our military.
This year’s legislation, the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, provides $717 billion to continue our work to rebuild our military, and I was proud to support it. The men and women who serve this country deserve to have the best equipment and training in the world, but the previous administration’s cuts to military spending put our servicemembers and national security at risk. When you have more members of the military killed in training exercises than combat, you’re doing something wrong.
This self-induced crisis must end, and the FY19 NDAA will help restore the power and capability of the best military in the world. I’m also extremely proud this legislation includes a 2.6 percent pay raise for our troops – the largest in nearly a decade. This is on top of last year’s 2.4 percent pay raise, so we are keeping our commitment to take care of those who keep us safe and free. In addition, the NDAA provides critical funding to improve missile capabilities and upgrade combat equipment. As the world becomes more and more dangerous, it’s more important than ever we invest in a strong national defense.
Last year’s NDAA paved the way for an increase of more than 20,000 active-duty and reserve troops. In addition to supporting strong investment in our military, I’m also working to improve benefits for veterans so if a servicemember chooses to return to civilian life after their service, they have access to education benefits that will help them find good-paying jobs. One of the best examples of this is the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, or Forever GI Bill. This bill was signed into law by President Trump last August.
The Forever GI Bill removes time restrictions to use the GI Bill, enabling future eligible recipients to use their GI bill benefits for their entire lives as opposed to the previous 15-year timeline. It also simplifies the benefit for future servicemembers by consolidating the GI Bill into a single program over time, which will reduce Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative costs. The law also provides significant increases in GI Bill funding for Reservists and Guardsmen, dependents, surviving spouses and surviving dependents. It provides 100 percent GI Bill eligibility to Post 9/11 Purple Heart recipients. In addition, the Forever GI Bill restores eligibility for servicemembers whose school closes in the middle of a semester and creates a pilot program that would pay for veterans to take accelerated learning programs in technology courses. The GI Bill has been an invaluable recruitment tool, and I was proud to be the lead sponsor and author of this important update to education benefits for veterans.
We’re also working to improve health care for veterans. Another piece of legislation I authored, the VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks (MISSION) Act, will allow veterans greater flexibility when choosing where to get their health care. The VA MISSION Act was signed into law in June, and will ensure veterans have access to the timely and quality health care they earned. This law puts VA back on track to fulfilling its main mission: to care for the men and women who have borne the battle. The VA MISSION Act streamlines the department’s duplicative community care programs into one cohesive program, creates a non-partisan process for reviewing VA’s assets to ensure veterans can access the care they deserve and expands VA’s Post-9/11 Caregiver Program to all eras. These reforms are supported by many Veterans Service Organizations. 
While we’ve made a great deal of progress to rebuild our military and improve care and benefits for veterans, there is much left to do. You can rest assured I will continue fighting until the men and women who serve have access to the resources they need and the benefits they have earned.
My door is always open to East Tennesseans. Feel free to contact my office if I can be of assistance to you or your family.

Miguel Angel Corea Diaz is a leader of the feared MS-13 gang, known for decapitating people with machetes.   He is also a big crybaby who isn't holding up well in a county jail.  Corea Diaz complained to a judge last week of “unbearable” conditions.  What's his beef? The other inmates call him names and he's not allowed to use his cell phone.   His nickname is ""Reaper"" but it might as well be ""Whiner.""  Read the article below and see for yourself why the U.S. Senate needs to pass the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act and deport Corea Diaz and the rest of his buddies. Maybe he will get better cell service inside an El Salvadoran prison.   Vern

MS-13's alleged East Coast leader decries jail conditions 
Bridget Murphy 
The New Jersey man whom prosecutors identified as the East Coast leader for the notoriously violent MS-13 gang portrayed himself as a devoted father in a recent plea to a Nassau judge, saying he was suffering in lockdown at the county’s jail.  Miguel Angel Corea Diaz, 35, spoke while handcuffed and guarded by court officers as he begged acting State Supreme Court Justice Patricia Harrington to intervene to improve the conditions of his local imprisonment.  “Discrimination. I’m suffering in this county. They call me ‘El Chapo.’ Die, scary guy,” Corea Diaz said on July 31 in Nassau County Court, referencing the accused Mexican drug kingpin who Brooklyn prosecutors say smuggled 20 tons of cocaine into the United States and is awaiting trial.  Corea Diaz also told the judge in court he has received “a lot of death threats,” but they weren’t coming from inside Nassau’s jail.  Prosecutors have accused Corea Diaz of carrying out major drug trafficking and conspiring on Long Island to commit murder. At his April arraignment, he pleaded not guilty to three counts of operating as a major drug trafficker and five counts of second-degree conspiracy.  He was one of 17 suspects named in a January indictment that authorities said delivered a heavy blow to MS-13’s infrastructure after a probe that included a $1 million heroin seizure and the foiling of murder plots involving a Long Island clique of the gang.  MS-13 gang members have killed at least 25 people in Nassau and Suffolk counties since 2016, authorities have said. President Donald Trump, who has blamed gang violence and other crime on illegal immigration, came to Brentwood in July last year and described some Long Island neighborhoods as a “bloodstained killing fields” that are “under siege” and need to be liberated from MS-13.  The Nassau district attorney’s office has alleged that Corea Diaz, known on the street as “Reaper,” reported directly to the transnational gang’s leaders in El Salvador and said he faces up to 25 years to life in prison if convicted of the top charge against him.  But Corea Diaz spoke of himself as a family man who misses his children.  “I’m a human being, I have a family. I have children. . . . I’m not able to talk to them,” the Salvadoran citizen told Harrington through a Spanish-language translator. “It’s about time that I speak to them because when I get deported, I don’t know if I’m going to be able to speak to them again.”  The defendant’s attorney, Scott Gross, told the judge his client has been locked in a cell for about 23 hours a day at Nassau County’s jail and only has “limited access to a phone.”  “The conditions have been unbearable,” the Garden City lawyer said in his second recent court appeal for an improvement in his client’s jail housing.  In April, authorities extradited Corea Diaz to New York from Maryland, where he was jailed in Prince George’s County Detention Center on felony drug charges. Gross said in an interview his client was in the Maryland jail’s general population and hasn’t been involved in any incidents at Nassau’s jail.

Friend, 
I hope you are having an enjoyable summer. We have been staying busy traveling the district, meeting with constituents, and listening to what's on your mind. See below for pictures of a few highlights from the road. As always, you can follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for even more updates.

Honoring our Veterans
￼ 
It was a true privilege to be at the Jackson County Fair this week to present Vietnam-era veterans with their 50th anniversary pins. We are forever indebted to those who answered America’s call to service. It is our duty to uphold our commitments to our veterans, and in Congress, I am working to ensure they have access to timely, high quality care. 

Standing up for Seniors
￼ 
We owe it to Michigan’s seniors to keep our promise of a solvent Social Security Administration. After a lifetime of work and payment into the system, it is only fair to expect what was originally promised. I had the opportunity to visit the Monroe Center for Healthy Aging and share my commitment to protect Social Security. 

Enhancing Skills Education
￼ 
To boost Michigan's economy, we need to continue to invest in a skilled workforce and inspire the next generation to pursue meaningful careers in manufacturing and technology. Places like the Jackson Area Career Center, where I met with students taking the Introduction to Robotics class, are leading the way. These type of innovative programs help students gain valuable skills and ignite interest in manufacturing and technology. 

Supporting our Farmers
￼ 
It was great to visit with Lenawee County farmers at the Center for Excellence Field Day this week. Thank you to Raymond & Stutzman Farm in Morenci for hosting this event. We discussed a number of important agriculture issues, including the MAEAP program and aiding farmers to improve conservation. 

Strengthening the Great Lakes Economy
￼ 
With my support, the House recently passed the Water Resources Development Act, a bipartisan bill that provides improvements for ports, locks, ecosystem restoration, and other waterway infrastructure projects. Having well-maintained ports, like the Port of Monroe, is critical to Michigan's economic competitiveness. I stopped by the Port of Monroe this week to get an update from Director Paul LaMarre and discuss water infrastructure and the Great Lakes economy.

Celebrating small business



Dear Friend: 
Welcome to your weekly update. As always, you can learn more about these and other legislative issue at my website: upton.house.gov. 
Celebrating small business
The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is celebrating its 65th year as the key resource for America’s small businesses and entrepreneurs. Since its founding in 1953, the SBA has connected small business owners to the mentors, funding, training, and other critical resources to help Americans build and grow their businesses. 
In Michigan, SBA lending grew 15% and the number of total loans supported by SBA exceeded $1 billion. In 2017 alone, SBA facilitated over 2,700 loans to small businesses in Michigan.
This week, I met with Latifa Bradwell, an SBA Member, in Cass County to discuss programs and economic development in our area. 
My top priority is promoting job creation and economic growth here at home in Southwest Michigan. To learn more about my work, please click here. 
For SBA resources, please click here. 
Thank a Purple Heart recipient 
On Wednesday, we reflected on Purple Heart Day and are reminded of our responsibility to the men and women who serve our country. 
It is important to ensure our military has the resources necessary to carry out their national security objectives, including funding and efforts to begin to close the readiness gaps our troops are facing. With new investments in training, equipment, and personnel, we have begun to reverse the damage and provide our servicemembers with the tools they need to protect our nation. 
Our work continues, and that is why the FY19 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and is so important. The NDAA passed Congress, with my support, and currently sits on the President’s desk to be signed into law.
Tax reform is working
After historic tax reform, unemployment is at historic lows, paychecks are growing, and wages are rising. 
Thanks to tax reform, 36,177 new jobs will be created in Michigan and our district will see an average of $16,856 increase in take-home pay per household over the next 10 years.
Last month, Pfizer announced a major expansion in Kalamazoo County thanks to tax reform and will include the creation of hundreds of good-paying jobs and nearly $500 million in new investments. 
Back at home
With no votes in the House until September, I am back in Southwest Michigan for the August District Work Period. 
To stay up to date on my work here at home this summer, follow my Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter pages.
Have a great weekend and God bless,
-Fred

District Offices
As we begin August recess I'd like to highlight the services provided by my district offices. Many folks don't realize that I have offices located right in the district for your convenience. Unfortunately, dealing with government agencies is often a frustrating and difficult process. My district staff help manage this interaction and inquire on constituents’ behalf to ensure a quicker and hopefully less stressful resolution.
We are in contact with a number of agencies including: Housing and Urban Development, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, IRS, Department of Labor, passport services, Social Security, Medicare, Veterans Affairs, and more.  If you need help reaching out to a government agency you can request casework here or you can call my Jonesboro office at: 870-203-0540.
FAQ (What folks have been calling/texting my office about this week)
Q: I've heard some very concerning audio clips of a speech Rep. Nunes gave at a fundraiser, what does the Congressman plan on doing to prevent this rhetoric from spreading in Congress? 
A: I often discuss how we should be cautious consumers of media and this is no exception. We must be mindful that a few clips from a long speech can easily be taken out of context. A brief audio clip doesn't accurately depict our findings from a year long investigation. Representative Nunes and I have participated in a lengthy examination into foreign interference in our elections, and he knows the very real threat that this poses to our democracy. I will continue to work with him on the House Intelligence Committee and will see that he continues to take this seriously as he has been doing.

• $15,878 – Average increase in take-home pay for 1st District families over next 10 years because to tax reform
• $300 million - Amount of wealth that has been repatriated from foreign countries because of tax reform.
• 17-Year High - Consumer confidence level hits highest mark since 2001.
• 86% - Percentage of manufacturers reporting they’ve made plans to increase investment because of tax reform
• 6.7 million – Number of job openings. First time since 2000 that there are more open jobs than unemployed individuals.
• 3.7 million – Jobs created since November 2016.
• 4 million – Number of workers who have already seen benefits handed down from their company because of tax reform.

ICYMI: McKinley Fights for Retired Coal Miners
Last week, I led a letter to the leadership of the Joint Select Committee on Multi-Employer Pension Plans, urging them to address the looming insolvency of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) 1974 Pension Plan. The bipartisan letter was signed by 25 Members of Congress.

It’s critical that Congress finds a bipartisan solution to the looming multi-employer pension crisis. In particular, we must find a solution for the 105,000 coal miners and retirees covered by the UMWA Pension Plan. These workers put their lives on the line every day to produce the fuel that powered our nation’s economic engine for decades.

We can’t kick the can down the road any longer. Let’s come together and pass this legislation so that coal miners and their loved ones have the peace of mind they deserve and know the benefits they earned won’t be threatened.

Greetings friend:
 
This week was a great opportunity for me to meet constituents!
 
￼
 
I enjoyed my time visiting with constituents who attended my Open Office Hours this week, where I was able to have a dialogue with everyone who came through the door.  I value this time, it is a productive way of hearing a person’s concerns, and an opportunity for me to answer questions on immigration, the current administration, taxes and tax reform, the current administration, federal deficit and spending, Medicare and Medicaid.  
 
You can watch and listen recordings of the entire open office hours by clicking here. 
 
￼
 
I addressed several constituent questions about town hall meetings.  That specific dialogue can be viewed here. 
 
￼
 
During the office hours I was also able to speak more on my questions about trade and tariffs.  I am concerned about the effect of the Administration trade policies.
 
You can listen to the concerns I shared with a constituent regarding trade and tariffs at Open Office Hours here.

I met with White House advisors Larry Kudlow and Peter Navarro on trade last week. You can read this news report here.

The Night Out Against Crime is always a great community event. 
 
￼
￼
 
I was able to attend a few gatherings in West Jordan this week.  It’s great to talk to people about their concerns about crime in their neighborhoods—or anything else!

Grassley Direct
I wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post about how my Judiciary Committee is conducting the most thorough and transparent confirmation process of any Supreme Court nominee to date. I'm ready to work to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh and I invite my colleagues to join me. 
Q&A: Clean Energy 
Q. How does clean energy help Iowa's economy? Q. Is the United States getting closer to achieving energy independence? 
Quick Links
I released five videos, one every day this week, looking back at memorable moments from my annual 99 county meetings and how they have helped inform my work for Iowans. I hold at least one question-and-answer session with Iowans in each of Iowa’s 99 counties annually, and have done so every year since I was elected to the United States Senate. This week, I held meetings in 17 different counties. In these video addresses, I recall freezing the 1986 Reagan Defense Budget, the passage and repeal of the 1989 Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, the 1991 Persian Gulf War vote, the 2009 Obamacare debate and the 2016 Supreme Court vacancy.  
The United States can’t afford to take a back seat to any competitor. In the American heartland, factories and farms are the lifeblood of good people working hard to make a decent living. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and I wrote an op-ed about how we are championing stronger oversight tools to help ensure long-term economic interests aren’t lost for good. Keeping our eyes on the road ahead will help ensure America’s brightest days are yet to come, not relegated to the rear-view mirror.
America's leading wind energy advocates presented me with the ""U.S. Wind Champion Award"" in honor of American Wind Week. Wind is a critical part of our nation’s all-of-the-above energy strategy. It creates thousands of jobs, generates billions of dollars across Iowa and the nation, it’s safe for the environment and it helps ensure American energy independence. Wind is an efficient, cost-effective energy alternative. I’m proud to support wind energy and I’ll continue to do what I can in the Senate to help it grow and flourish. 
Oversight is about keeping faith with the taxpayers and working to give the American people confidence that their government plays by the rules and, if it doesn’t, it is held accountable. Health care is an issue that requires constant attention because it directly affects the life of every American. Health care consumers deserve to know how their money is being spent and whether the procedures they’re receiving are safe. Learn more about what I'm doing in this area here, here and here. 
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he’d oppose the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court “with everything I’ve got.” This was before he read the judge’s 307 written opinions, reviewed the more than 17,000 pages Judge Kavanaugh provided to the committee in response to our bipartisan questionnaire or the estimated one million pages of documents the committee has requested from the Bush White House. The next time you hear complaints about the Senate Judiciary Committee’s vetting process—the most extensive and transparent in history—remember Mr. Schumer’s pledge to oppose Judge Kavanaugh with everything he’s got.

Dear Friend,  Once a year, the entire Nebraska delegation gathers at the SAC Museum in Ashland for high-level discussions of federal policy. This year’s “summit” was well attended by people from across the state. As important as these DC dynamics are, potentially more meaningful was what was being discussed at the local pub and grill. As I walked in for lunch, I saw an important ritual well under way. A group of men sat at one table. A group of women sat at another. They all wore the same Ashland-Greenwood t-shirt. I asked, “What is going on here? I didn’t get the t-shirt.” They were teachers, celebrating the beginning of the school year!   
End of summer, beginning of fall, school starts, football season kicks off. After the understandable melancholy that comes with the end of vacation season, and you start to consider your next adventure, I encourage you to pay a visit to our nation’s capital.   
First, you are welcome at the Nebraska Breakfast. This time-honored tradition, unique to Capitol Hill, offers the opportunity for you to meet with the entire delegation and hear about important legislative updates. This year marks the Nebraska Breakfast’s 75th anniversary. It is the oldest such gathering on Capitol Hill.    
On your DC bucket list, you are likely to have these attractions: The White House; the Capitol; the Pentagon; the Supreme Court; and the Federal Bureau of Investigations, which recently resumed tours after a 17-year post-9/11 hiatus. One of my favorite traditional stops is the Library of Congress. I call it “the gem of America,” and I have proposed that we start using this name: America’s Library.  
A national historic landmark that might be off your radar is the Marine Barracks, one of the oldest buildings in DC and the official residence of the Marine Corps Commandant. The Marine Corps Band and Drill Team perform there and at the Iwo Jima Memorial at various times during the summer. Also off the radar of most visitors is the Old Post Office Tower. At 12 stories high, it offers 360-degree views of the Capitol, Reagan Airport, and the surrounding DC area. The 9/11 Pentagon Memorial features a large garden with “Memorial Unit” benches for each of the 184 victims of the horrific attack. If I had to pick one thing, however, it would be the changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery. My grandfather is buried there.   
Please visit the Capitol! We are eager to help you navigate the House and Senate chambers and the historic surroundings. If you visit during a vote in the House of Representatives, you will find the scene to be quite diverse, a bit loud, with people huddling in various corners discussing legislation. Should there be an opportunity, I can make a concerted effort, no matter where I am on the Hill, to meet you.   
Sometimes visitors experience spontaneous and exciting opportunities. At one unanticipated moment last month, two Nebraska families had come to visit. In my office at the time was the Ambassador of Jordan. She graciously received the visitors, and willingly participated in an interview with a Nebraska agriculture journalist, discussing potential opportunities between our state and her country. To show you how important these meetings are, at the end of radio interview, the Ambassador proudly declared, “Go Big Red!”   Sincerely, ￼  Congressman Jeff Fortenberry 

P.S. If you would like to send my office an email reply, please visit my website, Fortenberry.house.gov, or communicate with me on my Facebook and Twitter pages.

 Dear Friend,   Americans are sick and tired of feeling like government is not working for them. And, with President Trump and Republicans in Congress dead set on giving the store away to Wall Street, wealthy political donors, and powerful special interests – at the expense of everyone else – it’s no wonder over 80 percent of Americans feel they can’t trust elected officials in Washington to do what is right.  Democrats have come up with a bold plan to fix our broken political system and return to a government that works for the people. Our plan would:  • Fix our broken campaign finance system and eliminate the pervasive influence of corporate money in politics.  • Strengthen our nation’s ethics laws to fight special interests, and hold Washington accountable.  • Empower American voters to ensure a responsive government.  The Trump administration, with the GOP Congress by his side, is working hand-in-hand with big polluters, Wall Street, and big pharma. Together, they’re driving up the cost of prescription drugs and healthcare, rolling back environmental regulations, and standing in the way of wage growth for hard working Americans. Luckily, Democrats are working for the people, and offering a better deal to restore faith in government by safeguarding the right to vote, ending the revolving-door in Washington that give lobbyists and big-money donors so much influence, and putting a stop to the river of undisclosed political contributions flowing through Washington.  SUPPORTING RHODE ISLAND’S TRAVEL & TOURISM INDUSTRY   Yesterday, I sat down for a roundtable discussion with Congressman Jim Langevin and leaders in the tourism industry to discuss the obstacles and opportunities facing this vital part of our economy.  Tourism is incredibly important to Rhode Island. It supports more than 83,000 direct and indirect jobs in our state and injected more than $4.4 billion in visitor spending into our economy last year.  And, as industry leaders underscored during our discussion, one of the most important things we can do to create more good-paying jobs and support travel and tourism is invest in our infrastructure. Democrats have put forward A Better Deal to Rebuild America, which would fix our crumbling roads, bridges, ports and highways, and increase investments in our airport and rail systems. Travelers need to be able to rely on our infrastructure and transportation systems to safely get them where they need to be, on time.  SCAM PHONE CALLS   My office has heard from an increasing number of constituents that they have been receiving “scam"" phone calls – including calls that suggest you may have outstanding warrants from law enforcement or owe back taxes. As the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) advises, if you receive a phone call from someone you don’t know, and the caller or message is asking you to provide personal information – the first rule is to never provide such information, or hang up.  If you receive a call that you think may be a scam you can log a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), here. Constituents may also call 888-225-5322. You may also reach out to my office, and my staff can help guide you through the process.  IRAN SANCTIONS   President Trump shortsightedly and recklessly withdrew from the Iran Deal and now it’s clear he had no plan for what would come next. Imposing new sanctions on Iran will not stop the country from developing and using nuclear weapons and it has done nothing to advance our national security interests.  Instead, other global powers have condemned Trump’s decision. We need to be working with our international partners on a well thought out solution. This is another example of President Trump making an irresponsible decision, which jeopardizes the safety of all Americans and is a further detriment to our relationship with our allies.  SUPPORTNG RHODE ISLAND SMALL BUSINESSES   This week I met Robin, owner of the children’s boutique, Piccolo, in Barrington. Robin was able to purchase and open her store thanks to a Community Advantage loan which is part of a pilot program through the Small Business Administration. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and I’ll continue to support initiatives like the SBA Community Advantage program that help entrepreneurs like Robin compete and thrive in our economy.  As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns, please call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov.  You can also click here to follow my work on Twitter.   Warm Regards, ￼  David Cicilline Member of Congress

Dear Friend,  This week, I hosted an infant and maternal health symposium in Memphis along with Congresswoman Robin Kelly of Illinois which featured experts, advocates, and those at risk to discuss issues around infant and maternal mortality. I also received a perfect score on the Progressive Public Health and Environmental Scorecard which tracked Members of Congress’ records on issues concerning public health and the environment; met with Chastity Toler of the Step by Step Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Foundation in Memphis; talked with former Congressional office intern Janeisha Harris, Co-Founder and Chairwoman of the National Black Action Committee at Tennessee State University, and others, to review issues ranging from the state of minority businesses in Memphis to the importance of federal financial aid programs to students throughout Tennessee; and paid tribute to Charlottesville murder victim Heather Heyer on the anniversary of her death.  Keep reading to learn more about my week and follow me onTwitter and Facebook to see more updates as they happen.   Hosting a Maternal Health Symposium in Memphis Receiving a 100% Score for My Record on Public Health and The Environment Meeting with Chastity Toler and the Step by Step Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Foundation Discussing Criminal Justice Reform with Co-Founder and Chairwoman of the National Black Action Committee Meeting with Marquiepta Odom and the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) Meeting with Tennessee College Access and Success Network Signing Up for “Congress On Your Corner” and this e-Newsletter Weekly Health Tip Quote of the Week
 

 Hosting a Maternal Health Symposium in Memphis
￼  ￼ ￼   On Thursday, I hosted a symposium on infant and maternal mortality at Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church. I was pleased that Congresswoman Robin Kelly (D-Illinois) joined me as a co-host of this important event which featured health experts from across the Memphis area. Michelle Robinson McKissack, our newly elected school board member and editor of Memphis Parent Magazine, was our phenomenal moderator. Congressman Kelly and I discussed bills before the House of Representatives, including my legislation, the NEWBORN Act, that addresses America's and Memphis' high rate of infant mortality, and Congresswoman Kelly's legislation, the MOMMA Act, that addresses maternal mortality and morbidity. We discussed the needs of our community and the barriers to improving maternal health care and reducing infant mortality. Our expert panel shared their experiences as they work directly with mothers and other health care and non-traditional partners within our community. The panelists included Ajay J. Talati, M.D., professor of Pediatrics and OB/GYN at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center; Tiana Pyles, co-founder of BSTARS; Susan Helms, director if Injury Prevention and Safe Kids Mid-South; Nikia Grayson, midwife at CHOICES; Beth Shelton, lead therapist at Appleseed Inc.; and Danielle Tate, director of the high risk OB clinic at UT Regional One Physicians. We discussed resources available right here in Shelby County, such as free car seats for those in need. See my weekly health tip for more. I want to thank everyone who joined us to make this symposium a success.  
 Receiving a 100 Percent Score for My Record on Public Health and The Environment   Also on Thursday, I was proud to be one of only of 12 lawmakers to receive a 100 percent score on a Congressional Legislative Scorecard compiled by National Nurses United, Food & Water Watch and the Progressive Democrats of America.   The scorecard tracked Members of Congress' records on issues concerning public health and the environment, and looked specifically at 5 bills: the Expanded and Improved Medicare For All Act (H.R. 676), which would ensure every person in the U.S. has quality health care; the Inclusive Prosperity Act (H.R. 1144), which would impose a small tax on Wall Street to fund public health and environmental initiatives; the Nurse Staffing Standards for Hospital Patient Safety Act (H.R. 2392), which would help nurses and hospitals ensure quality patient care; the Off Fossil Fuels for a Better Future Act (H.R. 3671), which would bring us closer to a 100 percent renewable energies future; and the WATER Act (H.R. 5609), which would provide major investment to update and improve the country’s drinking water infrastructure.  I’m a co-sponsor of all 5 of these bills, and I’ll continue to advocate for bold solutions to our most urgent public health and environmental problems.   Meeting with Chastity Toler and the Step by Step Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Foundation  ￼   On Tuesday, I met with Chastity Toler, a 1992 graduate of Melrose High School and the force behind the Step by Step Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Foundation, which is dedicated to empowering, equipping, supporting and improving the quality of life for all affected by Multiple Sclerosis. When Chastity needed support, she found the closest group was in Nashville and so she created her foundation, which can be reached at SBSMSA@Outlook.com. Her work is inspiring many in Memphis to face their health problems with determined courage.   Discussing Criminal Justice Reform with Co-Founder and Chairwoman of the National Black Action Committee 
Also on Tuesday, I was pleased to welcome back to my office our former intern Janeisha Harris, who is now the Co-Founder and Chairwoman of the National Black Action Committee at Tennessee State University. We discussed criminal justice reform measures I support as a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, and I appreciated the opportunity to hear her perspective on a variety of issues as a young woman on a college campus.    Meeting with Marquiepta Odom and the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA)  ￼ ￼   On Wednesday I had the opportunity to speak with Marquiepta Odom, Associate Executive Program Director for the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) of Greater Memphis, and other YWCA representatives. The meeting dealt largely with the YWCA's funding needs and its plan to increase the capacity of its domestic violence shelter from 44 to 78 beds by the end of September. It's always valuable to talk over issues with those so deeply involved with them locally. I appreciate the work the YWCA is doing to help those affected by domestic violence.   Meeting with Tennessee College Access and Success Network   On Tuesday, I also met with Kate Watts of the Tennessee College Access and Success Network to discuss the importance of federal investment in education. We talked about ways to make it easier for first-time college students to get access to higher education. Ms. Watts also presented evidence from a study in Davidson County that the Tennessee Promise Scholarship is in effect plundering the resources of the Tennessee Hope Scholarship to the detriment of many students in need of help. The evidence indicates the lowest income students get the least amount of assistance yet are most likely to advance while the highest income level Promise students get the most money but are less likely to advance. The Promise Scholarship doesn't operate as a scholarship should -- rewarding merit and meeting genuine need.   

 Signing Up for ""Congress On Your Corner"" and this e-Newsletter  ￼   I enjoy meeting regularly with constituents in the district and helping get answers for them to questions about dealing with federal agencies. If you are interested in attending one of my “Congress on Your Corner” events, you can sign up here to receive notification as soon as the next event is scheduled.  
For those who haven’t participated in a telephone town hall, it’s easy to sign up for them by using this form.  
If you would like to receive this weekly e-Newsletter, or share it with others, you can do that with this form.   Weekly Health Tip
Each week, I share a health tip in the hope of promoting a healthy lifestyle for residents of the 9th Congressional District. As always, it is best to check with your doctor before making any changes to your diet, exercise routine or lifestyle.
The Shelby County Health Department provides free child safety seats to eligible county residents. Eligibility criteria include the baby's birth certificate, the recipent must be enrolled in TNCare, SNAP or WIC programs; and the recipient must have a valid Tennessee driver license or state I.D. Appointments are required (call 901-222-9276) and distribution is limited to 1:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Another tip this week stems from my meeting with Chastity Toler and the Step by Step Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Foundation. MS is a terrible illness but important work at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke is making advances in its treatment. See details here.   Quote of the Week
Sunday will be the first anniversary of the death of Heather Heyer, the 32-year-old Charlottesville, Virginia, paralegal protesting the neo-Nazi and white supremacists rally who was run down and killed. The same organizer of that backward movement plans another protest outside the White House on Sunday. I hope all my constituents will pay tribute to Heather's bravery and the cause for which she gave her life and remember, too, that the President of the United States said that there were ""some very fine people on both sides."" I am a cosponsor of the National Opposition to Hate, Assault and Treats to Equality (NO HATE) Act (H.R.1566).    As always, I remain, 
Most sincerely,
￼

August 10, 2018 
Dear Friend,  Yesterday, I held a field hearing in Sacramento as Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials on the skyrocketing costs and rampant mismanagement of the California High Speed Rail project. This was the fourth hearing I’ve held on the high speed rail project since becoming chairman of the subcommittee, and it’s the fourth hearing at which we have discussed higher costs for the project.  The Authority’s confusing business plans are not grounded in reality, and their continued disregard of facts on the ground have lead and will continue to lead to skyrocketing costs and public outrage. This project is becoming the poster child for mismanagement and it runs the risk of diminishing public perception of much needed passenger rail projects nationwide. This is one of the reasons why I requested a federal audit from U.S. Department of Transportation Inspector General Calvin Scovell, who testified yesterday.  We have many problems facing California – including recovering from one of the worst droughts the state has ever seen. For a fraction of the estimated cost of this rail project, we could have built long-term sustainable water storage for the entire Valley. In a state grappling with a lack of adequate water infrastructure, it’s unfortunate that Sacramento doesn’t have the same political commitment to providing a reliable water supply to California as it does to funding a bullet train that has not, is not, and will never deliver on the promises that were made to voters. 
I visited our southern border Congress must take action to secure our border, keep families together and pass a permanent solution for America’s Dreamers – and we have to act now. It’s critical members of Congress like me visit the border and see the problems and restrictions that law enforcement is facing due to our outdated immigration laws.  Earlier this week I visited our state’s border with Mexico along with Reps. Rodney Davis (R-IL) and David Valadao (R-CA). Together we visited a detention center, port of entry, U.S. Border Patrol station, U.S. Naval Air Station and tunnel site and also reviewed our current border infrastructure and border wall prototypes. We also received multiple briefings from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (USCBP) officials on border technology, canine utilization, and inspection procedures, and discussed potential threats to our Border Infrastructure System. I’ve been on the frontlines of the immigration debate in Congress over the past few months, and I will continue to push for bipartisan legislation to improve our border security and secure a permanent solution for America’s Dreamers, as well as for legislation to put an end to family separation. 
￼ 
Recognizing Assyrian Martyr’s Day  This week I attended a local event in Modesto recognizing Assyrian Martyr’s Day (August 7) and also submitted a statement to the Congressional Record. The Valley is home to many Assyrians and this day is an important event to many in our community. Sadly, it marks the anniversary of a tragedy - the day the Iraqi army entered Simele, Iraq, and its surrounding areas and massacred thousands of men, women, and children. We also recognize the 103rd anniversary of the Ottoman genocide against the Assyrians and others that began in 1915. I will continue pushing for global recognition of this genocide. Here is an excerpt from the Congressional Record I submitted: “Despite tragedies of the past, the Assyrian people have shown an unparalleled resolve to build a better and brighter future. Earlier this year, I introduced the Nineveh Plain Restoration Act in Congress to support the swift rehabilitation of the Nineveh Plain in the wake of war and violence. We must ensu! re Assyrians have a home and a future in their ancestral homeland, and I will continue to prioritize this. Although we cannot change the past, I look forward to working with those in my community to build a strong and vibrant future for Assyrians here in America and around the world.”  Thank-a-Vet Thursday: Howard Haak  I recently released my August Thank-a-Vet Thursday video featuring Howard Haak, a 99-year-old Army veteran who served during World War II. Howard was drafted into the Army in October of 1941. He went on to serve 15 years in the military as a radio repairman, including tours in England, Africa, France and Italy, where he was stationed when the first bomb dropped on Hiroshima. In the video, Howard recounts training to become a radio repairman and working on the equipment that first detected Japanese planes flying towards Pearl Harbor. For his service, Howard was awarded the American Area Campaign Medal and World War II Victory Medal. Thank you, Howard, for your service. Watch the video here.

Week in Review
Hello Friends, 

Another hot week in the books for Arizona!

This week, I had the pleasure to meet with constituent groups on a variety of issues as well as a non profit working towards helping homeless Arizonans gain more stability in their lives. We had the chance to discuss issues stemming from healthcare to real estate, mortgages, and veterans. These groups are always providing new ideas on how to make Arizona a great place and I appreciate their time on these important issues.

If your group is interested in setting up a meeting with me or any experts in my office please email:

August Letter to Health & Human Services
I joined my fellow Arizona Members Martha McSally, Debbie Lesko, Andy Biggs, Kyrsten Sinema, and Tom O’Halleran in sending a letter to the Inspector General and Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement demanding there be an investigation to look into the sexual abuse allegations at the Southwest Key facility in Arizona.
The letter asks thorough questions related to all of the allegations of sexual and physical abuse at federal funded shelters which housed underage minors. I find that being the father of a two and a half year-old, the types of allegations being reported terrify me down to my bones. Now we are going to take action to find out what has really been going on.
To read the content of the letter, follow this link to my website.   
In Case You Missed It
This July I led the charge on a bill that would establish an electronic standard for prior authorizations in Medicare. H.R. 4841 would help move pharmacies and doctors away from faxing the prior authorization forms and encourage them to communicate in real time through electronic means.
The bill consists of two main ideas: to prevent the delays caused by the current system of non-electronic/real time prior authorization requests so that Medicare patients receive prescriptions as soon as possible, and by making the process electronic, there will be an improved oversight in the system to ensure patients are only receiving approved medications.
Medicare has very high rates of opioid abuse. Nearly 1/3 of individuals enrolled in Medicare’s prescription drug benefit (Part D) in 2017 received a prescription opioid, and HHS/OIG has identified high rates of abuse within this population. These changes will improve oversight in opioid prescribing to ensure only those individuals prescribed are receiving the medically necessary medications.    For more information, follow this link.

The Hill Report   A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions Week of August 6 - August 10, 2018
As Co-Chairman of the Semiconductor Caucus, it has been my goal to ensure Texas companies that rely on semiconductor equipment and materials, like Texas Instruments, have their voices heard here in Congress. This is why I am disappointed that the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) has chosen to include semiconductors in their sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports after I, and nearly 50 of my colleagues, expressed our concern that including semiconductor and semiconductor equipment would negatively impact American innovators and have zero impact on Chinese companies, completely failing to accomplish the goal of these tariffs. I have had numerous meetings with the Trade Ambassador on this specific topic and will continue to work to find more targeted and effective strategies that do not jeopardize the future of American workers and put our economic prosperity in harms-way. 
Read more on my letter to USTR Ambassador Robert Lighthizer urging the Administration to remove semiconductor, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and related products from the 301 tariff action here. 
Dallas VA I had a productive discussion with Dallas VA leadership on critical efforts to prevent veteran suicide and how we can continue working together to support our North Texas veteran community. The men and women who have served our nation selflessly deserve access to the best possible care, including lifesaving mental health care. Here in Dallas, our VA is leading the way in providing this critical support and I appreciated receiving an update on their efforts. 
￼  Congressman Sessions with leaders of the Dallas VA. 
Rare Disease Legislative Advocates This week, I was happy to meet with Rare Disease Legislative Advocates in Dallas, to discuss my long-standing support of medical research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). I have consistently supported funding research for cures to diseases, especially crippling rare diseases, affecting folks across our country. I also continuously engage my colleagues in Washington, most recently by bringing in Dr. Francis Collins the director of the NIH, so they understand the critical nature of the research being done. As the father of a son with a disability, I know firsthand the importance of medical research and improving the quality of life for all Americans. 
￼

ALS Society On Friday, I met with the Regional Director of the ALS Society of North Texas, Catherine Nodurft, to hear more about efforts to find a cure to this debilitating disease and their advocacy on behalf of those who suffer from ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease. Through the work being done at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and researchers across the country, including here in North Texas, I am hopeful we will see a cure in the future. My colleagues and I in Congress must do everything we can to support researchers and physicians by removing roadblocks and cutting the red-tape that inhibits critical research and new treatments that could one day lead to a cure.

New Beginnings 


￼
 Today, we celebrated the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Salesforce Transit Center, a revolutionary infrastructure initiative worthy of America’s cradle of innovation. This 21st century transit hub will not only curb congestion and cut down commutes, it will transform how our city works, travels and lives. The Center is about so much more than transportation — it is about community. 
  
￼ 
Congresswoman Pelosi joined Mayors London Breed, Willie Brown, local officials, and community members to celebrate the opening of the new Salesforce Transit Center. 
The Transit Center connects our city with vibrant public spaces where all can gather, play and thrive, together. It brings beauty and art to our neighborhoods. It gets people out of their cars, reducing emissions and safeguarding clean air and clean water for generations to come. And it moves us forward – together.
When I was Speaker, House Democrats passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act one week and one day after President Obama’s inauguration, which provided a critical $400 million investment to launch this nationally significant project, creating tens of thousands of good-paying local jobs and improving quality of life for the Bay Area.
We must continue to bring better infrastructure to our beloved city and to communities across the country. Democrats have A Better Deal to Rebuild America For The People that means investing $1 trillion and creating more than 16 million new good-paying American jobs.  Our dynamic city must continue to lead the way forward, as we deliver these transformational investments in America’s infrastructure. 
California Wildfires 
As a Californian and an American, I am heartbroken by the devastation of the wildfires across California. Our hearts are with the loved ones of the ten people whose lives were cruelly cut short by the fires, and all those whose lives have been upended by this disaster.
We are all immensely grateful to the tens of thousands of firefighters and first responders from California, other states and other countries currently risking their lives and safety to battle wildfires throughout our state.  Our firefighters are our nobility, and their courage on the frontlines of these blazes is an act of profound heroism.
The Administration’s Major Disaster Declaration for Shasta County takes an important first step to combat this disaster, but the President must expand this declaration to the other counties ravaged by wildfires, as Governor Brown has requested.  The Administration also must start taking real, urgent action to combat the threat of the climate crisis, which is making the wildfire season longer, more expensive and more destructive. 
The country stands in solidarity with the families and communities devastated by this disaster, and we pledge to work tirelessly to help Californians heal, recover and rebuild.

A constituent contacted my office to discuss his problem with the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (SFVAMC) regarding a bill that he believed he was wrongly charged for. He informed my office that he should not be obligated to pay for the services rendered to him by the SFVAMC because he was receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI). This bill would have imposed an enormous financial burden upon him because he is a low-income individual, and his SSI benefits would have been reduced to pay for these services.  After my office reached out to the SFVAMC, they determined that he was without fault. The SFVAMC found that he was wrongly billed for the services he received after reviewing his eligibility under SSI.

Dear Friends, 
Before I returned home for the district work period, I had the honor of being named as one of the twenty-nine conferees for the 2018 Farm Bill. With the House and Senate passing their versions of this legislation, conferees are chosen from the House and Senate to come together and iron out differences between the two bills. I sat down with the House Agriculture Committee and shared my thoughts on the upcoming conference (see video below). 
Representing the farmers and ranchers of our district and the great state of Florida is a privilege I do not take lightly. We have a unique opportunity to provide certainty and security to the hard-working families who put food on our table every day. I have been around agriculture most of my life, and I will always fight for those who work in acres not hours. 
Sincerely, 
Ted

Dear Lindsey, 
On Monday, I had the opportunity to tour and meet with staff at Mid-State Health Center in Bristol, which offers primary care, behavioral health care, laboratory services, and dental and pharmacy services. I was proud to help Mid-State apply for funds through the Department of Agriculture Office of Rural Development to build their Bristol location, and I will continue working to ensure every Granite Stater has access to community health centers and the care they need.

Investing in Potential of New Hampshire Communities 
It was wonderful to speak with Franklin City Manager Judie Milner and city economic development workers on Monday afternoon and to see firsthand the progress the city has made in rejuvenating its downtown. I helped Franklin with its recent successful grant application for technical assistance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Office of Rural Development because I believe in the potential of Franklin and every Granite State community. I look forward to seeing Franklin’s continued development and I will keep working to ensure every New Hampshire town has access to the funds they need to expand, improve, and create an environment where people can thrive.

Expanding Access to Quality, Affordable Housing 
On Wednesday, I took part in the groundbreaking of Tracy Community Housing in West Lebanon, which will be 29 units of affordable rental housing and the first net-zero multi-family building, either affordable or market-rate, in New Hampshire. Affordable housing like this is a lifeline that helps care for the elderly and the most vulnerable in our communities and it is a critical link to our economic vitality. I will continue my efforts to expand our affordable housing stock so that every Granite Stater has access to a quality home.
￼
At the groundbreaking of Tracy Community Housing
Taking a Thoughtful Approach to Trade 
I also met with company officials at Hypertherm in Lebanon on Wednesday and heard directly from them about the impact of President Trumps’ tariffs on local businesses. Contrary to what President Trump has said, there are no winners when countries engage in a reciprocal tariff battle. International trade is an increasingly important way for businesses in New Hampshire like Hypertherm to reach new consumers, grow their operations, and create jobs. I appreciate the opportunity to hear from Granite Staters who are on the frontlines of this trade war, and I urge the president to exercise a more thoughtful approach to trade and focus on how the United States can work with our allies to achieve our common goals. The long-term success of New Hampshire’s workforce and economy rely on it.
Ensuring Veterans Have Access to Excellent Care and Services 
On Thursday, Senator Shaheen, Senator Hassan, Congresswoman Shea-Porter and I wrote to Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie urging him to quickly implement the recommendations made in June by a task force to improve the Manchester VA Medical Center. Many of the recommendations reflect priorities we have long supported, such as improving mental health and management services to prevent substance misuse, expanding access to telehealth care, creating a comprehensive ambulatory surgical care center, strengthening ties between the Manchester VA and nearby medical schools and other institutions of higher education, and expanding services for women veterans. After everything they have been through, New Hampshire’s veterans deserve nothing less than excellent care and services, and the key now will be ensuring that these recommendations are quickly and effectively implemented.
If you ever have a question, concern or idea you would like to bring to my attention, please don’t hesitate to reach out to my Washington, DC office at 202-225-5206 or my Concord office at 603-226-1002.

Congressman Courtney meeting with his Veterans Advisory Board in his Norwich Office on Monday
DVA Commissioner Tom Saadi Joins Veterans Advisory Board Meeting
This week, I hosted Connecticut’s Department of Veterans Affairs Commissioner Tom Saadi for my monthly veterans’ advisory board meeting. We were joined by over twenty veteran-related groups and agencies to discuss several topics including my recent letter to the Secretary of Defense, General Mattis. This letter was signed by 83 members of Congress calling on the Department of Defense to abandon plans to restrict active duty service members ability to transfer Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits. The Pentagon’s proposal would prevent service members with more than 16 years of service from transferring their education benefits to eligible family members. We also covered my new bill, the Agent Orange Exposure Fairness Act that would modify the time restriction for reporting diseases related to Agent Orange and add an additional disease to the list for coverage.
Commissioner Saadi offered an update from the State Department of Veterans Affairs and discussed legislative efforts to address the definition of a veteran in Connecticut. He also addressed several inquiries and concerns from the group on the Rocky Hill veterans’ facility and its conversion from a chronic disease center to a skilled nursing facility. All in all, a very productive meeting. A special thanks to all who participated.

I received an update from Electric Boat on the next submarine under construction, the USS Vermont on Monday afternoon. Once again, the men and women at EB are working around the clock to meet their deadline and make sure this boat is ready for its schedule christening in October. 
Tanner Giants invited me a couple of months ago to see the great progress being made on ther Vermont and he did a great job explaining the new features of this amazing vessel. Tanner is a great example of an up and coming leader at the shipyard.

Congressman Courtney, EPA New England Regional Administrator Alex Dunn and representatives awarding the EPA BEACH Act Grant at Hommonasett Beach State Park
A Tour of Eastern Connecticut with EPA Regional Administrator 
On Tuesday, I hosted the EPA New England Regional Administrator Alexandra Dunn in Eastern Connecticut for several site visits across the region that have utilized federal funding through her agency. We started at Hammonasett Beach State Park in Madison with a press conference to announce a $211,000 EPA Beach Act Grant for the State of Connecticut. Beach Act Grant funding supports water quality monitoring in Connecticut’s coastal water so that local and state agencies can test for bacteria and notify the public of conditions that may be unsafe for swimming. We then ventured to the Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton and met with Commander Capt. Paul Whitescarver to receive a briefing on the continued cleanup efforts at our nation’s oldest submarine base. The Navy has made great progress over the last 25 years, working with the EPA to remove hazardous material and improve water quality on the Thames River.
We also had the chance to visit Griswold Health Center and met with Jennifer Granger, CEO of United Community and Family Services, and discussed the new facility and beneficial impact of utilizing the former brownfield site. The building came out beautiful. We ended our day with a visit to the former InterRoyal Mill site with Plainfield First Selectwoman Cathy Tendrich who provided us a short presentation on the status of the abandoned mill.

Congressman Courtney at the grant opening of eastern Connecticut's first Women's Business Development Council center in New London
Opening the Women’s Business Center in New London
Wednesday, I was honored to join the opening of eastern Connecticut’s first Women's Business Development Council (WBDC) center with CEO Fran Pastore on State Street in New London. The new center is supported by a $75,000 federal grant from the Small Business Administration (SBA) and is a result of a five-years of work between WBDC and my office. 
WBDC plays a critical role in our state economy through entrepreneurial development programs, counseling and training, access to capital, and women-focused networking. Since 2015, I have worked collaboratively with WBDC leadership to help open a center to serve southeastern Connecticut, including sending a letter to SBA on their behalf earlier this year. Following the establishment of Connecticut’s Women’s Business Centers in 1997, WBDC has served over 19,000 clients, helped to create 1,800 new businesses, sustained and expanded 3,800 established businesses, and supported the creation of over 4,900 jobs. The great citizens of New London and the Second Congressional District look forward to utilizing the resources of the WBDC in helping to empower women by creating new avenues to entrepreneurial success.
￼
Discussing Newsprint Tariffs with the Norwich Bulletin
This week I had the opportunity to meet with several organizations across our region that have been impacted by President Trump’s tariffs on trade. Among the eastern Connecticut organizations footing the bill for these tariffs are our local newspapers, including the Norwich Bulletin, who purchase their newsprint from Canadian mills. The recently reduced tariff cap still taxes newsprint imports at a hefty 16.88%, driving up the cost for American print news outlets. For eastern Connecticut papers, the tariff translates to an increased cost in the six-figure range, which directly impacts jobs, and the ability for their papers to cover the news. Not only is this an economic issue, but the threat to newspapers that these tariffs impose also threaten a free press, which is protected under the First Amendment.
There has long been a just process for bringing forward claims of unfair trade practices to the World Trade Organization, and the President’s method of throwing out tariffs ad hoc leaves American organizations and businesses eating the cost.

Congressman Courtney visiting Garbo Lobster in Groton on Thursday
Garbo Lobster in Groton Hit Hard by Trump Tariffs 
I had the chance to visit Garbo Lobster in Groton on Thursday to learn more about the impact the Trump administration tariffs are having on their business and the news is not good. While there, I met with general manager Chris Brown who said that the lobster industry has taken a big hit due to the retaliatory tariffs imposed by China after the Trump administration placed tariffs on many imported products coming from their country. He explained to me that this time last year, Garbo would be pumping out “hundreds of thousands of pounds per week” to one of the biggest lobster buyers in the world. Today their exports to China have decreased to practically zero. While many agree that there are aspects of the U.S.–China trade relationship that need to improve, particularly China’s theft of U.S. commercial intellectual property, the blunt instrument of tariffs will likely have worse consequences for small and medium business in the U.S. than in China. 
Garbo Lobster is not alone in their real worries about the future of their business due to the Trump administration’s trade policies. Tariffs are also harming other industries such as pork, dairy, lumber, newspapers that rely on newsprint paper, and many others. The Trump administration should immediately reconsider the destructive tariffs against America’s oldest allies and pursue our legitimate claims against China vigorously through the World Trade Organization (WTO) before resorting to tariffs which are hurting small and medium businesses right here in Eastern Connecticut.
￼
Congressman Courtney touring Woodstock Sustainable Farms on Friday
Visiting Local Farms In Northeast Connecticut 
On Friday morning, I joined the Connecticut Farm Bureau President Don Tuller and Executive Director Bryan Hurlburt for a farm tour throughout northeastern Connecticut. We began at Woodstock Sustainable Farms, a farm focused on regionalizing food systems and shortening food supply chains. I then visited Hull forest products in Pomfret, a 3rd generation family run sawmill and woodland management service where I received updates on how Trump Tariffs are already taking a toll.  We ended our farm tour with a visit to Lapsley Orchard, a diversified fruit and vegetable agricultural site. This 30+ year old orchard has expanded operations to include a community-supported agriculture and agri-tourism.
I hope you enjoyed this snapshot of my work, and as always thank you for taking a moment to read my weekly update. If you have any questions or concerns about the information in this newsletter, you can contact me through my website or by calling my Norwich district office at 860-886-0139.

Petition at Farmfest – Redwood County
 
Dear Friends,
 
This week, I had the opportunity to attend Farmfest. Hundreds of Minnesota’s farmers, ranchers and manufacturers traveled to the site to see the latest developments in agriculture technology, and to watch presentations from experts in the field. I also visited with constituents in Roseau and Kittson counties who are struggling with drought conditions. I have called Secretary Perdue and asked that he declare an emergency for the area. This will allow haying and grazing on CRP acres providing some relief to cattle producers with burned out pastures. 
 
Sincerely,
￼ Congressman Collin C. Peterson
Minnesota 7th District
 
Minnesota Farmfest
￼
 
I enjoyed attending Farmfest at the Gilfillan Estate near Morgan this week. For over 30 years, Farmfest has brought members of the agriculture community together to share information about the industry, and to connect with others who share their way of life. Manufacturers came to showcase new innovations in farm technology, expert speakers gave presentations on topics in agriculture, and venders shared their products and kept everyone well fed by offering a wide-range of locally produced foods.

This year, over 400 groups operated booths at Farmfest. I took the opportunity to speak with attendees and exhibitors about the issues that are affecting their work. American Farm Bureau President Kevin Paap and Minnesota Cattlemen’s Association President Mike Landuyt took advantage of this opportunity as well.

I heard again and again from farmers about their concerns with trade, and farm profitability. The trade war is sinking prices for livestock and commodities, and farm income is expected to hit a 12-year low in 2018. It is time that Congress and the Administration step up to do right by farmers by enacting a Farm Bill and pursuing trade policies that support our producers.

Between conversations with producers I took time to visit with agricultural news networks to discuss the Farm Bill and trade negotiations. If you would like to listen to one or more of my interviews, please follow any of the links below.

Drought in Northwestern Minnesota
￼
 
I met with livestock producers from Kittson and Roseau County this week to discuss the extremely dry weather they have experienced this summer. The lack of rain has contributed to the growing shortage of hay, a primary ingredient in cattle feed. A long winter, and a hot, windy summer has limited natural pasture growth, forcing farmers to start feeding hay earlier than normal. The combination of minimal pasture growth and longer hay-feeding intervals is raising concerns that hay prices will remain high throughout another Minnesota winter.
 
Senate Action Needed on Wood Heater Bill 
￼
 
Two years ago, several wood heater manufacturing companies in my district contacted me about an EPA regulation that was pushing them out of business. These manufacturers employ hundreds of rural Minnesotans and drives local economies in towns like Greenbush, Red Lake Falls, and Warroad. 
 
I introduced H.R. 453, the Relief from New Source Performance Standards Act, in early 2017 to address EPA’s overly burdensome rules on these types of companies. After a year of advocacy and Congressional committee hearings, my bill passed the House as part of a small package five months ago. I hope the Senate can move quickly so this bill can be signed into law.
 
I am proud to represent rural Minnesotans in Congress and will continue to advocate on behalf of our businesses and families. 
 
Red Lake Falls Discussion on Infrastructure
￼
 
Senator Amy Klobuchar and my staff aide LeRoy Stumpf met with Red Lake Falls officials to discuss infrastructure needs in the area. Many of Minnesota’s rural communities require large infrastructure investments for upgrades to sewer and water, and broadband internet systems. As ranking member of the House Committee on Agriculture, which oversees rural development programs, I will continue working to ensure those programs are adequately funded to help our rural communities meet their needs.
 
Yellow Rose Days with Marvin
￼
 
On Thursday, I was able to tour Marvin’s production facility in Warroad during their Yellow Rose Days festivities. Marvin’s Warroad factory houses more than 2 million square feet of manufacturing space and is the location where they produce many of their best-known products. I am thankful for the opportunity to tour their factory, and for the vital role they have played in the Warroad community for so many years.
 
This Week in American History
￼
 
On August 9, 1842, the Webster–Ashburton Treaty, which set the boundary between Canada and the United States, was signed by the United States and Great Britain. The boundary had been in dispute since the end of the American Revolution. Minnesota's curious Northwest Angle is a result of this treaty.
 
What’s the Story?
￼
 
George G. Marvin moved to Warroad in 1904 to take a job managing a local grain elevator. In 1912, he established the Marvin Lumber & Cedar Company to take advantage of the community’s booming lumber industry. George became well known in Warroad for his business management skills and his willingness to lend a helping hand during times of economic hardship. Following World War II, George’s son William launched what we know today as Marvin Windows and Doors – offering jobs to veterans returning from battle. Marvin has grown to employ more than 4,000 people today, many of them in Minnesota. This miniature Marvin semi-truck is displayed in my Washington, D.C. office.

Dear Friend,  My job is to help solve problems for Arizona families. Too many Arizonans still struggle with the high cost of health care or with getting the training they need for good-paying jobs. That’s why this week I hosted a health care roundtable with local doctors and patient advocates to find solutions that lower costs and protect care for Arizona families. I also continued our Jobs Tour, listening to Arizona businesses and workers about how we can create more opportunity right here in Arizona.  At the health care roundtable, I sat down with doctors, patient advocates, and other Arizona health leaders. We discussed the importance of continuing to fix what’s broken in our health care system while protecting what's working. That means defending coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, supporting AHCCCS - Arizona’s Medicaid program - and Medicare, and protecting older Arizonans from an “age tax” on their health care. We’ll keep working to lower costs and improve access so everyday Arizonans can get the affordable, quality care they need. 
￼     ￼
I also continued our Jobs Tour, hearing from electrical instructors and staff at the Phoenix Electrical Joint Apprenticeship Training Center (JATC).  We discussed the need to cut through dysfunction in Washington to make sure Arizonans get the skills to compete in today’s economy. Everyday Arizonans need good-paying jobs to get ahead, and our companies need a skilled workforce to succeed. We will keep working with the Phoenix Electrical JATC and other technical training programs to ensure Arizonans can learn the skills they need to build better lives for themselves and their families. 
￼

I am honored to serve in Congress on behalf of Arizona families like yours. Staying in touch and listening to your questions and concerns helps inform our work. Together, we are cutting through Washington dysfunction to get things done for our state.
If there is an issue that concerns you, please let us know by clicking this link or by calling our Phoenix office: 602-956-2285. Be sure to stay connected through our Facebook and Twitter accounts, and let us know how we can be of service.
Sincerely,
￼

￼

Congratulations, Col. Sablan. Col. Esther Sablan, daughter of Saipan, was recently named the first female wing commander of the New Mexico Air National Guard’s 150th Special Operations Wing. Col. Sablan was promoted to Colonel in January, choosing to hold her promotion ceremony in the congressional office in Washington, which was truly an honor. Col. Sablan served multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan as a combat search and rescue pilot. In her new post with the 150th, she will oversee their current missions which include flight training, aircraft maintenance, intelligence targeting and combat and medical support. Congratulations, Col. Sablan, on your new leadership role as you continue to make the Marianas proud. 
￼

Tuna catch limits to support fisheries

Bigeye tuna catch limits and sale allocations for the Marianas proposed by the National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS) this week are identical to those implemented by the federal agency on an annual basis since 2014. Once again, NMFS proposes a 2,000 metric ton limit for longline-caught bigeye tuna and authorizes the Commonwealth to sell up to half that amount to U.S. longline fishing vessels based in other U.S. territories or Hawaii. Proceeds from the sale of the are to fund fisheries development projects that are included in the Marianas Marine Conservation Plan. 
￼

Fighting for cleaner air

Public health is negatively impacted by high levels of hazardous air pollution from vehicle emissions and I want to keep our island air clean and our people healthy. But the Trump Administration is seeking to weaken federal clean car standards covering emissions and fuel economy for model year 2021-2026 light duty vehicles. This week I joined 57 of my colleagues in the Congressional Tri-Caucus in a letter to the EPA Administrator and the Secretary of Transportation about our deep concern with the proposals that would disproportionately impact low-income communities and communities of color. Our letter urges the Administration to engage with state, territorial and federal stakeholders to establish strong clean car standards for the next decade. The Center of Disease Control and Prevention has said that “economically disadvantaged and minority populations share a disproportionate burden of air pollution exposure and risk”.  
￼

Student training funds in Perkins Act

Annual training funding of $350,000 to the Marianas for our students to get the skills that match in-demand jobs in our local economy will continue to be authorized with enactment of Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21s Century Act. The law reauthorizes the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, which has provided annual funding to the Public School System under the main federal career and technical education programs. PSS uses the money to provide classroom instruction and on-the-job training to about 1,200 students. The CTE-funded programs available include hospitality and tourism, construction, electronics, basic automotive and engine repair, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning. 
￼

New Medicare cards out

Marianas Medicare patients should have received their new Medicare cards in the mail, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services mailing schedule. The new cards will now battle fraud by giving you a unique, randomly-assigned Medicare number and will no longer display individual's Social Security numbers. Once you receive your new card, you’re asked to destroy your old card and keep your new card number confidential. If you have not received your new card, please call your congressional office at 670-323-2647. 
￼
￼

Welcome, STEP-UP. Marianas students were in Washington, DC this week to participate in the STEP-UP program, funded by the National Institute of Health. Pictured here in their lab coats are -- clockwise -- Britney Takai (Kagman High School), Natalie Montano (Saipan Southern High School), Tina Choi (Marianas Baptist Academy), Jeni Costales (Rota High School), and De Faustina Camacho (Kagman High School). They visited their congressional office on Wednesday with chaperones Asap Ogumoro from the CNMI Public School System Science Program and Rota High School teacher Chanelle Manglona. Four-year-old Luke Sablan tagged along with his mother Mary Ann Sablan (not in photo), who was showing the group around the DC area. Thank you, all, for visiting.

WEEK IN REVIEW
￼
To start off this week's From the Front... I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nation’s capital, including Kathryn Davidson of Springdale, James Smithson of Springdale, Kaleb and Gregory Kassaw from Russellville, members of the 188th Force Support Squadron, and the Walker family from Fayetteville. Safe travels back to the Natural State.
This week, I had the opportunity to meet with many friends across Northwest Arkansas. On Tuesday, I spoke at the Rogers Noon Rotary Club as they presented the Dick Daniel Distinguished Citizen Award to Dick Barclay of Rogers. Dick dedicated his life as a public servant of Benton County. Dick was a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives, co-sponsor of legislation that created Northwest Arkansas Community College, and a member of the Arkansas Society of Certified Public Accountants and of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. I was honored to present Dick with this award. Thank you, Dick, for your commitment and dedication to our community.
￼
On Wednesday, I attended the 50th Anniversary of the Association of Arkansas Counties Conference. This conference highlights the importance for counties to come together and solve issues as a unified group to better serve our communities and the Natural State. I spoke to the conference on the topic of e-fairness. Earlier this June, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled for the state of South Dakota in the case South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. The decision upholds the state’s requirement that large-scale online sellers without a physical presence in the state collect and remit sales and use taxes. For years, I have highlighted the inherent unfairness of the Quill standard and urged Congress to be proactive in finding a commonsense solution. By overturning Quill’s outdated nexus requirement, the Supreme Court has done what Congress should have long ago – pave the way for Arkansas and 44 additional states to collect the taxes they are lawfully owed and level the playing field for our local businesses. Having championed this issue since coming to Congress, I am pleased with the Supreme Court’s decision. 
￼
I began my Thursday morning visiting Bud Anderson Heating and Air. They are the largest heating and air company in Northwest Arkansas and have recently expanded their footprint to include plumbing and electrical services. I enjoyed my time talking with the employees about the recent expansion and updated them on the recent issues surrounding trade and tariffs. After my visit with Bud Anderson Heating and Air, I met with members of the Springdale Kiwanis Club. I gave them an update on the happenings in Congress and legislation relevant to the Third District. Thank you for letting me stop by!   
To wrap up my week, I toured Sharps Quarry in Springdale, where I met with the employees and discussed securing a long-term fix for the highway trust fund. Last month, the Appropriations Committee passed the Fiscal Year 2019 Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development bill out of committee and sent the bill to the floor. This bill allows $46 billion from the Highway Trust Fund to be spent on the Federal-aid Highways Program. This funding, if passed by the whole of the House and Senate, will benefit companies like Sharps Quarry.
Remember to keep an eye on my website or check out my Twitter and Instagram pages to stay up-to-date with the latest news from the Third District and Washington. 
POLICY UPDATE: 
As Vice Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I have a direct hand in guiding taxpayer dollars to the most effective health care programs, including research through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and for various programs that increase access to care. It is the work of the Appropriations Committee to make sure that your tax dollars are used on important programs that deliver to the people of Northwest Arkansas.
Recently, the House Appropriations Committee passed additional funding for NIH, which includes research funding to find cures for cancer and Alzheimer’s. These are important investments to make, and NIH has made significant strides in treatments for some of the worst diseases. This bill also included funding for important rural health programs that Arkansans use every day. I was proud to support this legislation so we can find a cure to cancer.
I also strongly believe that Obamacare is failing, and we must fix our health care system. Health care decisions must be between a patient and their doctor, and there is no room for a Washington bureaucrat in these decisions. I have previously voted and worked to replace the failing Obamacare and will continue to work with my colleagues to find solutions that bring down the cost of premiums and increase access to care. Recently, the Trump Administration proposed two new endeavors that would expand coverage. The first one expands the use of Short Term Insurance, which would allow people to get coverage for the short term at a lesser cost than other health insurance plans. The Administration also proposed expanding Association Health Plans, which allow small businesses and those who are self-employed to come together and purchase health insurance to bring down premium costs for all those in the plan.
Ensuring that Arkansans have access to health care and that your taxpayer dollars are being responsible used is a top priority. I work closely with my colleagues to invest in programs that are making a difference and will help those who need it. I also know that we can do better than Obamacare and will work to make sure that the patient and doctor relationship is strengthened.

Discussing the Economy, Tariffs, and Prescription Drug Prices on Fox Business
I appeared on Fox Business with Maria Bartiromo this week to discuss the economy and the impact tariffs are having on businesses in Upstate New York. I’ve met with business owners and their employees across our district who are concerned that tariffs could make raw materials, such as metals and agriculture products, more expensive and hurt their businesses. 
China should face penalties for their widespread violation of US company intellectual property,, but I remain concerned about the broader impact of these tariffs and the unintended consequences of a trade war. Watch the interview to hear more, including discussion about the administration’s plan to lower prescription drug prices: http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/5819512743001/. 

America Re-implements Economic Sanctions on World’s Largest State Sponsor of Terrorism
The administration was correct in re-implementing economic sanctions against the Iranian government. The Iranian regime's continued support of international terrorism, development of intercontinental ballistic missiles, and threats against our ally Israel demand maximum pressure from the United States. Until Tehran ceases its destabilizing activities, the United States government should enforce strong economic sanctions.
Read more about this round of sanctions and what it will mean going forward: https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/03/trumps-1st-round-of-iran-sanctions-sends-message-this-is-not-a-test.html

American Farm Bureau Launches New Dairy Revenue Protection Insurance Plan
The Farm Bureau announced this week that they would be offering a new dairy insurance plan adopted earlier this year in Congres to help local dairy farmers during sudden drops in milk sales.  The new program will be known as Dairy Revenue Protection and will be open for sign-up on Tuesday, October 9, 2018. Coverage will begin during the first quarter of 2019.
From New York Farm Bureau President David Fisher: ""American Farm Bureau Federation's new Dairy Revenue Protection Insurance is another important risk management tool to help dairy farms weather this depressed farm economy. The program will address overall revenue needs and help protect farmers from unexpected declines in milk prices. The program would have not been possible without the federal support from Congress and Rep. John Faso.”
This new risk management tool will allow dairy farmers to expand their farm’s safety net. Producers who are interested in purchasing this product must go through a crop insurance agent. A list of these agents can be found at USDA Service Centers or online at https://www.rma.usda.gov/tools/agent.html.
This is another useful tool in the toolbox for our local dairy farmers who have seen their livelihoods put at risk due to falling milk consumption, unfair trade practices, and alternative products that masquerade as “milk”. I commend the Farm Bureau’s commitment to dairy farmers and look forward to continuing to work with them to improve the economic climate for our local farmers.

Annual Toys for Tots Train at Risk of Ending
This week, I joined my colleagues, Representatives Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and Paul Tonko (D-NY), in urging Amtrak to reverse its decision to end the Toys for Tots Train. The train is entering its 20th season of operation. Each year, the train collects over 25,000 donated toys for the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve Toys for Tots Foundation to redistribute them to underprivileged children.
The letter we sent to Amtrak’s CEO reads in part: “This is a beloved and endearing resource that many of our region’s neediest families rely on. Discontinuing this train service will mean approximately 40,000 children and their families will not benefit from donated gifts and much needed winter hats and gloves. We implore you to reconsider.
“We are aware that Amtrak has established a new policy for the operation of charter trains and believe it has every right to do so. However, ending this important holiday charter service will negatively affect the neediest in our communities and discontinue a positive charitable action that has brought great recognition to Amtrak’s reputation in the eyes of many.”
Read the full letter here, and if you don’t know about the Toys for Tots Train, click here to learn more.

Strengthening Workforce Training
Today, there are currently more jobs available than there are people unemployed, but we need to have qualified individuals to fill these positions.  The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act is a measurable improvement to workforce training efforts in America. Our economy and workforce are constantly changing. We must continue to look for ways to help train the workforce to adapt to a 21st century economy. I was proud to vote for this bill when it was before the House for full consideration.
Read more on how this legislation impacts training for the skilled contractors who help build our nation’s homes: http://rew-online.com/2018/08/08/contractors-applaud-plan-address-skilled-worker-shortage/

Lyme Disease Now Diagnosed in each of the 50 states
Lyme Disease is particularly prevalent in Upstate New York and the rest of the northeast. However, cases have begun being diagnosed across the country, and now, every state in the nation has had an occurrence of the disease.
The rise of Lyme Disease across the country requires a national strategy focused on education, prevention and a multi-pronged approach to combat the disease. It is for these reasons I joined my colleagues in introducing legislation to establish a new approach to strengthen our ability to both prevent and treat Lyme: https://bit.ly/2ONyX9N.
Read more about Lyme disease’s spread across the United States in the Washington Post: https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/the-big-number-lyme-disease-is-now-in-100-percent-of-the-us/2018/08/03/d35768ec-965e-11e8-810c-5fa705927d54_story.html?utm_term=.353594b07178

CDC Adds New Toolkit to Resources for Tickborne Related Diseases
Tick-borne related illnesses are on the rise across the country, and the Health and Human Services Department along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have displayed their commitment to combating these increasingly prevalent diseases. A crucial part of successfully combating these conditions is increased public awareness and education. The CDC’s resources will be key educational tools for on-the-ground stakeholders.

Guide on how to remove ticks safely: https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/removing_a_tick.html
Common symptoms of Tickborne illnesses: https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/symptoms.html
Geographic distribution of ticks that bite humans: https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/geographic_distribution.html
The CDC released a brand new tick-borne related illness toolkit. The new toolkit addresses Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and adds to the CDC’s available resources for various tick-borne related illnesses. The emerging focus on tick-borne related illnesses comes following a May 2018 Vital Signs report from the CDC that showed disease cases from ticks more than doubled between 2004 and 2016. 

Delaware Watershed Conservation Grant Application Process Opens
This week, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) announced the opening of a grant process to award funding dedicated to implementing conservation activities to protect the Delaware Watershed. The funds come from the Delaware Watershed Conservation Fund, which is a competitive grant program committed to supporting the protection, restoration, and conservation of fish and wildlife habitats in the Delaware River Watershed.
The Delaware River Basin is a critical natural resource for Upstate New York, and I am committed to doing what I can to contribute to its conservation and restoration. In Congress, I’ve supported the implementation of the Delaware River Basin Restoration Program the past two years, in addition to advocating for this funding. This program will go a long way toward ensuring our most precious natural resources and drinking water are clean and safe for Upstate families.
Applications for the grants are due on September 27, 2018. More information on the grants is available here: http://www.nfwf.org/delaware/Pages/home.aspx.

REMINDER: Veterans Resource Fair at the Schoharie Co. Sunshine Fair
On Saturday August 11th, I’ll be hosting a Veterans' Resource Fair at the Schoharie County Sunshine Fair at noon. The event will last until 4pm and will be located next to the Cobleskill Fire Department booth. 
Representatives from the Schoharie County Veterans' Services Office and the Stratton VA Medical Center will be in attendance to provide veterans with resources and guidance on the benefits that they have earned.
More details are available on the Facebook event page: https://www.facebook.com/events/2154797978112460/

Break the Gridlock – Promoting Problem Solving in Congress
I joined thirty-five of my colleagues in supporting the ‘Break the Gridlock’ proposal to alter rules in the House of Representatives with the goal of building consensus in solving the nation’s biggest problems. The proposed rule package would incentivize transparency and open legislative processes, along with creating debate and promoting consensus building across the aisle. 
For too long, Congress has kicked the can down the road on some of our most pressing issues, including fixing our broken immigration system, rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure, and compromising on a long-lasting healthcare system solution that truly lowers costs for consumers and improves healthcare outcomes. This package contains common-sense reforms that will incentivize transparency, compromise, and problem solving. I was happy to support the principles contained in this package.
The full Break the Gridlock package can be found here.

Train Derailment in Deposit Under Control
Yesterday, a train derailed in Deposit due to a washed out culvert as a result of heavy rains. Four locomotives derailed, and one of those locomotives fell into the river. Additionally, a couple of train cars also derailed. Fortunately, no one was injured as a result.
No hazardous materials contained in the cars spread into the river. However, diesel fuel from the locomotives leaked into the river. The National Park Service provided an update today that indicates the fuel leak has been taken care of and the minimal amount of fuel that leaked washed out of the park.   Read the update here: http://files.constantcontact.com/ec8f83f8201/cad0985a-4c21-4e64-b8d7-634c98e44bd7.pdf

Amphenol Union Picnic
I spent time at the Amphenol Union Picnic to visit with the members, retirees, and their families in attendance. Amphenol Aerospace is based out of Sidney, NY and is made up of more than 1,000 employees that play a tremendous role in supporting our national security by serving as a major component provider for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. 
The Amphenol workforce is highly skilled and technically trained, manufacturing over 200 interconnected parts that are used in the F-35. During this year’s appropriations process, I joined dozens of my colleagues in advocating for the F-35 program, which is at the forefront of our military’s technological advancement. Amphenol is leading the way in ensuring our troops have the world’s most capable tools and technology to be successful on the battlefield.

Monticello Rotary Club Monster Run
The Monticello Rotary Club hosted its 39th Annual Monster Run in Sullivan County this past weekend. All benefits from the Monster Run go to the Sullivan Veterans Coalition. The run coincided with August 5th being declared ‘Patriot’s Day’ in Sullivan County. Congratulations to Les Kristt and other organizers from Rotary for an amazing event, which attracted approximately 300 runners.
I had the opportunity to meet many of the participants and discuss what my office can do to help veterans access the benefits they have earned through their honorable service to our country. I remain committed to ensuring veterans get access to the care they need as well as making improvements to the VA to better serve our veterans.

Callicoon Center Volunteer Fire Department Pancake Breakfast
The Callicoon Center Volunteer Fire Department was established in 1914 to serve the community of the Callicoon Center Fire District and to lend aid to neighboring fire departments. I was happy to attend their Pancake Breakfast this past weekend and am grateful for all the commitment that so many have to helping their neighbors and communities.  
￼

Dutch—American Friendship Day
The Village of Kinderhook and Mayor Jim Dunham hosted a Dutch-American Friendship Day to celebrate a visit from Mayor Jan de Boer of Buren, Kinderhook’s sister community in the Netherlands – Buren. The event celebrated the life of former U.S. President Martin Van Buren, who was born and died in Columbia County. He is a descendant of Dutch settlers from Buren and was a Dutch speaker. 
I was happy to attend the ceremony and provide a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol that was raised in conjunction with the flag of Buren in Kinderhook’s Village Square.

Moving Toward a Healthier Economy Sanctions Slapped Back on Iran “US Navy's Top Admiral Cites Increased Threat in Ocean Nearest Washington.” “West Essex 1st Aid Squad Lands FEMA Grants” Salute: Bill Schluter  
Moving Toward a Healthier Economy 
After years of the “new normal” of 1 percent economic growth, this week recorded two more indications that confidence is back for American businesses and workers.
First, the latest “Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index” registered record high optimism among America’s small business owners, boosted by high cash flow and positive views of current finances. It is noteworthy that “35% of owners expect that the number of jobs at their business will increase over the next year, the second-highest reading on this measure in the history of the index.”
Read the whole story on Gallup here.
A lesser known index was also encouraging. The U.S. Department of Labor’s monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed 6.7 million “open” jobs in June. And the “quits” rate - workers voluntarily leaving jobs for new opportunities – stood at the highest in this current economic expansion.  Experts say that this shows that “job hoppers” have confidence that they can find both a new job and higher wages elsewhere.
It is pretty clear that the economy is regaining its health.  Businesses are reacting to recent policy changes, like the scrapping of numerous unnecessary and burdensome regulations.  And their confidence leads to more investment, which adds jobs and spurs growth.
Sanctions Slapped Back on Iran
The administration this week moved to re-impose certain Iranian trade sanctions that had been suspended under the 2015 nuclear agreement.  These are U.S. sanctions that have been waived for the past two and a half years but have now been “snapped back” after the Trump Administration announced its withdrawal from the Iran Nuclear Agreement in May.
This is an important development with far-reaching implications for friends and foes alike. 
	•	Iran is now prohibited once again from using U.S. dollars, the primary currency used for international financial transactions and oil purchases.
	•	Trade in metals and sales of Iranian-made cars will be banned.
	•	Permits allowing the U.S. import of Iranian carpets and food, such as pistachios, will be revoked.
	•	As are licenses that have allowed Tehran to buy U.S. and European aircraft and parts.
There is no doubt that the so-called Iran Nuclear deal was badly flawed and that for years Iran has been deceptive about its nuclear and other programs.  I would have preferred that we give our European partners some additional time to strengthen the deal. But that was not to be.
Even today, Iran asserts that it is committed to the destruction of our nation and our allies.  So we must be prepared for potential Iranian reaction.  
Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz and the energy supplies flowing through that strategic waterway - an attack on international shipping and commerce.  This week, the Iranian Navy commenced its annual military exercises in the Strait of Hormuz on Friday, with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) in charge of the operation's implementation. More than 100 Iranian ships and small vessels were assembled, a larger exercise than those in the past.
Iran is also capable of significant cyber attacks and remains the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism.
It is more clear than ever before that we have to rebuild our own military.
That is why it is imperative that Congress finalize the FY 2019 Defense Appropriations bill and send it to the President for his signature. 
To learn more about how the House-passed Defense Appropriations bill is needed to rebuild our Armed Forces, please visit.
Worth a Read: Voice of America’s story “US Navy's Top Admiral Cites Increased Threat in Ocean Nearest Washington.”  Read it here.
“West Essex 1st Aid Squad Lands FEMA Grants”
I was pleased to announce this week that the West Essex First Aid Squad will be receiving significant funding through the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program.
FEMA has awarded two grants to the West Essex First Aid Squad.  $135,282 will support the procurement of EMS equipment and $181,819 is designated for vehicle acquisition.
These critical funds will provide much needed resources to the West Essex First Aid Squad to ensure that their members can continue their critical mission of providing lifesaving aid to the residents of Caldwell, Essex Fells, Fairfield, North Caldwell and West Caldwell.  To date this year, the squad has answered over 1,500 calls.
The AFG Program supports efforts to enhance public safety by helping firefighters and emergency medical responders obtain critically needed equipment, protective gear, emergency vehicles, training and other resources. Funding is provided for AFG by the Appropriations Committee, through the annual Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Appropriations bill. 
On July 25, the Committee debated and approved the FY 2019 DHS bill, which included $350 million in funding for the AFG program. 
Read Eric Kiefer’s story in the Patch here.
Salute: A fond farewell to William ""Bill"" Schluter, longtime New Jersey legislator and dedicated public servant who died this week in Pennington.  Bill served two separate stints in the legislature, from 1968 to 1974, and then again from 1987 to 2002.   I had the real pleasure of serving with Bill during my years in the State Assembly.  He was extremely conscientious and supportive of more government accountability and transparency for all state government operations out of Trenton.  He will be missed.  Read about those contributions here.

8/10/18 17:06,Rep. Grothman Newsletter- Well Deserved Relief for Our Veterans,"￼ 
  

Combat-Injured Veteran Tax Relief  
Our veterans are an integral part of society and deserve to be represented fairly and respectfully within the tax code for their service to our country. The Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act is intended to provide tax relief to veterans through a refund of taxes paid on disability severance payments.
￼ 
Military service members eligible for the tax refund under the Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act include any veteran who discontinued military service after January 17, 1991 and received a one-time disability severance payment, which, at the time, was included as income on their tax return. I support this tax refund for military service members as it provides well-deserved tax relief to soldiers who have served our country and its people.    To see if you or a loved one is eligible for this return, please visit https://www.dfas.mil/dsp_irs.html or IRS.gov for more information.

Local Business Updates
This week, I visited with the local Chamber of Commerce from two of the largest cities in the sixth district, Oshkosh and Manitowoc.

Honoring Tennessee Veterans 
On Tuesday, I joined Governor Bill Haslam, Many-Bears Grinder from the Tennessee Department of Veterans Services, and Randy Reeves, the US Department of Veterans Affairs Under Secretary, to dedicate the Tennessee State Veterans Cemetery at Parkers Crossroads. The 132-acre cemetery is located at 693 Wildersville Road and will serve more than 45,000 veterans and their families within 17 counties in West Tennessee. 
￼
We currently have two state veterans cemeteries in Knoxville, one in Nashville and one in Memphis. It was an honor to partake in the dedication of Tennessee’s fifth State Veterans Cemetery at Parkers Crossroads. There is nothing more important than fulfilling our commitment to ensure our nation’s heroes receive the honor and respect they deserve for their sacrifice to our country. Thank you to the Tennessee Veterans Services Commissioner Grinder and all those involved in the selection and construction process. I can think of no better place to pay our respects to the brave men and women who have borne the battle.

 
Holding Iran Accountable  
On Monday, President Trump announced the first round of sanctions to be re-imposed on the Iranian regime. This action comes months after the administration’s decision to withdraw from the disastrous JCPOA, better known as the Iran deal. Under this agreement, negotiated under the Obama Administration, we not only failed to hold Iran accountable, but also emboldened the largest state sponsor of terrorism. Iran has constantly been clear with their intentions to destroy America and our strongest ally in the Middle East, Israel.
￼
The first wave of sanctions will target the automotive, industrial, and economic industries, and in November additional sanctions will be placed on their trade and vast oil market. I stand by our President’s decision and believe that reinstating these tough sanctions is the right thing to do. We can longer allow this regime to threaten our national security or that of our allies. It is time to finally hold Iran accountable. 
 
I Stand With ICE 
On Monday, President Trump officially announced his intent to nominate Ronald Vitiello to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Mr. Vitiello has more than 30 years of experience in law enforcement, previously serving as United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Deputy Director, and United States Customs and Border Protection Acting Deputy Commissioner. At a time when some on the left are calling to abolish ICE and prosecute these brave men and women that put their lives on the line to protect our communities from illegal drugs, human trafficking, & gang violence, it is so important to have strong leadership in this agency. I applaud the President for nominating a strong and proven leader to this position, and encourage the Senate to act quickly in confirming Deputy Director Vitiello’s nomination. 
 
Senate Passes National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act
Last week we received great news - the Senate passed the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act. This important legislation, sponsored by Senator Hatch and Congressman Stewart, will create a national N-1-1 number for Americans facing a mental health crisis. Many of you know someone who has struggled with mental health. As a cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation, I’m so grateful that this will bring us closer to creating an easy-to-remember 3-digit national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline for those in need. The Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, which I chair, overwhelming passed this bill last month, as well as the full House of Representatives. I applaud the Senate’s swift action sending the bill to the president’s desk and look forward to it becoming the law of the land soon.

Investing in Next Generation 9-1-1 Services
Last Friday, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) issued final rules for $110 million in grants to help facilitate the transition to next generation 9-1-1 (NG-911) services. This program will help Tennessee and other states upgrade their existing equipment to better serve their citizens. Whether you’re calling for help during a natural disaster or a time of mental distress, it is critical that first responders have the tools and resources to get you the help you need as soon as possible. This has been a longstanding priority of mine, and I am thrilled that the NTIA is building off the bipartisan legislation we passed earlier this year that included measures to continue improving 911 systems across the country. 

A Winning Economy
Not that long ago, we had a stagnant economy with a flat unemployment rate. But today, thanks to the administration and Congress’ pro-growth, low tax, and deregulatory agenda, unemployment is at a near record low, job growth is on the rise, workers are seeing wage increases, and small business optimism is at an all-time high. We’ve even reached 4.1% GDP growth - a number that the previous administration didn’t think was possible! All of this is great news for Tennessee. Businesses like Tractor Supply, FedEx, Home Depot, and McKee Foods are giving out bonuses to hardworking Tennesseans, hiring more workers, and expanding their presence across our great state. Along with this administration, Republicans in Congress are delivering on our promises. As a result, Tennessee and our entire nation is stronger at home and abroad, with a booming economy, safer communities, and a revived military. I look forward to continuing to push for policies that advance economic success for Tennessee workers and families!

Long’s Short Report – The importance of expanding international opportunities for farmers everywhere  By Rep. Billy Long  For the last few decades a trend developed on the family farm nationwide. And that trend was the family no longer wanted to farm. Once kids left for college, or for whatever reason, many didn’t want to be farmers like their folks. Thankfully in the last few years that trend has reversed and many farmers’ daughters and sons are moving back home to continue the tradition. Agriculture is vital for our state and country.  President Trump has worked hard to revive our economy and promote American jobs and growth. Over the past two years, the Trump administration has worked hard in getting our agriculture industry to a state of certainty and back on the road to prosperity. By breaking down barriers and expanding opportunities in foreign markets for American agriculture, there has been success in reopening international markets for exports like beef, pork and poultry.  With more than 2 million farms covering 915 million acres, the U.S. has been the world’s leading agricultural producer for many years. Agricultural products are a source of significant exports in the U.S., they account for roughly 10 percent of our total exports. Since 1960, American agriculture exports have exceeded agriculture imports and in 2017 the U.S. exported more than $140 billion in agricultural products.  Argentina recently ended its ban on American pork, resulting from a meeting between President Trump and Argentine President Macri. Japan has ended its ban on American lamb and Idaho potatoes. Morocco has now opened its market to American poultry. And for the first time since 2003, American beef producers have access to the Chinese market. In May of last year, President Trump negotiated a deal with the European Union to decrease unnecessary inspection requirements for citrus exports while at the same time exporting beef to Brazil for the first time in 13 years. The U.S. has also expanded its poultry exports to Guatemala, increased rice access in Nicaragua and Colombia and increased beef exports to Thailand.  American food producers have not been treated fairly on the international stage for years and that is starting to change. Farmers, ranchers and individuals in the agricultural community are always telling me to thank the president for his efforts fighting on their behalf. Most tell me they are willing to withstand some short-term pain for long-term gain. They feel other countries have been gaming the system for too long.  I am confident President Trump will continue his work to help the 3.2 million farmers in the U.S. With 200,000 new mouths to feed every day, there’s plenty of global demand for our agriculture and it is important that we continue to work on expanding these international opportunities. I look forward to working with the president to ensure the vitality of American agricultural.

This Week in the Office of Senator Marco Rubio 
Watch my video on the Economic Security for New Parents Act, which I unveiled with Congresswoman Ann Wagner last week. The bill creates an option for new parents to pull forward a portion of their Social Security to use for paid parental leave after the birth or adoption of a child. Watch the full video here.

One of the reasons why I decided to run for re-election in 2016 was to continue the momentum of recent years on Everglades Restoration.

The Board of County Commissioner’s has taken steps and will continue to ensure that the Kendall Parkway is not utilized to encourage additional development and that the Urban Development Boundary (UDB) remains intact.

MILITARY & VETERANS UPDATE - JULY 2018
￼
A Ceremony was held to honor fallen U.S. Service Members at Joint Base
Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii on August 1st
 
TOP STORY
On July 27th, the remains of 55 U.S. service members were returned to the United States by North Korea—the first signs of eased tensions since the armistice agreement was signed 65 years ago. Twenty-seven Korean War veterans from Montana remain unaccounted for, following the identification of Harold Haugland of Glendive last month. I have visited the demilitarized zone twice in the past year, and remain concerned by the threat from North Korea. I support the President’s efforts to resolve this multi-generational stalemate quickly and peacefully.
HONORING MONTANA’S VETERANS  On Monday, July 30th I introduced the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center Extension Act (S.3298), which reauthorizes the Vietnam Memorial Fund to raise money for the completion of an Education Center near the Vietnam Memorial Wall. This center will educate future generations and preserve the memory of those who served in and died in the Vietnam War. As chairman of the Parks Subcommittee, I will hold a hearing on this bill on August 15th.
On Tuesday, July 24th Senator Susan Collins and I introduced a bipartisan resolution to honor National Purple Heart Recognition Day. This event occurs every year on August 7th to honor our veterans who were either wounded on the battlefield or paid the ultimate sacrifice with their lives. The Senate passed this resolution unanimously the same day.
￼
Meeting Vietnam Veteran, Len Albright over Memorial Day in Bozeman
SUPPORTING THE MILITARY, VETERANS, AND THEIR FAMILIES
On Tuesday, July 10th I sent a letter to the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, General Joseph Lengyel, endorsing the Montana National Guard’s application for a Cyber Mission Assurance Team (CMAT). Cyber-attacks on United States’ critical infrastructure are the fastest rising threat to our national defense. Our National Guardsmen and women have the necessary skills and legal authority to protect vulnerabilities that our enemies target to disrupt our safety and way of life.  On Wednesday, August 1st I testified before the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee as the lead Republican cosponsor of the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act. Since 2002, U.S. Navy veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange while serving in Vietnam have been denied proper care through the VA due to a legal technicality. This critical bill corrects closes that loophole by extending a presumption of exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange to veterans who served aboard ships in the territorial waters of Vietnam. The House of Representatives unanimously an identical measure on June 25th.

This Week: Standing Up for Our Veterans   

Our veterans have demonstrated a selfless commitment to keeping our nation safe, secure, and free. We must do more to support veterans and service members in New Hampshire and across America, and that includes holding the Department of Veterans Affairs accountable. 
This week, I led a letter with the rest of the New Hampshire Congressional Delegation to the newly confirmed VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, urging him to take swift action to implement the recommendations of the VA New Hampshire Task Force. 
The New Hampshire Vision 2025 Task Force was convened to reexamine VA care in New Hampshire and make recommendations for a path forward. In the letter, we called on Secretary Wilkie to ensure that these recommendations are quickly and effectively implemented. 
The letter also urged Secretary Wilkie to focus “renewed attention to the needs of our North Country veterans,” including implementing more VA services that are co-located in rural communities and improving access for veterans who are in need of a complete range of medical treatment, but are without full VA services.
Additionally, in the letter, we formally invited Secretary Wilkie to visit New Hampshire to meet with our veterans and tour New Hampshire’s VA facilities. 
Read more about our letter here. 
This week, I also spoke out against the disturbing report from ProPublica that a group of President Trump’s personal friends from Mar-a-Lago have been significantly influencing decisions about the health care of our veterans at the VA. Leaving decisions about the health care of millions of veterans up to President Trump’s friends at Mar-a-Lago, who have no experience in the U.S. military or government, insults the sacrifices our veterans have made and threatens their care.
This troubling report suggests a lack of serious commitment from President Trump to ensuring that veterans in New Hampshire and across the country get the care that they have earned. I urge Secretary Wilkie to disregard the input of the ‘Mar-a-Lago Crowd,’ stop the practice of spending taxpayer dollars to ‘kiss the ring’ of dues-paying members of the President’s golf club, and work with those who have an actual understanding of what our veterans need to thrive in civilian life.
This week, Senator Shaheen and I announced that we have cosponsored legislation to protect Medicare and Medicaid from partisan attacks The Medicare and Medicaid Protection Act would require a supermajority (60 votes) to make major changes to these critical health care programs in the wake of repeated attempts from President Trump and Republicans in Congress to slash funding for these vital programs. 
Read more about our legislation here. 
This week, Secretary Betsy DeVos put forward her latest proposal that would put the interests of predatory for-profit colleges before those of defrauded students. To read my Facebook post, click here or see below. 
￼ 
For a refresher on how Secretary DeVos is supporting shady, for-profit colleges at the expense of our students, check out my latest Medium post. 
We can’t stop fighting for health care. Last summer, your stories and your advocacy helped fight off a Trumpcare bill that would have stripped away health care from millions of Americans. But the fight hasn't stopped -- the Trump Administration has continued its efforts to sabotage our country's health care system. Read my refresher on how here, and help me fight back by submitting your health care story here.

Georgia Receives Funding for Victim Services

On Thursday, the U.S. Attorney General announced more than $100 million will be given to our state to support victims of criminal activity and to make sure these criminals are held accountable for their actions.  
This is not a taxpayer funded grant opportunity. The funds originate from fines and fees paid by the people who actually commit the crime.

 Celebrating India's Independence
My husband, Steve, and I had the most wonderful time at the 22nd Annual Festival of India this past weekend.  
It was great to celebrate India’s independence and speak with everyone about the incredible partnership between our two countries. Never has there been a time when India and America mattered more to each other. 
We have witnessed a great increase in bilateral trade, and joint-manufacturing through technology sharing arrangements have become key milestones and a measure of speed and advancement on the path to closer U.S.-India relations.  
I am thankful for our continued partnership and the kindness shown at this great festival.

Honoring Purple Heart Heroes
This week, we commemorated the Purple Heart and those who were wounded or killed while selflessly serving our country. As Americans, we have a responsibility to the heroes and families who serve, and it is my hope that we can all come together, give thanks, and remember our women and men in the United States Armed Forces.
Mr. Heinrich F. Haegerich, Jr. served from November 1965 through July 1967 in the infantry as a ground soldier where he was wounded, earning the Purple Heart. He was in the 1st Calvary, an air mobile division at Georgia’s very own Ft. Benning, as well as the 25th Division in Hawaii.
My district office had the honor of assisting him while navigating the CHOICE program at the VA. Mr. Haegerich was able to receive the surgery he needed and deserved in March of this year. 
We’d like to thank Hank, active duty service members, and veterans for their incredible service to this country. We are proud to have you in the 6th District and to have honored all Purple Heart recipients on Purple Heart Day.

It's Time! 
Time to do what we said. Time to keep our promises. Time to fund and execute border security. 
No gimmicks. No betrayals. 
It's time to fund, build, and pay for the wall. 
The Fund and Complete the Wall Act 
￼ 
This Tuesday, I introduced the Fund and Complete the Border Wall Act to fully fund, complete, and pay for the border wall, while giving Border Patrol agents the resources they need to do their jobs. 
Even with a Republican-controlled House and Senate, we have failed to secure the funds for the border wall. In the meantime, our Border Patrol agents suffer demoralizing losses of resources and personnel. Some in Congress view border security as leverage for an amnesty deal, but that would turn a crisis into a catastrophe.  
Watch my appearance on Fox News at Night this week to understand more about this legislation.

Railroad Employee Convention
It was an honor to deliver the keynote address at Monday’s annual convention of Railroad Signalmen. The Trump administration attacks unions at every turn and it’s important that we stand together to support our working women and men. Organized labor built the middle class and helped give families a secure future. Yet the administration actively seeks to weaken unions. Just recently the Supreme Court dealt them a serious blow with its Janus v. AFSCME decision. In that case the Court ruled employees who choose not to join a union do not have to pay partial union dues although the union is still legally obligated to represent them in collective bargaining and in grievance procedures. These partial dues had been known as agency fees and represented what many people, including myself, believed to be a reasonable solution to a classic “free rider” problem.  All employees benefit from union activities, which unions must now carry on with diminished resources. This will weaken their effectiveness and jeopardizes the future of all, including loyal dues paying members. I appreciated the invitation to speak at the convention and express my support for the hard work that the railroad workers do every day.
 
Commissioner Gross
I joined Mayor Walsh, other local officials and community members to celebrate the formal swearing-in of new Boston Police Commissioner William Gross this week at Morning Star Baptist Church in Mattapan. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Commissioner Gross over the years. I know he will serve with compassion and distinction. The City of Boston will be well served by his leadership. 
College Bound Dorchester
I met with a group of students from College Bound Dorchester and they encouraged and inspired me. This program helps prepare students for higher education and the workforce by offering academic as well as emotional support. I shared my experiences as a student and talked about some of the challenges I faced as a young man. Participants talked about their own experiences and how the program has helped them with good advice and sympathetic mentorship. We had a great exchange and I appreciated the invitation to spend some time with both the students and advisors.
Fuller Village 
I participated in a community meeting yesterday with residents of Fuller Village in Milton to answer questions about the work I am doing in Washington and learn more about the issues that concern them. Fuller Village is an independent senior housing community offering a variety of supportive services – a wellness clinic, community garden, fitness center and café are all available to Fuller Village residents. We had a substantive and wide ranging exchange about a host of issues, from health care and transportation to the challenges of the Trump administration. We also talked about the difficulty of reaching compromise in Washington today and the many bad consequences of the president’s polarizing rhetoric. None of that will help resolve serious problems such as stabilizing Social Security and Medicare.
Smart from the Start
It was a pleasure yesterday to spend time with staff and participants from the Smart from the Start program at Houghton’s Pond in Milton. It is the site of one of their Address the Stress day camps. The program provides expansive services for children and adults. It offers prenatal classes and home visits for parents of newborn babies. Initiatives tailored to toddlers and preschoolers help stimulate learning and prepare children for school. The Baby Basics class presents a weekly support program for new parents and Smart from the Start also manages three summer programs that run for two weeks. All its services and classes are free to participants and Smart from the Start is now celebrating its 10th year. I learned a great deal about the overall program and its mission from talking with the Executive Director.
Behind the Curtain – More House and Trump Administration Actions You Don’t Want to Miss
Here are this week’s additions. If you need to catch up or share with friends, you can find the full list here.
341:     According to a July 2018 National Public Radio report, the U.S. Government Publishing Office (GPO) gave its biggest contract to a company called Cenveo in a manner that raises numerous red flags. Cento went bankrupt 4 months after it got the contract but the federal government will pay $5.5 million to the company according to terms of a bankruptcy settlement. The $61 million contract was for census related printing, including the form mailed to households to determine population count. The GPO’s Office of the Inspector General recently found that the federal agency failed to conduct adequate due diligence before awarding the multi-million dollar contract. Officials did not, for example, do enough research on Cenveo’s financial health, which would have revealed it was on the verge of bankruptcy. Cenveo was also permitted to lower its bid after all the other bids were known, giving them an unfair, if not illegal advantage. This is a grossly irresponsible managing of federal tax dollars and it places unnecessary pressure on the Census Bureau. At this point, they still don’t have a printer for the 2020 census forms.  
342:     According to a July 2018 Associated Press report, the Trump administration is making the dubious argument that tougher fuel standards would make it essentially more dangerous to drive. In a draft report obtained by the AP, one of the points the administration makes is that people would drive more if their vehicles got more miles per gallon so they’d be on the road more with greater opportunity to get in an accident. This is a ludicrous argument against fuel efficiency, cooked up to justify their previous decision to reject the Obama administration’s more stringent fuel standards.
343:     According to an August 2018 Politico report, the Inspector General for the Department of the Interior is investigating Ryan Zinke over plans for a microbrewery in Whitefish, Montana – his hometown. The IG is looking into whether Zinke, the Interior Secretary, was working with David Lesar, the chairman of Halliburton, a major oil services company. Zinke’s plans for the microbrewery go back years. He was even involved in local efforts to update zoning laws to help accommodate that type of business. At the same time, Lesar was also connected to a development in Whitefish that would have included a microbrewery. The administration’s emphasis on rolling back regulations certainly extends to the Interior Department where a company like Halliburton would benefit from fewer regulations.
What’s up Next Week
The House is currently in a District Work period. The next House votes will occur on Tuesday September 4th.

2018 Farm Bill Priorities
Dear Friend, 
I am proud to represent rural America and the hardworking, God-fearing, freedom-loving agriculture producers who call West Texas home. I am even prouder to represent our region at this critical juncture, reauthorizing a new Farm Bill. With ongoing discussions happening here in West Texas and in Washington, I thought I would send along a few priorities that, if achieved, will ensure not only a strong, viable ag sector for West Texas and rural America, but continued economic growth that will benefit all Americans. 
￼ 
Priority #1 
It is a risky business to produce the food and fiber that we consume daily in this country. There is volatility in the markets, including weather and market instability. It is incredibly important that we make certain our producers have the risk management tools that provide certainty and security to stabilize the ag economy - fortunately, we address that in the House version of the Farm Bill by protecting and improving the farm safety net. 
Priority #2 
Nearly half of rural Americans lack access to broadband services.Investments in rural infrastructure like broadband technology are needed to finally close the digital divide between urban and rural communities.
Priority #3 
Lastly, our nation needs policies that encourage people to work if they are capable rather than ones that push people into generational poverty and government reliance. With over 70% of the Farm Bill’s funding going to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), we need policies that encourage work, stop trapping people in the cycle of government dependence, and fill the millions of surplus jobs in America – 7 million to be exact. It’s time for folks to get off the sidelines by instituting work requirements for able-bodied adults – it’s not only good for taxpayers and our economy, but also it’s the right thing to do for folks who are recipients of food stamps. We want folks to realize their God-given, fullest potential, and we need the right policies to incentivize the right behavior. 
As discussions continue, please know that I will continue fighting for our West Texas priorities in the final 2018 Farm Bill. It is an honor to be your Representative. Feel free to reach out to my office and let me know how I can best serve you. 
Your friend and fellow West Texan, ￼  Jodey C. Arrington Member of Congress

I have been traveling up and down Central Washington, learning about exciting developments taking place across the 4th Congressional District. From the hop farms in Yakima to the Canadian border crossing in Oroville, I have been meeting with constituents and working to make sure your voices are heard.  
House Agriculture Chairman Visits Yakima 
￼ 
Central Washington's agriculture industry is unique, and it is important that federal lawmakers and officials see first-hand the issues facing local farmers and producers. I was pleased U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Under Secretary Bill Northey recently visited our region. This week, I welcomed House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway to Central Washington, where we toured Roche Fruit to discuss Washington's iconic apple industry and John I. Haas, the nation's leading hops supplier. I was proud to show Chairman Conaway some of the hops and specialty crops we grow right here in Washington's 4th Congressional District.

Chairman Conaway and I also hosted a roundtable with local farmers to listen to questions, concerns, and priorities. We discussed the status of the upcoming Farm Bill, the effects of retaliatory tariffs on trade, and improvements we are working on for agricultural labor. Click here to watch the live feed of the roundtable. 
You can read more about Chairman Conaway's visit in the Yakima Herald. 
Keeping Water Management Local 
￼
Water providers across our region and across the West face numerous challenges to supply water, including growing demand, aging infrastructure, and changing precipitation patterns. To help irrigators and water providers in Central Washington, I was proud to introduce H.R. 6652, federal legislation to transfer title of U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) lands to the Kennewick Irrigation District (KID). By transferring title to a local entity like KID, water suppliers can better manage critical water resources and empower water managers to be as responsive, efficient, and innovative as possible in serving the community. I am proud this bill will streamline water uses while reducing government waste and burdensome regulations. Click here to read more. 
Dairy Innovation 
￼ 
Dairies in Central Washington are dedicated to being responsible stewards of the environment. Royal Dairy in Royal City was awarded the 2018 Outstanding Dairy Farm Sustainability Award from the Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy due, in large part, to their recent water treatment updates. The Allred Family uses a BioFiltro system, which uses worms to treat waste water from the dairy and essentially converts the dairy lagoon into an irrigation pond. I am pleased I was able to see this innovative new system first-hand and hear about how this family farm is committed to becoming a zero waste business.  
Health Care for a Community 
￼ 
The Columbia Basin Health Association serves the local communities of Adams, Grant, and Franklin counties. I had the opportunity to tour the Othello Clinic, where they recently expanded the facility and range of care provided. Remote, rural areas like Central Washington often face a shortage of health providers, so CBHA offers a ""one-stop shop"" for patients in need of primary care, dental, behavioral health, pharmacy, and other specialized services.
Supporting Career and Technical Education 
￼ 
West Valley School District invited me to speak to teachers and administrators as they get ready for the upcoming school year. I was grateful for the opportunity to congratulate the school district on its many successes and recognize its outstanding educational leadership. In Congress, I supported passage, and President Trump recently signed into law, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, which ensures that local school districts have flexibility to provide opportunities for students and prepare them for the workforce. 
Updates in Winthrop 
￼ 
I was invited to address the Twisp and Winthrop Chambers of Commerce, where I provided an update on what I have been working on in Congress for North Central Washington. I have been vocal in my support for the Methow Headwaters Campaign with both U.S. Interior Secretary Zinke and Agriculture Secretary Perdue. I included language in the recent Interior appropriations bill to ensure the North Cascades Smokejumper Base continues to operate in Winthrop, and I have been working with my colleagues in Congress to help prevent and mitigate the devastating wildfires we have experienced in the Pacific Northwest.  
Thank You, Veterans! 
￼ 
We would not enjoy the freedoms we have as Americans if it were not for the service of our veterans - thank you for defending our nation. I hosted a Veterans Service Fair in Moses Lake to hear their concerns and offer assistance. I am very grateful for each and every organization that participated to give resources and information to help our veterans. You can read more about the event on iFiber One here. 
Thank you for reading this e-news update. You can also connect with me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. It is an honor and a privilege to represent you in Congress. 
Sincerely, ￼  Dan Newhouse Member of Congress

￼
￼
￼
Hello, and welcome to the office. I’ve received a fair amount of mail lately from seniors who are worried that the Social Security and Medicare programs are being ignored amidst all the other more talked-about policy objectives today.  
Well I believe that this country’s seniors have worked hard to make this country all that it is today, and that our public policies should assist those same senior citizens. 
We made a promise to our seniors and they deserve the peace of mind and certainty that the programs they have been planning their retirement around will be there when they need them.   That’s why I believe there are actions we must take to help both Social Security and Medicare operate more efficiently and ensure that they remain for current and future retirees. In addition, while these programs - when solvent - can provide for our retirement years, we also want to enhance other means of retirement security for all Americans. 
I recently joined a new committee in Congress, the Committee on Ways and Means, which has jurisdiction over programs like Social Security and Medicare. I’m looking forward to pursuing efficiency, solvency, and longevity for these programs, in order to keep our promise to seniors, and to our next generation of seniors. I’m Brad Wenstrup. Thanks for visiting the office.

Teachers Change Lives
 
I recently had the opportunity to speak to educators to kick off the start of a new school year in the Kansas City Public School District. I know the value of educators and those who give their all to help children.
 
A teacher’s job is the most important job because teachers change lives. They have the ability to connect with students beyond academics, in other aspects of their lives. A teacher’s personal interest can make the difference in whether or not a student returns to school or even whether he or she graduates.

One in four students will drop out of school. But according to the National Center for Education the dropout rate is decreasing, down from 10.9 percent in 2000 to 6.1 percent in 2016. The nation is moving in the right direction, but we still have more to do.

Not everyone can be a teacher. It takes patience and understanding. But teachers cannot do it alone; they need community support and resources to do their jobs. They need increased pay and smaller classrooms to give every student the attention they deserve. They need to know their schools are safe and protected.

Teachers and staff need additional support to identify and assist at-risk students. That’s why I introduced H.R. 3552, the “Cady Housh and Jason Flatt Teen Suicide Prevention Act.” This bill, a bipartisan effort, would require teachers, principals, counselors and other staff to take youth suicide awareness and prevention training each year. Currently twenty states have enacted some form of this law.  I believe it should be expanded nationwide, so our teachers and staff have the tools they need to help save lives.

As we start another school year, let us not forget those who care for our children, so that teachers can continue to inspire, educate, and guide students into their future. 
 
Warmly,
￼
Emanuel Cleaver, II 
Member of Congress

A Busy Week in the District 
 


Dear Neighbor,
Earlier this week, I had the pleasure of attending the 22nd Annual Vietnamese-American Youth Recognition Luncheon. This event honors valedictorians and salutatorians from high schools all over the Houston area, and I was proud to wish these students well as they head to college. While at the event, I visited with Will Nguyen and his sister, Victoria.   
￼
I’m immensely pleased that Will returned safely to the United States and is back with his family. I worked on ensuring his safe return for many weeks with other Members of Congress, the State Department and the U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam. 
￼
I also met with a very inspiring group of kids living with Type 1 Diabetes. We celebrated the additional funding I helped secure this year to ensure there is enough money to keep America on track to find a cure for Juvenile Diabetes. I will continue to strongly push for life-saving diabetes research in Congress.
As we near the one-year deadline of Hurricane Harvey, I want to ensure that every Houstonian affected by the storm has a chance to apply for the National Flood Insurance Program. To be certain of this, I wrote a letter to FEMA Administrator Brock Long urging him to extend the National Flood Insurance Program deadline for submitting proof of loss for claims for an additional six months.
I reminded him that after Superstorm Sandy, the proof of loss deadline was further extended to grant individuals two years to file the proper documents. More recently, after the August 2016 floods in Louisiana, additional extensions were granted for as long as 18 months after the storm. Harvey survivors need more time, and I want everyone who needs help to have the opportunity to apply. I will continue fighting to help all our neighbors affected by Harvey. 
To let me know your thoughts on these issues or others that are important to you, you can email me here.
It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Sincerely,  ￼  John Culberson

Welcoming President Trump to Fort Drum 
President Trump has accepted my invitation to visit Fort Drum and the brave men and women of the 10th Mountain Division on Monday, August 13th. As a Member of the House Armed Services Committee and the Chair of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, I am honored that the President will sign the historic, bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act in our district at Fort Drum. I am proud of the partnership with this Administration to begin rebuilding our military and the President’s visit is an important opportunity to highlight this achievement and to thank our men and women in uniform for their service. Click here to read more about the President's visit. 
Strengthening our North Country Workforce 
￼ 
I hosted Franklin County leaders for a roundtable focused on workforce development at the FEH-BOCES in Malone. Since arriving in Congress, I’ve made over one hundred business and school visits across our district, and one of the most common issues business leaders tell me they struggle with is the ability to find skilled labor here in the North Country. Working with feedback from these leaders, and from students across our district, I co-wrote the first update to federal Career and Technical Education programs in over a decade. 
This bipartisan bill – the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act – updates our CTE policies to empower state and local community leaders, align training with in-demand jobs, and increase transparency and accountability in our federal programs. I was pleased to see President Trump sign this important initiative into law last week. I thank all of our attendees for a productive discussion on ways we can continue to develop our North Country workforce. Click here to learn more about our roundtable and my work in Congress on Career and Technical Education. 
Northern Border Roundtable 
￼
As the Representative of a Northern Border District, I know that the economies of Canada and the North Country are deeply connected. Today, I hosted a Northern Border Roundtable in Plattsburgh to discuss issues that impact both sides of our Northern Border, such as trade, tariffs, and our shared tourism economy. In Congress, I have been proud to lead on bipartisan initiatives to strengthen our partnership with Canada. I led the legislative effort to solidify the U.S. Canadian preclearance agreement to increase commerce between our two nations and strengthen border security. I have also introduced bipartisan legislation that directs U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to hire, train, and assign 5,000 new CBP officers and 350 support personnel at our ports of entry. Additionally, I am cosponsoring the PRINT Act to suspend new tariffs currently being imposed on Canadian groundwood paper – the primary source of paper used by newspapers in our district.  
Thank you to North Country Chamber of Commerce CEO, Garry Douglas, and to all of our attendees for participating in today's roundtable. I'll keep working to further strengthen our special relationship with Canada, and to improve commerce and tourism between our two nations. 
Adirondack 1892 Visit 
￼ 
On Thursday, I visited the Adirondack 1892 Home Store in Malone. Adirondack 1892 sells furniture with a focus on American-made and local products. They’re a welcome addition to the Malone community and I appreciated our discussion about issues facing small businesses. Thanks for having me!
Almanzo Wilder Farm  
￼ 
The Almanzo Wilder Farm and Homestead in Malone welcomes visitors from across the country looking to experience 19th Century farm life. As the childhood home of Almanzo Wilder, husband to Laura Ingalls Wilder, the Almanzo Wilder Farm and Homestead also holds an important place in literary history. Thank you for hosting me this week and for your continued promotion of North Country tourism!
Toys for Tots Holiday Train 
￼ 
I joined my colleagues in a bipartisan effort to save the Toys for Tots Holiday Train. This is a beloved and endearing resource that many of our region’s neediest families rely on. Discontinuing this train service will mean approximately 40,000 children and their families will not benefit from donated gifts and much needed winter hats and gloves. To learn more about our efforts to protect this important tradition, click here.  
Local Infrastructure Grants 
￼ 
I applaud the U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration for awarding a $703,000 grant to the Jefferson County Industrial Development Agency. I am pleased my office was able to provide a letter of support for this important funding that will benefit the Watertown community, and I will continue to work to strengthen our North Country infrastructure. Click here to learn more about this grant.

U.S. representatives are targeting the medical device tax, with Republicans and dozens of Democrats voting to repeal it. The 2.3% tax falls on manufacturers of medical devices, like artificial joints or catheters produced in places like Warren County, New York. Rep. Elise Stefanik says the tax is bad for business and your health.

Dear Lindsey, 
Honoring our fallen hero 
￼
Kylie Riney viewing the plaque renaming the Fairview Post Office in honor of her late husband Sgt. Douglas J. Riney 
Today was a very special and meaningful day in Fairview as we honored the service and sacrifice of Sgt. Douglas J. Riney. It’s been deeply moving to see how this community has come together to support his family. We were all honored to rename the Post Office in Sgt. Riney’s hometown so that future generations will know of this true American hero. Watch the full ceremony by clicking here. 
  
￼
Sgt. Riney with his wife Kylie and children Elea and James 
Born and raised in Fairview, Sgt. Riney graduated from Spoon River Valley High School and also volunteered as a firefighter with the Fairview Fire Protection Unit before joining the Army. A recipient of the Bronze Star, Army Commendation Medal and the Purple Heart, Sgt. Riney died on October 19, 2016 in Kabul, Afghanistan where he was serving as part of the Support Squadron, 3rd Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, from Fort Hood, Texas. Following the tragic loss of Sgt. Riney, Congresswoman Bustos passed legislation to formally rename the Fairview Post Office as the “Sergeant Douglas J. Riney Post Office” to forever honor his sacrifice.

Dear Friend,

August is in full swing. Hope you've been finding a way to beat the heat! As we approach the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Harvey and are in the thick of the Atlantic hurricane season, it is important to keep up to date on how FEMA can provide guidance and assistance before, during, and after a hurricane.

Additionally, it is important to be aware of the devastating wildfires in California. Texas is offering our help as our brave firefighters battle the intense blazes. And, on a global scale, we must be aware of human trafficking and work to end it. From the State House to the U.S. House, I am actively working with my colleagues to end human trafficking.

Sincerely,
￼
Randy K. Weber
  

MYTH VS FACT - FEMA
In the immediate aftermath of a disaster, it's easy to be overwhelmed with information. Know these important myths vs facts to help along the way.

FEMA Assistance: Myths vs Facts
MYTH: I have to wait for the inspector before I can throw things out and start cleaning out the mud or making repairs.
FACT: No. Anything that absorbed water needs to be removed from the home as soon as possible. This includes wallboard and flooring materials where mold can grow. Be sure to take pictures of damage, keep all receipts and continue working on the home.

MYTH: I can’t register with FEMA until my insurance claim has been completed.
FACT: You can register with FEMA even if your claim is not completed.

MYTH: Survivors can’t register for FEMA assistance if they have insurance.
FACT: Anyone who is affected by a disaster and lives in a county designated in a major disaster declaration may be eligible for FEMA disaster aid for their uninsured or underinsured loss or damage. FEMA cannot duplicate insurance, but some survivors may qualify for FEMA assistance for disaster-related costs not covered by insurance. To be sure, register with FEMA.

MYTH: Since I received disaster assistance last year, I can’t get it again this year.
FACT: If you have applied for federal disaster assistance in the past, you can still apply for this disaster. It is not a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

MYTH: I'm a renter. I thought FEMA assistance was only for homeowners for home repairs.
FACT: FEMA assistance is not just for homeowners. FEMA may provide assistance to help renters who lost personal property or who were displaced as well as businesses that suffered damage.

Survivors can register for FEMA assistance through Tuesday, Sept. 4, 2018, online at www.disasterassistance.gov, or may call 800-621-3362 or (TTY) 800-462-7585. Those who use 711 Relay or Video Relay Services may call 800-621-3362. The toll-free telephone numbers are open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. local time, seven days a week.

HERE TO HELP 
It's been almost one year since Americans from all corners of our great country drove in with boats and volunteers, ready to go into neighborhoods and rescue complete strangers from the rising flood waters. I've said it before and I'll say it again, thank YOU to everyone who helped during those trying days, weeks, and months following Harvey. Everything you did, big and small, meant so much to those receiving the help.

Texas has a chance to give back. Wildfires are running rampant over 283,000 acres of California. Through the Texas Intrastate Fire Mutual Aid System (TIFMAS), 98 firefighters from 29 departments are on their way to California to assist in any way possible. California needs our help, and we are answering that call. In addition to our brave men and women, 25 Texas firetrucks are headed to California. Some of our very own from Galveston's Fire Department are on their way to help.

Tragically, ten lives have been lost, thousands of people have evacuated their homes, and more than 150 homes have been destroyed.

Please join me in praying for the safety of our firefighters, the containment and quick end to the fires, comfort for Californians who have evacuated their homes and lost their homes, and peace to those who have lost loved ones.

AGAINST HUMAN TRAFFICKING
Right now, there are an estimated 40 million people enslaved. The numbers are staggering: About 20 million are trapped in labor slavery, about 5 million are exploited in sex slavery, and about 15 million are enslaved in forced marriages. Women and girls account for 71 percent of the total; children are about 25 percent of the total. Estimates for profits taken through all forms of exploitation and slavery are sickening. They total roughly $150 billion a year. Profits from commercial sexual exploitation, alone, amount to $99 billion. 

Human trafficking is a serious problem facing our world. We must raise awareness and bring an end to it.

If you are in the United States and believe someone may be a victim of human trafficking, report your suspicions to law enforcement by calling 911 or the 24-hour National Human Trafficking Resource Center line at 1-888-373-7888 or text 233-733. You may also visit their website at humantraffickinghotline.org to learn more. Trafficking victims, including undocumented individuals, are eligible for services and immigration assistance.

Dear  , 
During my time in Congress, I have always been willing to work with anyone – Democrats and Republicans – to achieve some real results for our community. The nonpartisan Lugar Center at Georgetown University recently named me again among the most bipartisan members of Congress, because I work against Washington gridlock and stand up for Burlington and Ocean Counties.
I worked to secure millions of dollars in Medicare funding for Deborah Heart and Lung Center, allowing them to hire more staff and invest in health care technology. As co-chair of the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force, I have advocated for those suffering from addiction and I have gotten law enforcement resources to keep drugs off our streets. I want to take a moment to update you on another issue that I have been working on in Congress recently.
We have a national obligation to care for our service members and their families. On Monday, President Trump will sign the Fiscal Year 2019 national defense bill into law. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) passed through both the House and Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support.
This legislation reaffirms our commitment to our men and women in uniform, restores our military’s strength, and gives service members their largest pay raise in nine years. I was proud to support this legislation that provides our military with the tools and resources needed to successfully combat today’s threats at home and abroad.
Throughout my time in Congress, supporting the men and women at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst has been one of my top priorities. JB MDL is our community’s largest employer, supporting 42,000 direct jobs and over 100,000 total jobs, and is our nation’s premier air mobility, training, and technology base. Not only does this year’s NDAA provide funding for 15 KC-46 refueling tankers at JB MDL, it protects the future of the Joint Base and our local economy by not authorizing a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission.
Strengthening and securing the future of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst is critical in order to defend our homeland and protect thousands of New Jersey jobs. I will continue fighting for JB MDL, our service members, and their families. 
I won’t ever be blinded by partisanship and I refuse to take part in the gridlock that prevents progress in Washington. If I can ever be of any assistance, please contact me by visiting my website: http://macarthur.house.gov.  
  
Thank you,

Dear Friends,
I am once again honored to celebrate the amazing work of young Idahoans who take it upon themselves to meet the rigorous standards of the Congressional Award, a public-private partnership established by Congress in 1979.
Eleven Idahoans won gold, silver or bronze awards this year and I presented two of those medals in a ceremony this week at my office.
The medals are nice. But more important is what they represent: goal setting, discipline, commitment and the responsibility that comes with meeting deadlines. Many of these students, aged 14 to 23, must move outside their comfort zones, an experience that teaches lifetime lessons.
Fulfilling the requirements is tough. It takes 400 hours of volunteer work for a gold medal, along with 200 hours of fitness, 200 hours of personal development and at least four overnights on an expedition/exploration activity.
The result is young people prepared for adulthood, including marriage, relationships, parenting and career.
Zach McCammon earned a gold medal by overcoming his tendency to complete a goal in a burst of energy and then move on to the next thing. The Congressional Award requires a steady commitment, fulfilling goals over many months.
“I learned to be patient,” said Zach, whose projects included multiple trips with his church to build houses in Mexico, work at the local food pantry, a firewood business and raising $1,200 to supply and ship 51 care packages to U.S. military personnel serving overseas.
Zach, 19, lives in Cascade and was home-schooled. He was chosen to give the commencement address for home-school graduates this year and got a standing ovation from a crowd of 1,000, a moment he calls one of the highlights of his life.
Zach, who is dyslexic, summarized his speech this way: “When you face hardship, do not give up. Rely on God to help you through your circumstances, whatever they might be.”
Today, Zach will be on a plane headed to Sterling College in Sterling, Kan., where he will run track and cross-country on a scholarship. He plans to study communications and sports management and aims to be a track and cross-country coach at the college level.
 ￼
(Zach McCammon, left, and Alexandra Hahs, are two promising Idahoans)
I presented a silver medal to Alexandra Hahs, 19, of Eagle, who graduated from Cole Valley Christian School and was a varsity basketball and volleyball player.
For Alexandra, the most rewarding aspect of the program was leadership training. She attended Girls State, Hugh O’Brian Youth Leadership and the Academy Introduction Mission at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy.
Working with students from across Idaho and the U.S., Alexandra said she learned a lot about herself and how a diverse group can accomplish big things. “Every single one of them taught me something,” she said. “To this day, I talk to people from all of those camps, whether they live in Rigby, Idaho, or Colorado or Texas.”
The experience also strengthened her faith, she said. “I love the Lord with my whole heart and I think that’s the reason I ended up doing the whole thing. It’s about opportunities to serve, opportunities to learn, opportunities to lead, and I feel that’s where I’m called.”
Alexandra is currently working three jobs and will begin part-time at the College of Western Idaho this fall. She plans to transfer to Boise State in the spring and aspires to be a teacher or own a business.
This program is a great showcase for the development of talented young people. To learn more about the award and how to get involved, visit the Congressional Award online.
Thank you,

8/10/18 13:11,Blaine’s Bulletin: Great News for Educators and Students in Missouri,"￼ 
August 10, 2018

BLAINE'S BULLETIN

This week, I had the opportunity to attend the Callaway County Teachers’ Appreciation breakfast, a wonderful event hosted by the Callaway County Chamber of Commerce. At the event, teachers from public and private schools across the county were recognized for their hard work and for the strong bonds between their school districts. It was a pleasure to meet many of our esteemed educators from Callaway County and an honor to share the many legislative solutions we’ve been working on in Washington.
In industries from manufacturing to banking to hospitality, jobs have drastically changed over the past decade. Due to recent advances in technology and a growing global economy, applicants without higher education or technical skills find it increasingly difficult to compete. While many high school graduates will head off to colleges and universities, a four-year school is not the right choice for everyone. Unfortunately, federal law regarding career and technical education (CTE) hasn’t been updated in more than a decade, failing to reflect the realities facing students and workers as they enter the workforce. 
Just days before I spoke with the Callaway County educators, President Donald Trump signed the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act into law. Introduced by my colleagues Congressman Thompson (R-PA) and Congressman Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), this legislation changes our outdated laws, assisting Americans entering the workforce by making it easier to acquire the skills they need to compete.
I was proud to support the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act because it makes it easier for states to utilize federal programs to respond to changing educational needs. It also supports innovative learning opportunities and builds better community partnerships in order to improve alignment with in-demand jobs in our local communities. Finally, it increases transparency and accountability by requiring CTE programs to deliver on their promises, empowering parents, students and stakeholders to set performance goals and evaluate the effectiveness of local programs.
Thanks to the hard work of my congressional colleagues and President Trump, students and workers across the nation will have a better opportunity to choose the educational path that gives them the best chance to succeed and helps our communities grow. As back-to-school sales begin to pop up across the district, don’t forget to thank the hardworking educators in your life who work day in and day out to prepare our students to reach their maximum potential.

Friends, 
  
I want to thank everyone for their continued support for our team! We have a jam-packed August, and if we haven’t already, we’ll soon be in a community near you! Yesterday we kicked off our Community Coffee tour in Meade County. Thank you to all who joined for coffee and conversations! Today the tour continues – I’ll be stopping in Herington today and Ashland on Monday.
  
It’s clear from yesterday’s conversations that Kansans continue to express concerns about the cost of health care. Health care remains a top priority for me - it’s what I have done all my life. I, too, have been disappointed by Congress’ inability to pass major health care legislation during this 115th Congress, and even more disappointed in our lack of focus on controlling costs through transparency, innovation, and consumerism. I promise that I will continue to move the ball on this and advocate for necessary reforms.
  
Click HERE to see the full Community Coffee schedule.
  
I hope to see you on the road!

Visit to the Big Red One for 
#VictoryWeek 
￼
I was honored to spend time at Fort Riley this week, helping troops celebrate Victory Week and the decades of success and leadership of one of the Army’s oldest divisions, the Big Red One. Victory week is an annual celebration encouraging camaraderie on the base. Each soldier competes with their unit in team sports like, flag football, softball, and soccer to earn points towards “the cup.” At the end of the week, the points are counted, and the unit with the highest points wins the Commander's Cup.
 
During my time at the base, I had the opportunity to meet with 1st Infantry Division Commanding General, John Kolasheski.Major General Kolasheski was most recently Deputy Chief of Staff for U.S. Armed Forces Command at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and has previously served two tours of duty with the 1st Infantry Division. It’s an honor to get to know and work with the 1st Infantry Division Commanding General, Kolasheski and discuss his vision and how we can help Fort Riley and the 1ID soldiers who serve our country. 
 
I also enjoyed visiting with community members at an evening barbecue and speaking with soldiers about their experiences at Fort Riley. I am proud of this Congress’ ongoing support for our military and the continued push to rebuild our armed forces, increase pay, and boost funding to provide the resources our men and women in uniform need to keep us safe. 
￼ 
While at Fort Riley this week, I also had the opportunity to tour the Advanced Turbine Engine Army Maintenance (ATEAM) Program. This program at the Marshall Army Airfield is home to the state of the art turbine engine rebuilding program. The ATEAM has almost quadrupled the lifecycle of the AGT 1500 engine from the early 1990s. This program’s unmatched expertise and technical skills are invaluable. This team does excellent work at reducing fleet sustainment costs and increasing readiness both here and abroad.
Taking care of our Vets
￼
￼ 
 
My district is home to seven Veterans Administration (VA) community-based outpatient clinics (CBOC) that provide health care services to veterans utilizing the VA healthcare program. This week I toured the Junction City and Dodge City CBOCs to learn more about the services and physicians that provide care for our veterans.
This Congress is dedicated to taking care of our veterans; in fact, the House recently funded the VA the largest amount in history. The purpose of significantly increasing our funding to the VA is that our clinics, like those in my district, have the staff and resources necessary to provide care for our veterans.
Officials at both locations noted that additional funds would go a long way with increasing staff and growing outreach efforts to ensure all veterans, no matter their age or location, receive the health care they need and deserve. Our veterans deserve timely, quality health care and should have the opportunity to have a say in their care.
  
Gearing up for school, focusing on safety
￼
As kids prepare to go back to school, they gear up with their supplies and are anxious to see old friends and make new ones. But for parents across the district, some are stricken with worry for their child’s safety.
As a father of four, it breaks my heart to see the lack of certainty of our children’s safety in public spaces. This week, I spoke with USD 443 Superintendent Dr. Fred Dierksen, and Vice Principal Jacque Feist about Dodge City’s efforts and initiatives to ensure a safe environment for all students. 
We discussed securing entryways, completing drills and making hotlines available to both students and teachers for tips on unusual or aggressive behavior. 
I am a cosponsor of the Student, Teachers, and Officers Preventing (STOP) School Violence Act, which passed the House in March, and the Securing Our Schools (SOS) Act. These pieces of legislation provide our students, educators, and law enforcement officers with the resources to report and better understand the warning signs. We must identify threats and prevent violence with training, coordination, and intervention, and I’m proud to support legislation that addresses these issues.
Airports help rural areas stay 
competitive
￼
Home to the Air Capital of the world, Kansas as a whole, heavily relies on our aircraft industry. Across the Big First we have six airports that are vital to the long-term prosperity of our district. Communities like Moundridge are using their airports as an economic development opportunity to diversify and grow their local economies. 
This week I toured Southwind Global Aviation, located at the Moundridge municipal airport. The company contracts with Textron Aviation to deliver planes manufactured in Independence, Kan., to customers around the world. Because of Southwind’s success, Moundridge officials are in the planning phase of a runway expansion project that would allow the company to bring in larger jets for delivery. As part of the project, the community would add additional hangar space for new companies and individuals wanting to call Moundridge home. 
Airports are a vital component to keeping our rural areas competitive, and I’m proud to see communities like Moundridge utilize their infrastructure assets for economic growth. 

""Year of the Tree""
￼
2018 is the “Year of the Tree,"" for Rotary Clubs across the country. I joined my hometown Rotary club this week in its tree dedication ceremony. The Great Bend Rotary dedicated a Ginkgo tree for the year’s theme. 
In 1940, Boy Scout Troop #110 planted a Ginkgo tree near the Barton County Courthouse that was also sponsored by The Great Bend Rotary Club. Today there are three known Ginkgo trees in Great Bend. One Ginkgo tree is located at the corner of 16th Street and Jackson, one is at 2611 Broadway, and one is at the north end of the Barton County Court House Square.
The dedication was led by my friend Lee Musil, President of the Great Bend Rotary.  And Dr. Franklin Reinhardt, an original member of the #110 Boy Scout Troop, joined us for the occasion.  I was glad to be a part of this dedication with some of my hometown friends, one of the many perks of being back home in the First District.

A Busy Week Running around North Dakota & Hearing from North Dakotans
￼
At the groundbreaking ceremony for the Xcel Energy Fox Tail Wind Farm near Ellendale on Thursday, I met several young families who are working to strengthen our state's economy and increase the range of opportunities for their families and towns. These North Dakotans are the future of our rural communities, and I'm fighting for them every day in the U.S. Senate.
August is a special time here in North Dakota. Harvest has begun, 9-man football practices are going strong, and kids (and adults) across the state are trying to squeeze out the last days of summer. Over the past week, I've traveled across the state to listen to the concerns and priorities of North Dakotans, share the wins I secured for our state in the Senate Farm Bill, and talk about my work to bolster North Dakota's energy industry and push for better, smarter trade policies. 
EARLIER THIS MONTH, I WAS NAMED TO THE FARM BILL CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. I’ve always said that as a U.S. Senator from North Dakota, my top priority is getting a Farm Bill done— which is why I'm proud to serve on the Senate Agriculture Committee. That’s what we did in 2014, and I want to make sure it happens again this year before the September 30 deadline. Last week, I was one of nine senators appointed to the Farm Bill conference committee which is tasked with reaching a compromise agreement between the U.S. Senate and U.S. House Farm Bills. Amid trade uncertainty and low commodity prices, we need to make sure our farmers have a strong safety net, support young farmers like these North Dakota FFA leaders, and expand access to markets. Click here to listen to my interviews with American Ag Network and NewsDakota about my 2018 Farm Bill priorities as we continue negotiations. 
""ONE CONCERN AMONG FARMERS IS THE ONGOING TRADE WAR."" For farmers in North Dakota and across the country, patience is wearing thin with the administration’s escalating trade war. For instance, the folks in North Dakota who grow and haul soybeans are already worried about finding a market for this year’s crop— and stoking additional retaliatory tariffs from China will only make their crop less valuable and harder to sell. Last week, I met with Canadian Deputy Ambassador to the United States Kirsten Hillman to talk about how we can find a swift and fair resolution to NAFTA talks, so North Dakota producers who depend on Canadian markets to survive can have much-needed certainty. In our meeting, I also brought up the concerns of North Dakota potato growers in Grand Forks, who have longstanding concerns about U.S. potato market access. And in Valley City on Monday, I heard firsthand about how local businesses and leaders are working to expand economic development in the community— as well as their fears about a long-term trade war and its impacts on agri-business. 

THE ANSWER (TO SUPPORTING AN ALL-OF-THE-ABOVE ENERGY STRATEGY) IS BLOWIN' IN THE WIND: On Wednesday, I was presented with the American Wind Energy Association's Wind Champion Award while visiting the Geronimo Energy wind farm near Courtenay. I'm very proud of my work to support wind energy development in North Dakota by successfully extending the wind energy tax credit in 2015. Prior to my work to secure this extension, hundreds of wind energy workers were laid off nationwide, including in North Dakota. Now that more certainty has been restored across the industry, North Dakota is the number-one state in the country for wind energy jobs per capita in 2017. I was honored to receive this award, and on Thursday, I helped break ground on the new XcelEnergy Foxtail Wind Farm project near Ellendale. Projects like Foxtail show firsthand the potential for continued growth of wind energy jobs across North Dakota.  
￼
The West Fargo Police Department's annual Night to Unite Event is a fantastic opportunity to educate the area about the important work that peace officers do every day to keep our communities strong and safe. On Tuesday, I even got to meet some of the viral stars in the Department who are showing all of us how to carry out critical community outreach— in an informative and engaging way. 
GIVING NORTH DAKOTA'S MOST INSPIRING GRANDPARENTS THE TOOLS THEY NEED: On Tuesday, I met with several grandparents who have adopted or are fostering their grandkids as a result of suicide, opioid abuse, and other circumstances that leave the children’s biological parents unable to care for them—  an arrangement known as ""grandfamilies."" The grandfamilies I met are heroes to all of us— but particularly to the kids they care for. Earlier this year, I secured much-needed funding to support grandfamilies and other family caregivers, and I’m pushing to pass my bipartisan Supporting Kinship Connections Act which I introduced to help states like North Dakota connect caregivers with the resources they need to quickly fulfill the role of primary caretaker for vulnerable kids.
ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS DESERVE TO BE COUNTED. Last week, I led a bipartisan effort requesting information on the Census Bureau’s plan to ensure an accurate and cost-effective 2020 Census count in our tribal communities. Historically, Native Americans have been under-represented in Census data, which then reduces the amount of federal support that tribal communities receive. As the 2020 Census approaches, the agency must take steps to make sure these communities are counted fairly and accurately, so that tribal citizens can receive the federal funds they need to improve public safety, promote access to affordable housing, and provide high-quality education and health care. And to build on my efforts to improve safety in Indian Country, I also helped introduce a bipartisan bill to crack down on human trafficking in tribal communities by narrowing gaps between tribal officials and the federal government.  
ICYMI: SHARING THE STORIES OF HARD-WORKING FAMILIES IMPACTED BY THE MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION CRISIS. Last month, following the fifth hearing of the 16-person bipartisan committee tasked with solving the multiemployer pension crisis, I facilitated a Facebook live stream to give workers and retirees a platform to share their heartbreaking stories firsthand about how devastating it would be for them to lose their hard-earned pensions. Over 2,000 North Dakotans who paid into the Central States Pension Fund did everything right, worked hard, and saved for their retirements. But now, they could face financial ruin at no fault of their own. We'll keep fighting to make sure their voices are heard, and I'll keep pushing for my Butch Lewis Act to be part of a legislative solution.

Your July Recap 
From Congressman Rod Blum
July was a very eventful month for the First District. Along with securing the $117 million in federal funds needed to build the Cedar Rapids flood wall, I had the opportunity to tour around the first district and hear directly from constituents. 
￼

 Announcements
My heart is broken for the Tibbetts Family and the community of Brooklyn as the search continues for Mollie Tibbetts. Please keep a look out for Mollie and if you have any further information, please Call 1-800-452-1111 or visit the website for Crime Stoppers of Central Iowa linked here. 
￼
￼
Very inspiring to see so many Iowans helping out Iowans following the tornados in Marshalltown and Pella. I will continue to monitor the recovery efforts, and please reach out to my office if there is any way we can assist. For more details on how to help, check out this article in the Des Moines Register. 
￼
Thank you to Camadant Timon Oujiri and staff for all you did to ensure the safety of veteran residents and for opening space to the Marshalltown community to use during the extreme storms and tornado. We’re here for you through the recovery process. 
￼

 In the District
Thank you to the over 11,600 constituents of the first district who joined the conversation on my 4th tele-town-hall this year. Questions included national debt, 2nd amendment, franking mailers, school violence, police officers' safety, welfare reform, immigration reform, border security, etc.
￼
￼
I stopped by Grinnell to view the impressive community collaboration bringing fruition to the park project and advancing the Veteran Memorial Building improvements.
￼
￼
A quick stop at McNally’s Foods for coffee to-go. A creative small town atmosphere honoring the building’s previous use as a Ford car dealership built in 1920.
￼
￼
Thank you, Director Charlie Becker and the entire team at Camp Courageous in Monticello. Your work supporting the special needs community and families in the First District is a testament to the best in humanity-- and all achieved without any government dollars.
￼
￼
Thank you to all who came to my Veterans Job and Wellness Fair! Incredible community support for veterans in the Cedar Rapids area. If you were unable to attend, please contact my office for a list of employers and service providers: 319-364-2288.
￼
￼
My friend Flossie at Culvers is the epitome of Iowa Nice. Thank you always for your kindness!

On behalf of a grateful nation, it was my honor to present Navy Veteran Rick Kaufman (left) and Army Veteran Jerome Thompson (deceased)—his son Jay accepting in his place (right)—their duly earned service medals. Thank you for your service!
￼



IA-01 Special Guests
President Trump hosted a roundtable at the Northeast Iowa Community College Campus in Dubuque to discuss workforce development-- an issue that is paramount to the continued economic growth of Iowa. Welfare reform, immigration reform, and worker training/development are a few of the ways we can make this happen.
￼
￼
Vice President Pence visited Cedar Rapids to discuss benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and to meet with employees at Rockwell Collins.
￼
￼
Thank you to my good friend OMB Director Mick Mulvaney for coming to Cedar Rapids to tour the flood infrastructure project that was approved through the Office of Management and Budget. The First District is extremely grateful for your partnership in delivering this system to protect lives, homes, and businesses. 
￼
￼

Important discussion on needed lock and dam improvements in Dubuque with my friend Rep. Mark Meadows who sits on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and Chairs the House Freedom Caucus.
￼
 
In Washington, D.C. 
I am very proud to have introduced a new, bipartisan bill to authorize the fourth White House Conference on Small Business to give small businesses throughout the country a direct voice in the legislation and agenda impacting their growth and success. More details in my press release below.
￼
￼
Thank you Russell from Grinnell College for dropping by my DC office- go Fox Squirrels! 
￼
￼
We had a packed room and it was at times contentious in our Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing to question Peter Strozk.
￼
￼
Vicky is originally from Madrid, Spain but chose to go to school at Luther College in Decorah. She recognizes the quality education and job opportunities Iowa offers. Good luck on your senior year and thanks for stopping by my office Vicky!
￼
￼
Met with the Iowa Farm Bureau and Iowa Corn Growers in my D.C. office. We agree that Iowa farmers need some wins from President Trump and Vice President Pence. Here's the list: Sign trade deal with Mexico, allow year-round E15 gas, pass compromise Farm Bill, and appoint a new RFS-friendly EPA Director.
￼
￼
Thank you to our impressive DC interns: Ally, Hunter, and Jules— and thank you for all of your help this summer! We are now accepting applications for the fall- apply at the link here. 
￼
￼
I chaired our Small Business subcommittee hearing “Investing in Rural America” to discuss ways to open access to capital for small businesses in rural areas to expand and hire more individuals in rural areas. Thank you to our informed witnesses for joining!

Constituent Corner
Congratulations to Hannah Duncan from Belle Plaine who will be participating in the 2018 National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America Carnegie Hall - I am sure you will represent the First District well!
￼

In the News
A classy gentleman who led Iowa with poise and humility. He will be missed, but his impact on our great state is still felt today. 
￼
￼
Amazing news this morning: our economy is reignited at 4.1% GDP growth thanks to passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and decreased job killing regulations.
￼
￼
Thanks to passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, there is more competition for labor that is resulting in higher wages. Because of this, it was recently announced that we have reached the highest worker pay rates since 2008. 
￼
￼
Thanks to passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, U.S. multinational firms brought $305.6 billion (previously held offshore) back to the US during the first quarter of 2018 alone. 
￼

Thank you for reading my July recap!

Dear Friends, 
Happy Friday! Before the weekend kicks off, I wanted to send you a few important updates. Let's get to it! 
Our Economy Continues To Grow 
In order to help more Wisconsinites achieve the American Dream, I have worked tirelessly to promote pro-growth policies. This includes letting you keep more of your hard-earned money, cutting bureaucratic red tape, and promoting American energy dominance. Now, we have a booming job market in Wisconsin and around the nation. 
According to the National Federation of Independent Business, small business job openings are at a record high. With more job openings than unemployed Americans, there is no better time to enter the workforce!   Share the good economic news with your friends by sharing the graphic HERE or by clicking the photo below. 
￼  
 Douglas County Mobile Office Hours Next Week 
One of our casework specialists will be hosting mobile office hours in Douglas County next Wednesday. You're encouraged to attend if you need assistance with federal agencies or casework.
Click HERE or the image below for more details!

Washington DC Internship Opportunity 
Attention college students or recent grads: my Washington DC office is now accepting applications for Fall internships. It's a great way to serve your community and get involved in the political process.   For more information on the internship, click HERE or the photo below. Also be sure to share these opportunities with any interested students!

Dear Friends,  
I was at the White House last week with President Trump as he signed my career and technical education bill into law.   The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act is landmark education legislation that overhauls the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act. This is the first update to the program since 2006 and it is an important step forward for the American worker. The bill I authored with Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) boosts program funding by $1.3 billion annually.   Millions of Americans are out of work today, but millions of jobs are unfilled: It’s called the skills gap. This country needs carpenters, plumbers, manufacturers, electricians, programmers and more. These are good-paying, family-sustaining jobs, but we don’t have enough qualified workers who are able or willing to fill these positions. 
That’s where CTE comes in. 
CTE can open doors for students through a combination of rigorous academics and applied learning experiences, often in real-life workplace settings. They're able to immerse themselves in the workplace and see what their lives will be like as they contribute to their communities. Exposing students to this type of career education often leads to apprenticeships with local employers or other skills-based programs that help students with the kind of postsecondary education they need to find fulfilling careers. The same goes for adult learners who maybe seeking a new skillset to get a promotion or a higher-paying job.  I have championed this bill throughout my Congressional tenure, and I am incredibly proud that it has been signed into law.  We can’t guarantee success in life, but we can give all Americans an equal opportunity to access the skills they need to be successful. 
Thanks for taking the time to read this message, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. 
Sincerely,  ￼  U.S. Representative Glenn 'GT' Thompson

Congressman Thompson Talks CTE on C-SPAN  
Congressman Thompson joined C-SPAN's Washington Journal to speak about his career and technical education bill one day after the House of Representatives unanimously approved the legislation. It was the final vote before the bill went to the President's desk to be signed.  The bill's cosponsor Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat from Illinois, joined Congressman Thompson for the discussion.

News from Congresswoman Rosen
￼
Dear Friend, 
This week, I had the pleasure of meeting with people across Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District doing amazing work for veterans, students, and the business community. I’m proud of the hard work they are doing to better our community.
CONTINUING THE FIGHT TO END VETERAN HOMELESSNESS 
I toured Veterans Village 3 Assisted Living Residence, whose mission includes providing veterans who are recovering from an illness or injury with support services, including transportation, casework, and help with medical planning. 
￼ 
Rep. Jacky Rosen (NV-03) tours Veterans Village 3 near downtown Las Vegas.   
 
Our veterans have put their lives on the line to protect this nation and the very least we can do is support programs and facilities to prevent veterans from becoming homeless and ensure those living on the streets get the support they need to get back on their feet. In Congress, I’ve introduced bipartisan legislation to reauthorize key programs that provide outreach and services to homeless veterans. I will continue to fight for increased resources and funding to support those who have sacrificed so much to defend our country. Read more about my visit to Veterans Village 3 Assisted Living Residence here. 
HELPING STUDENT VETERANS AND TRANSITIONING SERVICEMEMBERS FIND GOOD-PAYING JOBS  
I had the opportunity to visit UNLV’s College of Engineering and tour the university’s cyber labs. During my visit I was able to discuss my Solar VETS Act and Hire Student Veterans Act, two bipartisan bills I introduced aimed at helping veterans and exiting servicemembers find good-paying jobs. With Nevada being home to more than 200,000 veterans, and over 56,000 veterans living in Nevada’s 3rd District alone, it is vital that we provide our returning veterans with the tools necessary to successfully rejoin civilian life.
￼ 
Rep. Jacky Rosen (NV-03) visits UNLV’s College of Engineering, discusses bipartisan bills to help veterans find good-paying jobs. 
In June, I introduced the Solar VETS Act, which would direct the U.S. Department of Energy to implement a workforce training program to help prepare our nation's transitioning military personnel for careers in the solar energy industry. Last month, I introduced the Hire Student Veterans Act, which would expand the existing Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) to ensure that all student veterans using their GI benefits can take advantage of valuable paid internships or work opportunities while in school. I will continue to introduce and fight for legislation that will positively impact the lives of Nevada’s veteran community. Read more about my visit to the UNLV College of Engineering here. 
SUPPORTING OUR NEVADA BUSINESS COMMUNITY 
This week, I also toured the Seafood City Supermarket in Henderson and met with the local Asian-American business community to discuss my efforts to support Southern Nevada’s minority-owned business community. I am a member of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and the U.S.-Philippines Friendship Caucus and continuously seek to support legislation that will help our 200,000 small businesses in Nevada succeed.
Since coming to Congress, I’ve voted across party lines to help small businesses thrive in Nevada. I’ve been supporting bipartisan bills to help us invest in our workforce, close the skills gap, and support startups and entrepreneurs by giving them the tools and resources they need to succeed. I will continue to be an advocate for smart, pro-growth solutions that support Nevada’s small and minority-owned business community. Read more about my visit to Seafood City here. 
￼ 
Rep. Jacky Rosen (NV-03) tours Seafood City's new supermarket in Henderson and discusses her efforts to support minority-owned businesses in Nevada. 
  
I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU 
As always, I want to hear from you. Call my office; find me on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram; or email me. Sign up for my e-newsletter here to receive regular updates on my legislative work. 
It’s an absolute honor to represent you in Congress.

Honoring NYC Councilman Stanley E. Michels

Dear Friend, 

I hope you will join me on Saturday, August 11th at 10:00 a.m. as we honor New York City Councilman Stanley Michels during a ceremony to rename the United States Post Office facility located at 4558 Broadway the “Stanley Michels Post Office Building.” 

Stanley E. Michels was born in Manhattan and served as a New York City councilman from 1978 through 2001. He was elected to the City Council a total of seven times to represent District Six which includes Washington Heights, West Harlem, Inwood, and parts of Morningside Heights and central Harlem. 

During his tenure, Mr. Michels made significant contributions to environmental reform in New York City and was a key sponsor of the Clean Indoor Air Act, the city’s first law regulating smoking in public places. In 1982, he sponsored Local Law I, the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Act, making the presence of peeling lead-based paint in apartments housing children under 6 one of the most serious violations of the city housing code. Mr. Michels was also instrumental in repairing and renovating parks throughout the city, particularly in Northern Manhattan: Ft. Tryon Park, Inwood Hill Park, Highbridge Park and Public Swimming Pool, Bennett and Isham Parks. 

￼


During the 115th Congress, I introduced a bill in the U.S. House to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 4558 Broadway in Manhattan, New York as the Stanley Michels Post Office Building. Watch video from the U.S. House floor in support of this effort, and I hope you will join me to rename the post office facility in honor of Mr. Michels and to celebrate his life and legacy with this fitting tribute.

Event is open to the public and members of the press.

Dear Friend, 
As your Representative in Congress for New Jersey’s Ninth Congressional District, I always want to keep you informed about my work in Washington and in New Jersey. 
Fighting Trump Administration for Withholding Criminal Justice Grants 
For nearly a year, Donald Trump’s Justice Department has withheld law enforcement grants from states and towns that won’t kowtow to their right-wing, anti-immigrant objectives. I have long opposed these policies. To continue to fight these efforts, I was proud to stand in Newark City Hall with fellow Representatives Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ) and Donald Payne, Jr. (D-NJ), and with Mayor Ras Baraka, and Essex County Sheriff Armando Fontoura where we spoke out against this extortion. No one should ever play politics with our law enforcement, but this is exactly what Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions are doing. 
￼
 From left, Rep. Donald Payne, Mayor Ras Baraka, Rep. Bill Pascrell, Jr., Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr. and Essex County Sheriff Armando Fontoura in Newark City Hall
By withholding nearly $6 million for New Jersey, the Trump administration is trying to use federal funds to force their radical ideas on local police. It is wrong for law enforcement strategies to be undermined so Trump can enforce his cruel, draconian immigration policies. Like using children as pawns, holding local police hostage is despicable, and I am glad New Jersey is fighting back tooth and nail. Recently, New Jersey’s Attorney General Grewal filed a lawsuit against the Department of Justice over its withholding of federal funds earmarked to Garden State law enforcement. The lawsuit alleges that the Trump administration’s embargo of these monies is illegal and seeks a court order to free them.
The value of these federal funds is felt in nearly every corner of the Americans criminal justice system. These funds allow state and local governments to support a broad range of activities to prevent and control crimes through technical assistance, training, personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, and information systems for criminal justice. I am thankful for the efforts of Governor Murphy and Attorney General Grewal for working to free this money and highlighting the Trump administration’s obstructionism. In the meantime, I will continue to fight for these funds in Washington. 
You can read more about how we are fighting to release these federal funds here. 
House of Representatives Approves Congressional Gold Medal for Baseball Pioneer and Patersonian Larry Doby
A proud product of Paterson, New Jersey, Lawrence Eugene “Larry” Doby (1923-2003) spent his life breaking barriers. Facing unfathomable cruelty and racism from the public and his own teammates, Doby stood on the diamond so that other black players who would follow him could enjoy better opportunities. He succeeded, and in so doing also helped bring America forward at the dawn of the civil rights era. In recognition of Doby’s greatness and for his contribution to this country, the House of Representatives passed the Larry Doby Congressional Gold Medal Act (H.R. 1861). 
For those who do not know, Larry Doby became the first African American to play professional baseball in the American League. Doby also served in the United States Navy in the Pacific during World War II. Upon his honorable discharge in 1946, Doby played baseball in the Negro Leagues for the Newark Eagles, taking groundballs as an infielder at the old Ruppert Stadium, and nearby at Hinchliffe Stadium in Paterson. In 1947, Doby’s contract was purchased by the Cleveland Indians shortly after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in the National League. Doby played his first Major League game on July 5, appearing as a pinch hitter in a Saturday game at Comiskey Field against the Chicago White Sox. Over a 13-year career, Doby was voted to seven All-Star squads, appeared in 1,533 games, and batted .283, with 253 home runs and 969 runs batted in. After his playing career, Doby became the manager of the White Sox in 1978, making him the second black Major League club man! ager. Doby was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998. 
In addition to being the first African American to hit a home run in a World Series, Larry Doby was deeply committed to his community. In expression of this commitment, Larry served as the Director of Community Relations for the NBA’s New Jersey Nets. This position gave Larry the opportunity to influence youth in many of New Jersey’s inner cities. 
To celebrate the passage of H.R. 1861 in the House, I joined my friend and lead Republican sponsor of the bill, Representative Jim Renacci (R-OH) at the National Museum of African American History and Culture. It was a privilege to see Doby’s jersey and pamphlets from Paterson being displayed in the museum.

New Jewish Family Service and Children’s Center of Clifton-Passaic 
I was proud to join Rabbi Michael Bleicher at Jewish Family Service (JFS) and Children’s Center of Clifton-Passaic to open their new community facility. This facility will provide social services and mental health support and assistance for children and families in need. 
I have long supported JFS and the work they’ve done in the community to help victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Specifically, I supported JFS grant applications to secure federal funding, including $200,000 for their Naturally Occurring Retirement Community “Aging in Place” initiative, and $300,000 for their Project S.A.R.A.H. (Stop Abusive Relationships At Home). These federal funds have aided JFS’s mission to provide sanctuary to victims of domestic abuse, and to offer physical and psychological services to survivors and their families. 
￼
Rep. Bill Pascrell, Jr. speaks at New Jewish Family Service and Children’s Center of Clifton-Passaic 
Because of these federal funds, JFS Clifton has trained over 5,400 individuals on prevention and treatment of sexual abuse, domestic violence, and stalking. The new JFS & Children’s Center of Clifton-Passaic looks beautiful and will provide crucial services to our communities for years to come. 
You can learn more about the new Jewish Family Service and Children’s Center of Clifton-Passaic here. 
Be assured that I will continue working to assist you with any federal issues. My first priority in Congress is representing the people of Northern New Jersey, so please continue to contact me to express your views and ideas. I encourage you to stay updated on my work in Congress by visiting my website, and Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Flickr pages.

August 7, 2018
Dear Friend,  
Protecting Medicare for Florida's seniors is a top priority of mine in Congress, which is why I have led several bipartisan measures to preserve and enhance this vital program. The first was aimed at preventing fraud in Medicare and Medicaid, which hurts seniors by costing both programs a significant amount of money.  This recent article discusses over $2 billion dollars worth of fraud uncovered in just one investigation.  My bill, which was signed into law earlier this year, increases the criminal and civil penalties for fraud in these programs.  This is something that has not been done in over 20 years.  I was joined by my colleague, Kathy Castor, in this bi-partisan initiative. Another bill I sponsored, which recently passed the House, is also aimed at reducing fraud and abuse within Medicare while improving care coordination.  It requires high risk beneficiaries to select the pharmacy of their choice and utilize this pharmacy (a chain is permissible) for all of their medications. This is a win-win because it will benefit patients and the program.   
I also successfully sponsored an effort which is now law, to remove the cap on therapies that previously existed in the Medicare program.  For example, if a senior needed physical therapy, occupational therapy or speech therapy, there was an annual limit of $2000 for these services. If you or a loved one have ever had a stroke or severe injury such as a broken bone, you know that the cost associated with therapy to fully recover far exceeds that amount. The policy was unfair to seniors, so I worked tirelessly for many years on behalf of the many constituents who brought the problem to my attention and was proud to finally fix it. 
Many seniors are negatively impacted by the rising costs of medications.  This year we passed legislation to close the donut hole in Medicare Part D in 2019, which is one year sooner than originally projected.  This will help seniors who struggle to afford their medications.  I know we have to do more to bring down the cost of medications, and the Health Subcommittee I serve on is working very hard on this priority.  Additionally, I sponsored bipartisan legislation which was recently signed into law that incentivizes competition within the generic drug market. Please know that I am committed to solving this problem and remain open minded about all potential solutions.   
Another issue I am working on related to Medicare is convincing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) that it is has both the statutory authority and moral obligation to authorize payment of dental services that are medically necessary.  I have confirmed with the medical professionals that right here in our community and throughout the country there are many cases of Medicare beneficiaries who have died, been denied critical procedures or have had their medical conditions severely worsened because they suffer from dental infection they couldn't afford to treat due to a lack of access to care.  The presence of the oral infection either prevented them from being able to receive treatment for their medical condition (as in the case of an organ transplant for example) or complicated their health condition (such as patients undergoing heart surgery, etc.).  I am working with Congressman Sanders Levin to get a bipartisan group of my colleagues to joi! n me in writing a letter urging CMS to change this practice, as we believe it is not only financially prudent, but simply the right thing to do.   
The long-term solvency of Medicare is critical.  To be clear, I understand the need to protect funding for this vital program because our seniors depend upon it, and I will not support any bill that negatively impacts current recipients or those that are nearing retirement.  I am preparing legislation that will be filed soon which creates a bipartisan commission of experts that will generate potential solutions for the program's long-term sustainability.  The politics have to be removed from the equation.  This is what was done in the early 80's under President Reagan and Speaker Tip O'Neill. The fact that we have a future shortfall is a fact we cannot ignore. We need to review all possible solutions and work together in order to select the best option for future seniors. I will continue to do everything in my power to represent the best interest of all my constituents, including seniors.   
Sincerely,
￼ 
Gus Bilirakis

8/9/18 10:06,Big problem,"￼ 

Friends, 
It's been a busy, productive week crisscrossing the 23rd District of Texas to hear from constituents how Washington policies impact South and West Texans back home. Take a look:  
The Kate Marmion Regional Cancer Medical Center at our Uvalde Memorial Hospital provides high quality treatment services and care that are vital for the health and wellness of thousands of folks I represent. I was proud to congratulate them this week on seven years of service to South Texans. 
￼ 
I had a productive discussion this week with veterans service officers from Maverick, Uvalde, Val Verde and Zavala counties about issues impacting our local veterans. It's so important to me that those who have fought for our freedoms receive the care they deserve.  
￼ 
Cross-border trade is the lifeblood of many towns I represent along the Texas-Mexico border, including Del Rio. My thanks to the Del Rio Rotary Club for inviting me to come speak to y'all this week! I will continue to educate other leaders in Washington, DC on what South and West Texans have to lose if NAFTA falls flat.  
￼ 
To maintain our national security, we need enough creative problem solvers to fill jobs in today's industries, and in those that don't even exist yet. I stopped by the Scobee Education Center's Girl's STEM Summit in San Antonio to encourage these young women to continue learning these important concepts.  
￼ 
Last year in the 23rd District of Texas alone, the National Park Service faced over $120 million in backlogged maintenance projects, including repairs to roads, visitor facilities, trails and other park structures. You don't have to be a math major to realize that's a lot of backlog, and a big problem. Learn how I'm helping to fix our parks in my latest Hurd on the Hill column.  
￼ 
I look forward to seeing more of you in the district this week! 
In order to do my job to the best of my ability, I rely on regular feedback from you. Please don't hesitate to reach out to my office with any concerns. For further updates on my work for you, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube at @HurdontheHill.  
Have a great rest of your week, and be sure to share this email with your family and friends!
Sincerely, 
-W

August 7, 2018
Dear Friend, 
After the Parkland tragedy, I reached out to local Superintendents, School Board members and Sheriffs in the 12th Congressional district asking how the federal government can support them in their mission to keep kids safe in school, which I know is important to all of us.  They told me that the single most important factor in improving safety is the hiring of well-trained School Resource Officers.  Sadly, the school districts in the 12th congressional district and throughout the state of Florida do not have sufficient resources to provide a certified School Resource Officer on every campus.  Many of these districts are among the largest school systems in the country.  
While we successfully increased federal grant funding in our last budget bill for the purpose of hiring school resource officers, I knew more support was needed. Therefore, I filed the Promoting Resource Officers Together for Exceptionally Critical Targets with Key Investments in Districts and Schools Act of 2018 (PROTECT KIDS Act).  The PROTECT KIDS Act would create a funding stream for employing School Resource Officers (SROs) in schools.    
The bill authorizes an appropriation of $225,000,000 for the hiring of SROs, and creates a five year Department of Justice matching grant program which will prioritize funding for the nation’s largest school districts (those with 65,000 students or more).  Each of the three counties in Tampa Bay serve more students than this and would qualify for the program.  Districts could apply for up to $10,000,000 in matching funds for the hiring of SROs, with a maximum of $20,000 allocated to each school.  The PROTECT KIDS Act will help assure parents that their children have a safe and secure learning environment.  To access a copy of the PROTECT KIDS Act, click here.  I remain committed to fighting for school safety and work with my colleagues to get this important legislation signed into law. 
Sincerely,
￼ 
Gus Bilirakis

RALPH'S ROUND-UP
It is now August, and we are seeing America stronger at home and abroad, with a booming economy, safer communities, and a revived military.

Here is what has happened in Washington, D.C. these past two weeks:

LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Rep. Norman Introduced:
I introduced the Funds In Legal Evaluation Act, or the FILE Act. This bill would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to review how organizations, such as Planned Parenthood, spend federal dollars.
This common-sense legislation will ensure that organizations are complying with federal law and not using tax payer dollars to provide abortions. If an organization has failed to follow the law and used federal funds for abortion services, then they will be denied future funding.
Organizations, such as Planned Parenthood, are already required to submit an annual accounting of how they spent funds they received, but the HHS Secretary does not review them in a timely manner. This means that Planned Parenthood continues to provide abortion-related services, but we are not aware whether or not they use taxpayer dollars to do so.
It only makes sense to ensure that the Secretary of HHS reviews how taxpayer dollars are spent and federal laws are being followed in a timely manner.
This #WastefulWednesday, I introduced a bill that would prohibit the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from studying the impact of cigar flavors. HHS awarded more than $100,000 of taxpayer dollars to research how the flavor of a cigar related to the likelihood of young adults beginning to smoke.
What a #wasteful use of Americans’ hard earned dollars. Shouldn’t HHS award grants to research that will help individuals overcome tobacco addiction, instead of on the impact of flavors of cigars? My hope is that this legislation will serve as a reminder to HHS to allocate its funds to research that will lead to outcomes that benefit the American public.
House Passed:
The conference report for the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA): We remain committed to rebuilding our military. The NDAA updates military infrastructure, restores military readiness, & provides necessary funding so troops can face the global threats of the 21st Century. Furthermore, this bill provides the largest pay raise for our troops in 9 years!
H.R. 2353 – Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act: This bill reauthorizes the Carl D. Perkins CTE Act to help grow apprenticeships. With a growing economy we need a growing labor force to fill the skills gap, and this bill will only help that happen!
H.R. 6199- Restoring Access to Medication Act of 2018: This bill provides relief from the tax on over the counter medications caused by the Affordable Care Act. It also modernizes Health Savings Accounts (HSA).

THE TAX LAW’S IMPACT ON BUSINESS IN THE 5TH

It was honor and privilege to invite Tibi Czentye, the CEO of All Pro Solutions, Inc. of Rock Hill, to testify with the House Small Business Committee on how tax reform has benefited his small business.
As a result of tax reform being signed into law, All Pro Solutions has been able to buy extra and newer equipment; they have already seen an increase in sales; they are now expanded their archiving work; and they will soon be hiring two more employees due to these wonderful circumstances.
His story proves that these tax cuts were for everyone, they are working on a local level, and these tax cuts are beneficial.

NATIONAL PURPLE HEART DAY
￼ 
Sergeant Dave Walas, of Tega Cay (first from left in the picture above), lost both of his legs 46 years ago while serving our nation in Vietnam. Even while in excruciating pain and suffering from massive blood loss, Sgt. Walas continued to fight and defend America. Because of his heroic actions and sacrifices made, he was rightfully given the Purple Heart. And today, he now marches three miles in every Tega Cay 4th of July parade.
Yesterday, we paused to remember and honor all of the courageous service members, like Sgt. Walas, for the pain they have felt on the battlefield and those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice defending our nation on National Purple Heart Day.
No matter what circumstances our Armed Forces face at home or abroad, they continue to fight for our country and protect our freedoms. For this, we are eternally grateful.

CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL-AMERICAN CITIES
I introduced a House Resolution, H. Res. 1002, expressing congratulations to the towns of Camden, Bethune, Elgin, and Kershaw County for being named 1 of 10 All-American Cities winners. Since 1949, the All American City National Civic League issues an award to 10 communities celebrating and recognizing neighborhoods, towns, cities, counties, and regions that engage in initiative, inclusive, and effective efforts to tackle critical and local challenges.

COMMUNICATING WITH YOU!
 
￼
I am honored to be one of 11 Members of Congress to receive the Ronald Reagan Award for effectively communicating with my constituents about the positive impacts tax reform is having on Americans and our economy.
Since January, I have directly informed and heard from constituents about how tax reform is helping to improve their lives by doing the following:
	•	hosting several tele-town halls,
	•	multiple visits to businesses,
	•	meeting with constituents,
	•	op-eds,
	•	e-newsletters,
	•	and social media updates.

Dear Friends, 
It is a tremendous privilege to serve you in the United States House of Representatives. Members of Congress perform many different roles. As a Member of the United States Congress, we have been working to ensure the protection of individual voting rights and fighting to  stop the elimination of insurance coverage of Americans and Houstonians that have pre-existing conditions. Additionally, I have introduced legislation regarding the protection of cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Over the last year, our community has had to contend with the impact of Hurricane Harvey. Throughout, the legislative year, I introduced legislation to help our community recover from the devastating effects from Hurricane Harvey.  Immediately after the storm, I introduced H.R. 3686, the Hurricane Harvey Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2017, which set aside $170 billion for recovery efforts.  Much of the provisions for which I advocated were included in H.R. 4667, the disaster relief supplemental appropriations which passed in response to the three hurricanes which ravaged the United States in 2017.  
Additionally, I secured a $100 million dollars that will be used throughout the state to help small businesses impacted by Hurricane Harvey. And for the first time, those dollars will be given as a grant and not a loan.  And in order to encourage excellence in our school districts, I have provided congressional recognition for all of the graduating seniors in my congressional district and provided opportunities for scholarships, internships, and international exchange programs.

Speaking out Against the Administration's Policy of Separating Families 
￼ 
Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee speaking out against the Administration's policy of separating families
At the forefront of everyone’s minds has been the ""zero-tolerance"" policy of family separation carried out by the current Administration. Congresswoman Jackson Lee, as the Founder and Chair of the Children’s Caucus, has taken a leading role in ameliorating this devastating situation. As a member of the Women's Working Group, she has been to the border several times, visited detention centers and witnessed children separated from their families. She was able to visit family detention centers at the border in Texas last month and witness first-hand the horrific conditions these children and their families were forced to endure. She also witnessed the government's attempt at reunification where some of the children seem to not recognize their own families.  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee was a leading original sponsor of H.R. 6135, wrote many letters to the Department of Justice, Homeland Security, and to the President of the United States seeking credible relief for these families and argued against these parents being denied access to asylum who crossed legally through ports of entry.  Congresswoman Jackson Lee introduced comprehensive immigration reform over several terms in Congress to create a legal pathway to citizenship. It is important for Congress to establish real policies that create an immigration system that works for the betterment of our country and for the security of the American people. 
  
Holding the Department of Justice Accountable on Investigating Russian Election Interference 
  
￼  
Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee questions FBI Agent Peter Strzok at a joint hearing before the House Judiciary Committee and the Oversight and Government Reform Committee about Russian interference in the 2016 Election. 
Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee is the ranking member and first female member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations. She has been focused on a myriad issues including providing security for those fleeing unimaginable conditions in their home countries.  Congresswoman Jackson Lee introduced H.R. 6325, Continuing American Safety Act (CASA).  This bill would extend the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program until January 21, 2021 for all countries currently listed in the program and adds Guatemala to the list of countries whose citizens may be eligible for TPS. On June 3, 2018, Guatemala was devastated by a volcanic eruption, resulting in many of its citizens not being able to safely return to their now destroyed homes. Congresswoman Jackson Lee is also very concerned about foreign meddling in our democracy, which is why she believes it is important to support the Special Counsel’s investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 election.  This led to the her introduction of H.R. 3654, the Special Counsel Independence Protection Act which drew the support of over 150 cosponsors and forms a major basis of H.R. 5476, the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act (“SCIIA”), which has already been favorably reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  If enacted into law, the SCIIA would permit any special counsel terminated to challenge the action in federal court and would only permit removal for cause.
Working to End Gun Violence 
  
Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee recognizes the severity of the gun violence crisis in the United States. As of July 2018, there have been nearly 30,000 violent incidents involving firearms with over 7,300 fatalities. The issue of gun violence in this nation was brought close to home with the recent tragic shooting of two high schools, one in Texas near Houston and one in Florida. These communities experienced deep sadness from the loss of these victims. We are embracing these students and their families and are working for their safety and security. Congresswoman Jackson Lee has continued to advocate for the public health and safety of her constituents as well as those of Americans across the country. She is proud to have introduced H.R. 5088, the No More Atrocities with Guns Act (No MAGA).  This bill would raise the requisite age from 18 to 21 for the purchase or possession of semi-automatic assault weapons.  In October 2017, she introduced H.R. 4268, the “Gun Safety: Not Sorry Act,” in response to the Las Vegas mass shooting, which imposes a 7-day waiting period on all purchases of semi-automatic weapons, large capacity magazines, bump stocks, and other devices that automatize weapons. H.R. 5088 together with H.R. 4268 will help address this problem that uniquely afflicts the United States. She has pushed for expanding the resources available to law enforcement in H.R. 62 Gun Violence Reductions Resources Act, which authorizes the Department of Justice to hire 200 additional agents and investigators for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Furthermore, Congresswoman Jackson Lee supported expanding appropriations for the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Social Security Administration to increase access to mental health care treatment and services, and promote reporting of mental health information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. She will also be introducing legislation in the coming days to ban 3D guns.  This legislation will confront the proliferation of these types of weapons on two fronts: first, it will extend the current statutory prohibition on untraceable guns (guns without manufacturers’ serial numbers) to expressly include 3D-printed guns that, by definition do not have manufacturers’ serial numbers; and, second, the bill would proscribe the creation of these 3D guns. Congresswoman Jackson Lee is a strong believer in the Bill of Rights and as well in the importance of protecting Americans from gun violence.  She is unequivocally confident that such common-sense measures benefit our communities by ensuring that gun ownership in the United States is safer, accountable, and responsible. 
Protecting Women from Domestic Violence 
￼ 
Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee announces the introduction of H.R. 6545, the ""VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2018.""
Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee has worked with a broad cross-section of community stakeholder and advocacy groups to shepherd the introduction of H.R. 6545, the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (“VAWA”), which she introduced in the United States House of Representatives on July 26, 2018. Over 35 bipartisan advocacy groups worked with Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee to introduce this bill, and she was joined by Leader Nancy Pelosi, Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Jerry Nadler, and Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer.  H.R. 6545 preserves and expands housing protections for survivors; provides economic security assistance for survivors; helps prevent “intimate partner” homicides; enhances judicial and law enforcement tools; improves services for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; provides services, protection, and justice for young victims of violence; helps protect Native American women, by including provisions to improve the response to missing and murdered Native American women, improving tribal access to federal crime information databases, and reaffirming tribal criminal jurisdiction over non-Indian perpetrators of violence and assault; and protects the Office on Violence Against Women in the Department of Justice from being de-emphasized, merged, or consolidated into any other DOJ office.   It currently has the support of 115 members of Congress.  This proposal is the product of many, many months of input and when passed, will help to continue to protect women, educate communities, and enhance the tools that law enforcement can utilize to safeguard against the violence, abuse, and sexual harassment of women.  According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence and a violence prevention report promulgated by the Centers for Disease Control, one in four women will be the victim of severe domestic violence; one in seven have been stalked by their partner; one in five will be raped; and almost 20% of domestic violence includes a weapon. In Texas, the numbers are no less discouraging. According to recent statistics, the number of women killed by their intimate partners was 10% greater than the national rate.  Since its initial enactment a quarter-century ago, this critical law—through policy reforms, interstate cooperation and grant allocation—has been pivotal in providing a national response to protecting half of the population. Equally important, it has ushered in a seismic transformation on how society perceives violence against women. This progress cannot be allowed to stop.  
 Fighting to Preserve Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security
￼ 
Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee at an official press conference as a Member of the House Budget Committee calls for support of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security
Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee has always been a staunch supporter of protecting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits for her constituents.  She supports an annual increase in the cost of living adjustment (COLA) and in those instances where the COLA does not occur, she has introduced H.R. 67, the Social Security Safety Dividend Act of 2017, which would provide $250 to seniors in the event there is no COLA under the existing formula.  She is also a co-sponsor of the Social Security 2100 Act, which expands benefits for all current and future social security recipients; cuts taxes for 10 million seniors; and ensures the system remains solvent for the rest of this century.   Congresswoman Jackson Lee also fought attempts to privatize Medicaid and deny funds to Medicare.  In June 2018, she introduced an amendment to restore federal funding to Medicaid to ensure children, pregnant women, seniors, disabled people, and low-income adults can continue to access comprehensive and affordable coverage. The Congresswoman recognizes the central role Medicaid plays in Americans’ lives, and she demonstrated her commitment to this belief by introducing this amendment that: rejects cuts and policies harmful to vulnerable populations; rejects converting Medicaid to a per-capita cap or block grant; rejects ending the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act; and rejects adding a work requirement for Medicaid. Furthermore, her amendment proposed protecting Medicaid and changing lives for the better in a revenue neutral way by reducing tax expenditures for the Top 1%, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates will save $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
Conducting Oversight on Disaster Recovery in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands 
Recognizing the scale and impact of the deadly 2017 Hurricane Season, Congresswoman Jackson Lee traveled with a Congressional leadership delegation to assess the government's response to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Both are still suffering. Puerto Rico is still trying to restore power and the Virgin Islands is still trying to restore its tourist industry and housing. She believes the Administration's mismanagement of and response to this crisis revealed a wholesale incompetence, the results of which were sad, an affront to human dignity, and cost the lives of thousands of American citizens. We are currently in the ninth week of the 2018 Hurricane Season and this moment comes as many weeks after a report released by Harvard University, indicating that the true death toll from Hurricane Maria was 4,645, and not 64 as the Administration claimed, and therefore 70 times higher than previously reported. Congresswoman Jackson Lee believes that Congress must act now to ensure oversight of the Administration's management of rescue and recovery.  She will soon introduce legislation to reform FEMA, define responsibilities for its rescue duties, and create a separate FEMA office to deal with the economic recovery, housing recovery, healthcare recovery.  
Ensuring Fairness in International Sports 
As a leadership appointed member of the bicameral Helsinki Commission, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee introduced a bill to restore fairness in international sports. H.R. 6067, the “Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act” is named after Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the whistleblower who exposed the Russian state-sponsored doping operation in the 2014 Sochi Olympics. The proliferation of illegal performance-enhancing drugs (“PEDs”) in sports damages the integrity of competition and defrauds individuals and corporate entities who participate in sporting competitions, including clean U.S. athletes, U.S. corporate sponsors and companies, and banking institutions. By deceiving international anti-doping authorities and swapping athletes’ samples, Russian officials cheated U.S. athletes out of Olympic glory and U.S. corporations out of honest sponsorships.  During a recent Helsinki Commission hearing, Rodchenkov and another whistle-blower, Yulia Stepanova, said Russian athletes who participate in the doping program are essentially following orders, fearing that speaking out would mean the end of their careers, or possibly even lead to their deaths. ""You will lose your job, your career, and even fear for the safety of you and your family,"" said Stepanova, a former Russian track athlete. ""You will be called a liar and a traitor if you stand up against the system that unfortunately still exists in Russia today."" These corrupt officials used bribes and illicit payments, sometimes through U.S. financial institutions, to commit this fraud. To ensure that victims of doping fraud receive the justice they deserve, the bill establishes criminal penalties for knowingly manufacturing, distributing, and using PEDs, and applies to all major international competitions.  A level playing field is a better playing field.  

Improving Lives in the 18th Congressional District 
Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee believes Houstonians need a ""Better Deal"" for the future of poor and working families which includes a major 500 billion dollar infrastructure program included in H.R. 1664, the ""Investing in America: A Penny for Progress Act."" As a member of the Anti-Poverty Task Force and looking at the wealth of this country, Congresswoman Jackson Lee looks forward to crafting legislation to eliminate poverty and create more jobs with a major infrastructure rebuild of the nation's electric grid, dams, and highways, and a major effort to end corruption to restore integrity to our government, investment in education, providing access to college for all student who desire to attend, and protecting our seniors lifeline of Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security. A senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, Congresswoman Jackson Lee believes in implementing practical fiscal responsibility rather than making unfulfilled promises to the people of the 18th District of Texas and the American people. Congresswoman Jackson Lee believes the Administration's budget was out of touch and was therefore dead on arrival. Thereafter, Congresswoman Jackson Lee worked with colleagues in the House and the Senate and reached across the aisle and lifted the mandatory budget caps by $117 billion to nondefense discretionary spending programs, benefitting seniors, transportation and infrastructure, and other important priorities. The Congresswoman is pleased for the provisions of this budget which she believes will strengthen the lives of people in the 18th Congressional District of Texas. The FY18 Omnibus spending bill includes 21 Jackson Lee amendments that together increase investments in such critical areas as public health, education, flood control, transportation, child nutrition, criminal justice reform, and women’s rights. Through these measures, Congresswoman Jackson Lee ensures that your tax money will be spent responsibly and productively. Her pledge is for a better deal by creating millions more good jobs, raise incomes for American workers, and  building an economy that gives every American the tools to succeed in the 21st century.

8/8/18 22:57,What We Have Accomplished Together ,"￼


August 8, 2018



Dear Lindsey:   It has been an honor to serve you in the U.S. House of Representatives. I wanted to share some of what we have accomplished so far in the 115th Congress.    Cutting Taxes for Working Families From the Cedar Valley to Dubuque, the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a win for single parents, working families, and small business owners in northeast Iowa.   My criteria for tax reform has always been based upon these three goals: simplifying tax preparation for families, lowering taxes for the middle class, and reigniting our economy. Although I am not a supporter of every provision in this bill, it achieves all three of those criteria. The Tax Cut and Jobs Act has already begun to spur economic growth since President Trump signed it into law, as seen by the highest GDP growth since 2014, at 4.1%, which resulted in increased consumer confidence, historically low minority unemployment, and higher paychecks for workers.*  Many Iowans contacted my office through negotiations for provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I am very proud to have fought for these specific provisions that were included in the final bill text.  · Preserving Federal Historic Tax Credits · Retaining the Medical Expense Deduction · Establishing Renewable Wind Energy Production Credits · Providing Section 199 Deductions for Cooperatives and their Farmers 
￼
* GDP growth figure courtesy of the U.S. Department of Commerce   Protecting our Veterans  One of my favorite things about serving northeast Iowa in the U. S. House of Representatives is advocating for those who made sacrifices to preserve the liberties and freedoms we enjoy in the United States. As the son of a WWll veteran, I understand the importance of helping our brave men and women when they return from defending our nation.

￼

I am proud of the work we have done so far this Congress. We have taken steps to improve the overall experience for veterans at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), ensure that they have better access to healthcare and extended benefits to their spouses.

￼
 Securing Flood Wall Funding for Cedar Rapids  I am pleased to announce that my top priority - securing federal funding for the Cedar Rapids flood wall - has come to fruition. After ten years, the Army Corps of Engineers recently announced that $117 million has finally been appropriated to build the needed infrastructure in Cedar Rapids to protect from future flooding disasters. 
￼
From my first day in Congress, I have worked to build relationships in Washington to help move the Cedar Rapids flood protection project forward. After facing some headwinds my first two years, a breakthrough with the Army Corps of Engineers and the Trump Administration was achieved, when they actively partnered with myself and the Iowa delegation to bring real results for Iowa and Cedar Rapids.  I am pleased that we have secured $117 million from the federal government to complete the flood wall project. Here is what that means for the residents of Cedar Rapids. Along with local and state funds, the federal government is ensuring that downtown Cedar Rapids is protected.  · Approximately 7 miles long · Combination of permanent flood walls, removable walls, levees and gates · Includes up to 13 pump stations and detention basins to protect against rainwater flooding as pipes close  · Designed to convey the same water volume as the flood of 2008 · Removable floodwall gates at streets and railroad crossing  · Raises the 8th Avenue bridge to above the 2008 flood volume and will provide an additional emergency route across the river during future flooding events · Offers permanent protection to downtown Cedar Rapids giving local businesses confidence in being in Cedar Rapids  Protecting Cedamolr Rapids from future flooding disasters has been among my highest priorities; for this reason, I am pleased to have secured the funding to complete this project. If you have any questions regarding this process or our efforts, please feel to reach out to any of my offices in Iowa or D.C.  Passage of the 2018 Farm Bill 
Congressman Blum touring the Reckers' farm in Dyersville and discussing the 2018 Farm Bill 

￼
The U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 on June 21, 2018, and the U.S. Senate version passed on June 28, 2018. Currently, my colleagues and I are working to resolve any differences between the two bills and come out with a final product that protects farmers and their diverse needs.  After visiting many farms and speaking with countless stakeholders throughout the First District, I know the importance of providing our farming communities with certainty over the next five years by passing the 2018 Farm Bill.  This farm bill will provide vital programs to our farming communities in the First District, including maintaining a strong crop insurance program- a critical risk management program that ensures farmers can stay in business after tough years. Additionally, this bill makes needed changes to the commodity and the dairy programs to help producers struggling after a 50% decrease in farm income over the past five years.  The farm bill prioritizes conservation dollars to return the most water quality benefits without unduly competing against farmers for good rental ground, increases access to rural mental health services and encourage expansion of rural broadband infrastructure.  This legislation will reform the TANF and SNAP programs, requiring able-bodied, mentally stable, 18-59 year-old individuals to obtain a job or begin work-training to continue receiving benefits after a three-month window of unemployment. I believe TANF and SNAP programs should always be available for the disabled and the elderly, and I want to be clear- this bill does not remove benefits for those individuals.   Many Iowans depend on programs like SNAP to get them back on their feet after a difficult period in their lives. I believe in helping our neighbors when they have fallen on hard times and, as your Representative in Congress, will work to protect vital programs that assist Iowans.   Our farmers in Iowa can feed the world if we remove burdensome regulations and open markets. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in Congress and the Administration to keep improving the landscape for our farmers.   Working Hard for our Seniors  I'd like to give you an update on what my colleagues and I have done to improve the lives of seniors in northeast Iowa.   Here is a list of actions I have championed and supported during the 115th Congress:  
Congressman Blum discussing social security solvency with a northeast Iowan

￼

I hold tremendous respect for our senior community and I believe these measures will go a long way to protect them. I am committed to continuing to fight for our seniors and protecting their benefits.
Draining the Swamp  When I was sworn in, I made a commitment to preserve the integrity that Iowans demand of their public officials and to drain the swamp in Washington. Members of Congress are civil servants entrusted to be good stewards of taxpayer funds and should not benefit or have special treatment due to their position. That is why I introduced a package of legislation that is aimed at reversing the status quo of Congressional Members receiving special treatment at the taxpayer's expense.   To promote fiscal responsibility within Congress, I returned over 20% of my office's Congressional budget to the U.S. Treasury Department in the amount to $275,000. It is these kinds of actions that I believe Members of Congress should carry out to set an example of how to properly manage the funds entrusted to us, not wasting them on frivolous amenities.

Dear Friend,   
Securing our nation’s borders is the most basic and fundamental responsibility of Congress as it seeks to uphold its Constitutional obligation to provide for national defense.  Compelling congressional testimony informs us that known terrorists and dangerous Special Interest Aliens are seeking to reach our borders through illicit pathways.  This is a very tangible threat, not a hypothetical scenario.  According to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, “We have also seen ISIS, in written materials encourage its followers to cross our southwest borders, given the loopholes that they are also aware of.”  She added that the government has prevented over 3,700 known terrorists in the past year from entering the United States.  The U.S. military has confirmed her assertions.  When I served as Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee’s Subcommittee on Management, Investigations, and Oversight, I h! ad the opportunity to personally visit the southwest border and see with my own eyes how easy it is to cross at will.  This has to change, which is why I have consistently supported funding for border security.  H.R. 3219, which passed the House with my support, fully funds the President’s request for border security at $1.6 billion.  However, this measure was not able to pass the Senate.  The Omnibus budget bill, which I did vote for this spring, was signed into law and did include a down payment on border security.  Construction and repair work has already begun.  The Securing America’s Future Act, which I have co-sponsored, also authorizes funding for border security as well as reform of our immigration system.  In addition to strengthening border security, I voted in favor of Kate’s law, which enhances penalties for criminal aliens who unlawfully return to the United States after being deported. I also supported H.R. ! 3003! , the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, which Strengthens laws to combat dangerous sanctuary cities policies that shield criminals from federal prosecution and deportation. These sanctuary cities are releasing violent criminals, including MS-13 gang members back into communities.  I am very proud of our own Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, who spearheaded the effort between the Sheriff’s Association and ICE to reach a Constitutionally-sound compromise between local law enforcement and ICE on the detainment of those with ICE warrants. He deserves a great deal of credit for his national leadership on this issue. 
Recently, I had an encouraging meeting with the White House legislative team. The Administration is enthusiastic about my Student Visa Security Improvement Act. This bill will ensure that foreign students who come here on student visas, and the universities that they attend, are held accountable. Tens of thousands of foreign students drop out of school, overstay their visas, and go missing with little effort to track them. This has to stop. After nearly 10 years of trying to work with other administrations, I am proud that this White House supports my common sense legislation. 
Border security and immigration reform will undoubtedly continue to be part of the national conversation I look forward to working with my colleagues on these very important issues in a respectful and cooperative manner. However, whichever path forward we agree upon, I will be honoring my commitment to prioritize the following:  securing our nation's borders, ending chain migration, ensuring visas are distributed based upon merit and finding a compassionate way to ensure that children who were brought to this country illegally, through no fault of their own, do not continue to be punished for the actions of others. Additionally, I want to ensure that families who come here are kept together and that those who have been separated are safely reunited as quickly as possible.  I have been and will continue to closely monitor this delicate situation.  I know this is an issue about which many people in our community feel passionately and have strong disag! reement.  Someone recently reminded me that the language we use in framing our message has a tremendous impact upon the manner in which it is received.  I try to keep that in mind as I work to build consensus on these sensitive issues.  Treating everyone with respect, while providing for the safety and security of those I represent will continue to guide my decision-making. 
Sincerely,
￼ 
Gus Bilirakis

August 8, 2018  Dear Mrs.  : 
On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the first major tax reform in nearly 30 years.  As a member of the Committee on Ways and Means, which has jurisdiction over tax legislation, I am proud to have helped draft this legislation.  I worked to keep in place provisions vital to Nebraskans such as the deduction for property taxes for farmers, ranchers, and small businesses.  I encourage you to share your thoughts with me on how tax reform is working so far, and how we can improve the tax code further going forward.  Our second round of tax reform, dubbed “Tax Reform 2.0,” will focus on making individual and small business provisions of H.R. 1 permanent, while improving incentives for families to save and for entrepreneurs to start new businesses.  I will be holding three roundtables across the Third District for small businesses, including farmers and ranchers, to update you on my work and ask for your input as I continue to work to improve the federal tax code.  Monday, August 13, 2018  Weborg 21 Centre, Hospitality Room 2625 10th Street, Gering 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. MDT 
Wednesday, August 15, 2018  Central Community College, Room 131 1215 30th Avenue, Kearney 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. CDT

8/8/18 20:32,Delivering results for Lower Hudson Valley residents,"￼
ABOUT NITA           CONSTITUENT SERVICES           NEWSROOM           LEGISLATIVE ISSUES           17th DISTRICT           CONTACT ME 
Dear Friend:
My top priority in Congress is serving my constituents in New York's 17th Congressional District, including assisting with federal government agencies, consumer protection issues, and federal grant opportunities.  
To give you a better sense of the ways in which we are able to help, here are just some of the many results we have achieved for constituents: 
	•	Securing a home health aide for a local World War II veteran. A World War II veteran from Harrison was approved by the Veterans Administration (VA) for a home health aide, but after several months no one suitable was found to fill the job. At his daughter's request, I sent an inquiry to the VA, which then expanded its search. A candidate was hired, and the veteran now has the companion care he needs.  
	•	Ensuring a constituent received his Social Security benefits. A Rockland man contacted me because his father hadn't received a check for Social Security benefits for more than a year. The Social Security Administration was aware of the lapse but was not taking action. I sent an inquiry to Social Security asking to expedite the processing of the payment. After I followed up with SSA, he received the full amount owed, some $65,000.  
	•	Securing SNAP benefits for a White Plains resident. A White Plains man contacted me because he was approved for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) but had not received the assistance. I sent an inquiry to the Westchester County Department of Social Services and, after following up, received confirmation he would receive his benefits for the current month as well as for the eight prior months that were missed.  
	•	Helping a New City resident enroll in health insurance. A New City resident contacted my office because she was having problems enrolling in a health insurance plan through the New York Health Exchange. She was told by the exchange that she needed to submit additional information that she had already provided. Soon after I sent an inquiry to the exchange with the requested information attached, the New City resident was able to enroll in a health plan.   
	•	Helping a local reservist secure a higher pay grade. The Army was taking a long time to evaluate a Buchanan reservist's bachelor's degree, which would make him eligible for a higher pay grade. I made an inquiry and shortly thereafter he was informed that his degree had been accepted and his pay raised.   
	•	Securing necessary medication for an Ossining resident. An Ossining resident contacted my office after her health insurance provider denied coverage for heart medication she needed. The woman's  doctor had diagnosed her with heart failure and recommended that she go on the medication until she was well enough for a heart transplant. The doctor provided a medical necessity letter, but the insurance provider again denied the claim. After sending an inquiry to the insurance company, my office was informed that the medication would be covered in full.   
	•	Securing a refund from Medicare for a Pleasantville resident. A Pleasantville resident contacted my office because he believed he had been overbilled by Medicare for his monthly premium. Soon after sending an inquiry to Medicare, I was informed that the resident had received a refund of $730.   
	•	Securing Medals for a Tarrytown WWII Army Veteran. More than 70 years ago, Tarrytown resident Leon Gutherz served as a paratrooper in World War II, making 12 jumps throughout his distinguished career in the Army. His neighbor contacted me to help ensure he is properly honored for his service in defense of our great nation. After working with the National Archives and Records Administration, I was proud to award Mr. Gutherz six medals, including the World War II Victory Medal and the Philippine Liberation Medal.  
	•	Helping a Rockland woman retain health insurance. A Rockland woman contacted me because soon after she enrolled in health insurance through the New York Health Exchange, she was told she did not qualify for the plan. She tried to contact the Exchange, but by the time she was able to speak with someone, the open enrollment period had passed. I contacted the Exchange, and she was successfully enrolled in a new plan with no gap in coverage.  
	•	Helping a Westchester resident receive missing Social Security checks. A Westchester woman contacted me on behalf of her late mother's estate. She said that near the end of her life, her mother closed her bank account and asked Social Security (SSA) to deposit her checks in a new one she recently had opened. For four months SSA continued to send money to the closed account. I sent an inquiry to SSA and was told additional documentation was needed to prove the constituent's relationship to her mother. I forwarded the documents to SSA, and, after following up, I was told SSA released $12,023.10 to cover payments not received when her mother was alive.  
	•	Helping a local woman resolve passport roadblocks. A constituent contacted me on behalf of his wife, who needed to obtain a passport for a trip the couple was taking for medical purposes. She only had a hospital-issued birth certificate, which does not qualify as a valid form of identification to get a passport. I contacted the New York City Department of Health, which was able to find the long-form birth certificate that is required, and made her an appointment at the Connecticut passport office. She received her passport just in time for the scheduled trip.
I hope that you find this information helpful and are encouraged to contact us for any needed assistance. If you have questions or need assistance, please contact my office in Westchester County at (914) 428-1707, Rockland County at (845) 639-3485, or Washington, D.C., at (202) 225-6506, and we will do all we can to help.

Rep. Bergman Meets With Mine Leaders and Workers About Past and Upcoming Legislative Concerns

￼ ￼ ￼ 

In the 18 months I’ve been in Congress, my number one goal as your Representative has been to help residents of Michigan’s First District live the life they choose, while keeping the federal government out of your pocket and off your back. 

So far, we’ve made great strides to do just that. Since taking office, we’ve rolled back taxes for most Americans, cut bureaucratic red-tape, and provided more safety for our schools and communities. 
Safer Schools – Strong Communities 
As we approach a new school year, our focus remains on keeping our schools safe so our children can go to school without fear of threats and danger.  This is not a partisan issue. The 115th Congress has helped create a safer environment by passing the STOP School Violence Act, which created new funding for school threat assessment and crisis intervention teams, as well as funding for technology and equipment to improve school security and prevent attacks.
To strengthen our community, we’ve passed over 50 pieces of legislation to help combat the opioid crisis in the past 18 months in Congress. The opioid epidemic has ravaged our nation, and unfortunately the First District is no exception. Republicans have taken on this crisis directly and have provided over $32 Million in federal aid to the state of Michigan to help end this crisis.    
 Lower Taxes – Stronger workforce
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was one of the most momentous pieces of legislation that we’ve worked through in the 115th Congress. This historic tax legislation reduced tax rates for most Americans and simplified our tax code to help American families and companies compete. This is great news for Michigan families,and it has already helped most in Michigan’s First District see more money in their paycheck.
Just recently, President Trump Signed the “Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act” into law. One of the many needs of employers all throughout the District is the need for qualified labor. This bill supports career and technical education, giving states and local communities more flexibility to design career education programs.
Supporting our Military and Veterans
As a combat Veteran and a Marine General, our national security and Veteran care are top priorities of mine. We’ve cut the red-tape within VA, replaced the VA Choice program, and have made major strides to provide the best care for those who have sacrificed so much for our great nation. 
After years of inaction and decreased military strength, the 115th Congress has focused on building a stronger military. We’re upgrading our military's weapons, equipment and readiness. We’ve secured money to rebuild our depleting naval fleet, and are ensuring our country and our allies are safe.
I’m looking forward to accomplishing more for the First District in the days and weeks ahead.
Sincerely, Jack Bergman

Dear Friend,  
Last night, my staff and I went to over a dozen National Night Out events throughout the 10th District.  National Night Out is a community building event that bring together neighbors and the officers who serve and protect them and is an important tool to build trust between law enforcement and local communities they serve.  
Every year, we attend National Night Out events across Virginia’s 10th District as part of our ongoing efforts to join with our communities and thank our law enforcement.  My legislation, the Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act, which supports community policing efforts, was signed into law on June 18, 2018.  Below are some of the events that we joined with our neighbors across the district.    
Manassas Park  We started this year’s National Night Out in Manassas Park. This is a great family night thanks to all the local, state, and federal first responders participating.  
￼ 
South Riding  We joined Loudoun Sheriff Mike Chapman in South Riding.  This is the 35th year of National Night Out where the community comes together with our first responders.  
￼ 
Manassas  I joined Manassas Councilman Ian Lovejoy at Georgetown South's National Night Out. Thanks to Manassas City Police Department for hosting. We visited with the community and teachers from Mayfield as well. 
￼
Staff enjoyed National Night Out at the Manassas Museum where we had a Mobile Office for constituents. 
￼ 
Clifton  My staff joined the Clifton community at Little Rocky Run to honor Fairfax Police Department including Officer Kuhar and Officer Kinkead as part of National Night Out, a celebration of America's police forces and first responders.  
￼ 
Ashburn  Staff had a great time at One Loudoun with the Loudoun Sheriff’s Office at National Night Out talking about their Project Lifesaver which assists in finding the elderly and those with special needs who have been lost and are in distress, as well as the benefits of the thumb-scanner technology that has been funded through Project Safe Neighborhoods.  
￼ 
Middleburg  My staff visited with the Middleburg Police Department and spoke with Mayor Littleton, town council members, former mayor Betsy Davis, Ram Venkatachalam, and saw council member Peter Leonard-Morgan in the dunk tank and Chief of Police AJ Panebianco dancing to Stayin’ Alive.  
￼ 
Centreville  Staff visited Virginia Run last night with officers from the Fairfax Sheriff’s office.  
￼ 
Berryville  My staff joined with Chairman Weiss, Sheriff Tony Roper, and Commonwealth’s Attorney Anne Williams for fun in Berryville. 
￼
Purcellville A great crowd gathered in Purcellville with my staff and local law enforcement for last night’s National Night Out Event.    
￼ 
Fairfax Station  Staff met with Fairfax Police, Delegate Tim Hugo, and Supervisor Pat Herrity in Fairfax Station for National Night Out Festivities.

Poll: Reforming Washington
Hoosiers, 
 
Reforming a broken Washington continues to be my top priority in Congress, which is why this week, I cosponsored H.J.Res. 134, a new resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to limit the number of terms an individual can serve as a Member of Congress. Term limits for Members of Congress are essential to ensuring Washington, D.C. is here to serve Americans and put the interests of the people first, which is why I have supported every term limit bill in the House of Representatives. Click here to read more about why I support term limits and the bill I introduced. 
 
Question of the Week: As we work to reform a broken Washington, which is your highest priority?

[_] Term limits for Congress.
[_] Lobbying ban on former Members of Congress.
[_] Reduce duplicative regulations.
[_] A Balanced Budget Amendment.
[_] Ending short term spending bills.
[_] All of the above.
[_] I don't know.
[_] Other (share your thoughts). 

Take the poll here.

NEWS FROM WASHINGTON AND ACROSS WEST TEXAS
Dear Friend, 
As I visit with many of you in West Texas, our conversations continue to center around the 2018 Farm Bill. It is single-handedly the most important legislation for our region, and we MUST get it right for our hardworking agriculture producers.  
Farm Bill Priorities 
Recently, I sat down to discuss my priorities for the 2018 Farm Bill. You can watch the full video here. It is imperative we pass a strong Farm Bill that includes an even stronger safety net for our ag producers, making sure our farmers and ranchers have the risk management tools to stabilize the ag economy. 
￼ 
In addition, with over 70% of the Farm Bill’s funding going to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), we need policies that encourage work, stop trapping people in the cycle of government dependence, and fill the millions of surplus jobs in America – 7 million to be exact. It’s time for folks to get off the sidelines - it’s not just good for taxpayers and our economy, it’s the right thing to do for folks who are recipients of food stamps. We want folks to realize their God-given, fullest potential, and we need the right policies to incentivize the right behavior. See Wall Street Journal’s article here on our workforce needs. 
Seed Cotton Program 
Cotton farmers are protected under Title I for the first time since the 2014 Farm Bill. Earlier this year, an effort led by Chairman Conaway passed through Congress that restored cotton to the agriculture safety net, a solution we had long been fighting for. You can’t overstate the importance of cotton to West Texas, and by restoring its safety net status, we are able to save billions of dollars to our local economy and ensure a prosperous future for families living on the South Plains. Read FOX34’s write up on the announcement here. 
Energy Dominance 
Due to the pro-American energy policies pursued by the 115th Congress and under President Trump’s leadership, the energy sector is growing at a rapid rate and will make the United States a net energy exporter by 2022, according to the Energy Department. In an op-ed for CNBC, former Texas Governor and Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry stated, “by all accounts, the United States is in the midst of truly spectacular progress in the vital realm of energy. Spurred by technological breakthroughs unleashed by innovation, deregulation and pro-growth policies, we are now producing energy more abundantly and affordably, using it more cleanly and efficiently, and obtaining it from a wider range of sources than anyone ever thought possible.” See his full op-ed here. 
Not only is our energy sector helping to grow our economy and strengthen our national security, it is employing millions of hard-working Americans. The U.S. Energy and Employment Report for 2017 showed that over 6 million Americans are employed in the energy sector, many of them right here in the energy basin of the United States, West Texas. 
With this week being American Wind Week, I want to thank all our hardworking energy producers for making our economy in District 19 strong and prosperous. 
New Command at Dyess 
Col. Jeffery T. Menasco became commander of the 317th Airlift Wing at Dyess last week. Please join me in congratulating him as he takes the helm of this elite fighting force. With his experience and leadership, he will surely lead our Airmen at Dyess well. Read more about his history with the Air Force in the Abilene Reporter-News article here. 
Please know, it is an honor to be your Representative. Feel free to reach out to my office and let me know how I can best serve you.

Dear Friend, 

We are settling into the August work period and I have considered it my privilege to visit numerous places throughout the district. I wanted to update you on a few of the visits and what is happening throughout Virginia's 7th. 

Kicking Off Mobile Office Hours 

On Friday I met with 30 constituents from Louisa and Goochland counties as part of a series of mobile office hours I am doing in all 10 counties of the 7th District this August. 

          ￼     ￼
￼

On Tuesday and Wednesday, I met with constituents from Powhatan, Chesterfield, Nottoway and Amelia. During the meetings, every constituent who requested it, regardless of their political views, was able to have an open-ended dialogue with me about any issue or issues of their choosing.

                            ￼    ￼

            ￼    ￼ 
I am grateful for everyone who took time out of their busy schedules to meet with me and express their views, even though many disagreed with me. These meetings give me a critically important opportunity to have a civil exchange of ideas with people on a variety of issues. I encourage everyone to sign up for my email newsletter to hear directly from me. I will continue to uphold my commitment to travel extensively throughout the 7th District to listen to my constituents, so that I can better represent you in Congress.
Listening to Job Creators and their Employees 

On Monday, Rep. Meadows and I had the privilege of meeting with Charlie Luck and Doug Palmore of Luck Stone Corporation in Goochland. We discussed which transportation regulations have been helpful for the industry and which regulations have been harmful. And we had a thoughtful exchange of ideas for transportation legislation that Congress could consider.
     ￼
     ￼

I also attended a business roundtable with Associated Builders and Contractors in Henrico. It is these types of meetings that give me valuable insight into how I can best represent businesses in Congress. 

            ￼     ￼
 
Tuesday, I had the pleasure of visiting Moslow Wood Products in Powhatan. Businesses like Moslow are the heartbeat of our local economy. Thank you for letting me visit and learn more about what you do.

            ￼    ￼
  
            ￼    ￼

Connie and Brad Cooper opened the doors of their family owned and operated business, Steam Bell Brewery in Chesterfield to me and shared how they followed their dream and became successful owners of one of the coolest spots in town.

           ￼    ￼
   
Stay in Touch  
I am always interested in hearing your thoughts. If you have any comments, questions, or concerns, you can contact me directly by clicking here or by calling my office at (202) 225-2815.
You can also follow me on Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube for updates on my work in Congress.

8.8.18 Cleaning Up the Chesapeake Bay
Dear Friend, 
The Chesapeake Bay is a jewel for Virginia and the region – home to some of our most unique communities and most beautiful scenic areas and wildlife, as well as to thousands of jobs in the tourism and fishery industries. I’ve worked to improve the health of this important body of water because a clean Chesapeake Bay is good for the environment and good for the economy.
After years of supporting Chesapeake Bay cleanup, I’m proud that we recently passed a bipartisan bill that provides continued funding for the Chesapeake Bay Program, a vital effort to restore the Bay. The bill also supports the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which has helped preserve Chesapeake Bay lands and waters, as well as forests, trails, and wildlife refuges across Virginia.  
Read more about the bill here >>
Please know that I won’t stop working to protect Virginia’s environment for future generations to enjoy. 

Sincerely,
￼
Senator Tim Kaine

Congressional Update
 

Dear Fellow Texan,

As your Representative in Congress, I am writing to provide an additional update regarding the work being done in the U.S. House of Representatives. Folks back home in “real-world” Texas watch or read the daily news and probably think that Washington is broken and dysfunctional. While it may seem that way, the facts indicate that the past few months have been among the most productive in Congressional history. Even though my time in Congress has been fairly short, the 115th Congress (2017-2018) has produced more positive change than the prior three Congresses. During the 19-month period ending in July, we passed over 200 pieces of legislation which have become law (i.e., passed House, passed Senate, and signed by President Trump), over 98% of which have been bipartisan. These laws are intended to address real-world challenges for 21st century America. We are pleased to share some of those activities with you in this letter.

In addition to our efforts to grow our economy, to improve our national security, and to create more opportunity for all, we have been working to make our communities safer, to promote healthy families, to create more affordable health care choices, and to support our nation’s veterans. As we continue to work through the second year of this Congress, our priorities will continue to focus on building a renewed sense of confidence in America that restores our Promise, Prosperity, and Safety for current and future generations.

Better Off Now
Two years ago, House Republicans laid out a bold policy agenda called A Better Way to tackle some of the biggest challenges of the day – National Security, Tax Reform, the Economy, Health Care, Poverty, and Restoring Constitutional Authority. Throughout this Congress, we have been working hard to deliver on our promises. As a result, America is stronger at home and abroad, with a booming economy, safer communities, a more secure border, and a revived military.
 
Thanks to our bold, pro-growth tax reform and regulatory reform, unemployment is at historic lows, job openings are at record highs, paychecks are bigger, wages are rising, consumer confidence has dramatically improved, and economic optimism is growing. We have made significant investments to combat the opioid crisis, end human trafficking, target dangerous criminals, and make our schools safer. We have launched a historic rebuild of our military, raised pay for our troops, and made reforms within the Veterans Administration (VA) to provide better care for our veterans. The worldwide threat from ISIS has been largely eliminated, our allies know that we have their backs, and our enemies know that we will defend our families and our friends.

The American economy is soaring and is creating record levels of job opportunities for everyone, including women, Hispanics, African-Americans, and recent graduates. Our policies are making it easier for families to get ahead with a renewed sense of confidence in the future for their children and grandchildren. Because of these policies, designed to build a sustainable and durable 21st century economy, hardworking Texas families are better off. To learn more about the work we have done, please visit BetterOffNow.gop.

Stopping Human Trafficking
Each year, millions of boys and girls are manipulated into prostitution, domestic servitude, or other types of forced labor due to the global epidemic of human trafficking. In response to this challenge, Congress has passed over a dozen bipartisan bills to fight back against this scourge on our society. The Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, which was signed into law, enhances criminal penalties for websites that facilitate illegal prostitution or sex trafficking, and provides sex trafficking victims with options for restitution. The No Human Trafficking on Our Roads Act, which was also signed into law, disqualifies individuals from operating a commercial motor vehicle for their lifetime if they commit a human trafficking crime. The Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act reauthorizes federal funding to strengthen, expand, and create new initiatives to protect victims, prosecute traffickers, and prevent human trafficking. The Empowering Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act provides federal grant funding, so law enforcement can fight the demand for sex trafficking, and arrest those illegally soliciting sexual acts from abused victims. These bills have already had a positive impact in the fight against human trafficking due to the shutting down of major domestic internet websites that profited from trafficking and exploitation. Looking forward, it is imperative that Congress continue working on this issue to give our federal and local governments the tools they need to keep our communities safe. It is also crucial that we continue to support Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency that is on the frontlines intercepting violent gangs like MS-13, combating terrorism, investigating the flow of illegal narcotics, stopping human trafficking, and dismantling child exploitation operations.

Health Care
Throughout this Congress, the House has passed numerous bills to help lower costs and put hardworking American families in control of their health care decisions. In addition to implementing a fairer and simpler tax code, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated the Obamacare individual mandate tax penalty for not purchasing government-bureaucrat designed health insurance. The Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research Act, which has been signed into law, expands opportunities for childhood cancer research, improves efforts to identify and track childhood cancer incidences, and enhances the quality of life for childhood cancer survivors. The bipartisan Protect Medical Innovation Act permanently repeals Obamacare’s medical device tax, which will help create jobs, promote research, and allow for innovation that could lead to the next generation of lifesaving medical technologies. The bipartisan Increasing Access to Lower Premium Plans and Expanding Health Savings Accounts Act expands choice and access to lower cost health care options and gives families and individuals incentive to contribute pre-tax dollars to use for their health care purchases. It also places a two-year delay on Obamacare’s health insurance tax, a tax that drives up costs of insurance for almost every American. The bipartisan Restoring Access to Medication and Modernizing Health Savings Accounts Act transforms and modernizes health savings accounts and allows for more innovation in health care delivery. The bipartisan Small Business Health Fairness Act allows small businesses to band together through association health plans in order to purchase quality health care for their employees at a lower cost. The Right to Try Act, which has been signed into law, expands access to experimental treatments for patients with terminal diseases or conditions. The House will continue working to develop 21st century health care solutions that lower costs, encourage competition, and empower hardworking American families to take control of their health care decisions.

Veterans
The federal government’s primary responsibility is to provide for our common defense. This mission includes the care and support for veterans who have selflessly sacrificed to defend our nation, our families, and our way of life. To honor this commitment, the House has been working to improve the lives of our veterans by ensuring that they have access to the care and resources they have earned, and to bring increased accountability to the VA. The bipartisan Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act provides the resources to modernize the VA’s electronic health record system, improves mental health care services, strengthens opioid abuse prevention, expands rural veterans’ health initiatives, and strengthens numerous oversight and accountability measures to ensure that your taxpayer dollars are being used to best serve our veterans. The bipartisan Harry W. Colmery Veterans Education Assistance Act, which has been signed into law, updates GI Bill benefits for a 21st century economy by strengthening the opportunities available to veterans and their families. The VA Mission Act, which has been signed into law, extends funding for the Veterans Choice Program, which is an important program that allows veterans to receive care from a local health care provider of their choice. This bill also streamlines VA community care programs and expands the Post-9/11 Caregiver Program to cover veterans from all eras. The VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which has been signed into law, strengthens whistleblower protections and streamlines the disciplinary and removal process for poor employee performance and misconduct.

The 17th Congressional District is home to tens of thousands of veterans, veteran-related facilities, and colleges and universities that work closely with the VA. I recently rejoined the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee after previously serving on the committee from 2011 through 2014. The Veterans’ Affairs Committee has a strong history of bipartisanship; and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that our veterans have access to the care and resources they have earned, and to bring increased accountability and transparency to the VA. Together, we can build a 21st century VA that provides our nation’s veterans with the best possible care and prioritizes their interests.

Combating the Opioid Epidemic
The opioid epidemic is rampant across some parts of our country. It knows no boundaries, does not discriminate, and it ruins communities, families, and lives. Every day more than 100 Americans die from an opioid overdose, and more than 1,000 Americans are treated for opioid abuse. To help combat this epidemic, the House recently passed over 50 bipartisan bills as part of the comprehensive and bipartisan Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act. These bills focus on treatment and recovery, prevention and education, protecting our communities, and fighting the growing use of fentanyl – a synthetic drug that is easy and cheap to manufacture illegally. While these bills provide the tools needed to help combat this growing crisis, we must continue to work with all stakeholders and remain vigilant to put an end to this crippling epidemic once and for all.

Protecting Life and Promoting Healthy Families
Our families are the foundation of our country, and America is strong when our nation’s families are strong. As such, the House has been working to protect life and promote healthy families. The Bipartisan Budget Act, which was signed in to law, extended funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for an unprecedented 10 years. This bill also extended funding for Community Health Centers, which play an important role in delivering primary care and prenatal care to our most vulnerable populations. Through the use of the Congressional Review Act, we repealed the previous administration’s rule that mandated states to give Title X funding to abortion providers. The bipartisan Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act protects babies who survive an attempted abortion. The bipartisan No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act ensures that the federal government is not using taxpayer dollars to take innocent lives or provide insurance coverage that would. The bipartisan Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act limits abortions starting at 20 weeks of pregnancy, the point at which medical science indicates that an unborn child can feel pain. Additionally, the Bipartisan Budget Act included my bill, the Youth Empowerment Act, which modernizes and reauthorizes abstinence education programs so that our nation’s youths are given the information they need to make healthy decisions that will put them on the path to success. I firmly believe that life is sacred and will continue to support legislation that grows healthy families and protects the rights of the unborn.

Working Hard for the 17th Congressional District of Texas
Since the beginning of the 115th Congress in January 2017, our office has held 11 town hall events with over 40,000 folks participating. These events provide a 21st century tool for representative government and allow us to get constituent feedback on issues, answer questions, and provide updates on what is happening in Washington. The cumulative real-time responses received from participants during these events show that over 75% prefer this modern event format. In addition, I have engaged in over 300 face-to-face constituent meetings and events in the district, which have allowed me to interact with thousands of constituents. Team Flores has also responded to over 45,000 calls, emails, and faxes, and helped over 600 constituents interacting on their behalf with federal agencies. As your representative in Congress, my team and I are committed to serving the constituents of the 17th Congressional District and working to improve the Promise, Prosperity, and Safety of all hardworking Texas families.

In Closing
Please help me better represent you by getting your feedback on the important issues that our country faces. Also, I would appreciate you taking the time to visit my website at Flores.House.gov/survey to answer a survey about your priorities and thoughts regarding the work you think needs to be done in Washington. To stay updated on the work being done in Congress, you can follow me on social media, and visit my website — Flores.House.gov.

It is an honor to represent you in the United States Congress. Please feel free to contact me whenever I can be of assistance. I encourage each of you to continue praying for our country during these challenging times, and for our military men and women and first responders who protect us each day. 
With great respect,

          Before heading back to the Third District last week, I hosted a telephone town hall with almost 7,000 constituents. I would like to thank all of the folks who participated on the call as well as those who listened in. We covered a variety of topics including the results of tax reform, the importance of Yucca Mountain, President Trump’s Supreme Court nomination, voter ID laws, the VA MISSION Act, and how Congress is strengthening fishing communities. I received great feedback from the call, and I look forward to staying in touch as we push through these initiatives in the 115th Congress. If you were not able to be on the call this time, please feel free to email me with your comments and concerns, or sign up here if you’d like to be included in the next telephone town hall.  
￼  ￼ 
          Earlier in July I had the opportunity to visit Yucca Mountain in Nevada. I was able to post live video footage throughout my trip if you are interested in checking it out on my Facebook page. Also, here are a few links to news articles that further elaborate on my trip: 
	•	S.C. lawmakers tour Nevada’s Yucca 
	•	Duncan champions Yucca Mountain as site of nuclear repository
          In case you are unaware, Yucca Mountain is a permanent geological repository that is capable of storing our nation’s nuclear waste. However, it is not currently authorized for operation due to actions by the Obama Administration. This is very unfortunate because Yucca Mountain is a national solution to a national problem.
          Right now, there is nuclear waste sitting idle in 121 communities across 39 states. In South Carolina, we currently have over 4,500 tons of spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors. There are 4,147 canisters filled with vitrified glass waste and 10,000 tons of military and research nuclear waste sitting at the Savannah River Site ready to be shipped to Yucca Mountain. Further, the federal government has already made American ratepayers pay nearly $40 billion for the construction and operation of this site. South Carolina ratepayers alone have contributed over $1.5 billion to the Nuclear Waste Fund, as well as $1.6 billion in interest.
          I was proud when the House recently reaffirmed their commitment to making Yucca Mountain operational by passing the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act with a bipartisan vote of 340-72. The bill ensures that ratepayer money will not just continue to increase and fall into a bottomless pit. The federal government needs to completely follow through on this commitment, especially considering the American ratepayers have already paid for it. I hope the Senate will review this legislation as soon as possible so that we can finally make Yucca Mountain a reality. You can view my House floor speech on the legislation here.  
I’ve filed two new bills!  
          In the last few months, I felt called to file two new pieces of legislation. The first being the Old Glory Only Act, which requires the only flag to fly over American embassies and consular posts around the globe be Old Glory. The United States flag is the single greatest symbol of political freedom the world has ever known. For generations, it has served as a beacon to those around the world to look to American leadership to promote liberty and democracy. However, recently the State Department has allowed additional political flags to be flown over our U.S. embassies, which I believe muddies the message of our American freedom and fails to respect our nation’s great flag for the pure symbol that it is. To read the full text of my bill, click here. 
          The second bill I recently filed is the Eliminating Foreign Intervention in Elections Act. My bill aims to preserve the integrity of our American elections by ensuring that no federal money goes to localities that allow for noncitizens or illegal immigrants to vote in local or statewide elections. While this may seem like common sense to many, unfortunately it has become a growing issue. You may have recently heard that San Francisco has started to allow noncitizens and illegal immigrants to vote in school board elections. Chicago also allows noncitizens to vote in school board elections. Further, there are also multiple towns in Maryland that have been allowing this to happen for years. These states are completely disregarding American citizen’s right to vote and undermining our democracy. It is extremely important that we work together to change that. I will always remain devoted to protecting American citizen’s rights, therefore I will continue to encourage conversation on this issue so that my bill can be brought to the House floor as soon as possible. To read the full text of my bill, click here. 
          I am traveling all over the Third District during this August work period and am looking forward to seeing you folks! Also, as always, feel free to contact my D.C. office at 202-225-5301 with any legislative concerns; or my Anderson office at 864-224-7401 or Clinton office at 864-681-1028 for any casework issues you may need assistance with.

Greg's Treasure State Update
The economy just keeps growing and growing and growing... 

Our nation’s economy has turned another corner. 

According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, economic growth in the second quarter of 2018 reached 4.1 percent – the best pace in four years. This is in stark contrast to the average annual growth of 1.6 percent between 2009 and 2017. 

The economic policies of President Trump and congressional Republicans are working for Montana. I’m committed to building on this success and increasing opportunities for Montanans. 


Reducing barriers to business 

Small business is the engine that powers our strong economy. 

I recently sat down with the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, Loren Sweatt. We discussed ways the federal government can reduce unnecessary regulations that burden Montana businesses while keeping workplace safety a high priority. 

￼

Shining bright lights to put Montana first 

Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), who chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, tapped me to lead one of the committee’s subcommittees. As chairman of the Subcommittee on the Interior, Energy, and Environment (IEE), I am charged with oversight jurisdiction over USDA, Department of Energy, U.S. Forest Service, Department of Interior, BLM, and EPA. 

I’m using this important post to put Montana first, shining bright lights into these agencies to make sure they work for Montana. 

So far, we have held three hearings with more to come. In one hearing, we examined how forest service road closures impact public access to public lands. Kerry White, a legislator in the Montana House of Representatives, testified about road and trail closures on federal lands. 

Another explored ways to reduce barriers to opportunity so that tribes may develop their energy resources. Crow Tribal Chairman Alvin “A.J.” Not Afraid, Jr. testified on the excessive federal burdens the tribe faces in utilizing their resources. 

Another recent hearing examined how to preserve opportunities for grazing on federal land. Dillon-area rancher John Helle testified that environmental groups “are weaponizing statutes like the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)” to oppose multiple-use designations on public lands and threaten the viability of his ranch. 

As I write this, I am preparing a congressional field briefing in Hamilton about “Wildfire Management and Response: Challenges and Opportunities.” I look forward to keeping you posted about it. 

Let me know if you have any ideas for what we should look into, as I work to bring common sense reforms to the federal government so it works for Montana, not special interests in Washington, D.C.

Boosting our national security 

Ensuring America’s national security is one of my highest priorities. 

I recently voted for the FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that continues efforts of President Trump and congressional Republicans to rebuild our military and make our country safer and more secure. 

The legislation provides our service men and women with a well-deserved pay raise, the largest in nine years. It increases the size of our armed forces, replaces aging equipment, and makes key investments in Montana. 

It authorizes $9 million for construction of an aircraft apron at Great Falls International Airport and $15 million for National Guard Facilities in Malta.

Health care measures improve access, reduce costs 

Under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, Montanans’ premiums and other out-of-pocket expenses continue to increase, consumers’ choices have narrowed, and federal mandates have troubled rural health care facilities. 

The House recently approved measures to address some of the health care problems Americans face because of Obamacare. 

One measure repeals the Obamacare excise tax on medical devices that hindered innovation and added to the rising cost of health care. 

Others expand the use of individual health savings accounts (HSA) to cover over-the-counter medication and qualified wellness activities, such as gym memberships and youth sports. 

I supported these measures and will continue working to improve access and bring the rising cost of health care under control.

8/8/18 16:26,What We Have Accomplished Together ,"￼


August 8, 2018



Dear Lindsey:   It has been an honor to serve you in the U.S. House of Representatives. I wanted to share some of what we have accomplished so far in the 115th Congress.    Cutting Taxes for Working Families From the Cedar Valley to Dubuque, the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a win for single parents, working families, and small business owners in northeast Iowa.   My criteria for tax reform has always been based upon these three goals: simplifying tax preparation for families, lowering taxes for the middle class, and reigniting our economy. Although I am not a supporter of every provision in this bill, it achieves all three of those criteria. The Tax Cut and Jobs Act has already begun to spur economic growth since President Trump signed it into law, as seen by the highest GDP growth since 2014, at 4.1%, which resulted in increased consumer confidence, historically low minority unemployment, and higher paychecks for workers.*  Many Iowans contacted my office through negotiations for provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I am very proud to have fought for these specific provisions that were included in the final bill text.  · Preserving Federal Historic Tax Credits · Retaining the Medical Expense Deduction · Establishing Renewable Wind Energy Production Credits · Providing Section 199 Deductions for Cooperatives and their Farmers 
￼

House of Representatives is advocating for those who made sacrifices to preserve the liberties and freedoms we enjoy in the United States. As the son of a WWll veteran, I understand the importance of helping our brave men and women when they return from defending our nation.

￼

I am proud of the work we have done so far this Congress. We have taken steps to improve the overall experience for veterans at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), ensure that they have better access to healthcare and extended benefits to their spouses.

￼
 Securing Flood Wall Funding for Cedar Rapids  I am pleased to announce that my top priority - securing federal funding for the Cedar Rapids flood wall - has come to fruition. After ten years, the Army Corps of Engineers recently announced that $117 million has finally been appropriated to build the needed infrastructure in Cedar Rapids to protect from future flooding disasters. 
￼
From my first day in Congress, I have worked to build relationships in Washington to help move the Cedar Rapids flood protection project forward. After facing some headwinds my first two years, a breakthrough with the Army Corps of Engineers and the Trump Administration was achieved, when they actively partnered with myself and the Iowa delegation to bring real results for Iowa and Cedar Rapids.  I am pleased that we have secured $117 million from the federal government to complete the flood wall project. Here is what that means for the residents of Cedar Rapids. Along with local and state funds, the federal government is ensuring that downtown Cedar Rapids is protected.  · Approximately 7 miles long · Combination of permanent flood walls, removable walls, levees and gates · Includes up to 13 pump stations and detention basins to protect against rainwater flooding as pipes close  · Designed to convey the same water volume as the flood of 2008 · Removable floodwall gates at streets and railroad crossing  · Raises the 8th Avenue bridge to above the 2008 flood volume and will provide an additional emergency route across the river during future flooding events · Offers permanent protection to downtown Cedar Rapids giving local businesses confidence in being in Cedar Rapids  Protecting Cedamolr Rapids from future flooding disasters has been among my highest priorities; for this reason, I am pleased to have secured the funding to complete this project. If you have any questions regarding this process or our efforts, please feel to reach out to any of my offices in Iowa or D.C.  Passage of the 2018 Farm Bill 
Congressman Blum touring the Reckers' farm in Dyersville and discussing the 2018 Farm Bill 

￼
The U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 on June 21, 2018, and the U.S. Senate version passed on June 28, 2018. Currently, my colleagues and I are working to resolve any differences between the two bills and come out with a final product that protects farmers and their diverse needs.  After visiting many farms and speaking with countless stakeholders throughout the First District, I know the importance of providing our farming communities with certainty over the next five years by passing the 2018 Farm Bill.  This farm bill will provide vital programs to our farming communities in the First District, including maintaining a strong crop insurance program- a critical risk management program that ensures farmers can stay in business after tough years. Additionally, this bill makes needed changes to the commodity and the dairy programs to help producers struggling after a 50% decrease in farm income over the past five years.  The farm bill prioritizes conservation dollars to return the most water quality benefits without unduly competing against farmers for good rental ground, increases access to rural mental health services and encourage expansion of rural broadband infrastructure.  This legislation will reform the TANF and SNAP programs, requiring able-bodied, mentally stable, 18-59 year-old individuals to obtain a job or begin work-training to continue receiving benefits after a three-month window of unemployment. I believe TANF and SNAP programs should always be available for the disabled and the elderly, and I want to be clear- this bill does not remove benefits for those individuals.   Many Iowans depend on programs like SNAP to get them back on their feet after a difficult period in their lives. I believe in helping our neighbors when they have fallen on hard times and, as your Representative in Congress, will work to protect vital programs that assist Iowans.   Our farmers in Iowa can feed the world if we remove burdensome regulations and open markets. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in Congress and the Administration to keep improving the landscape for our farmers.   Working Hard for our Seniors  I'd like to give you an update on what my colleagues and I have done to improve the lives of seniors in northeast Iowa.   Here is a list of actions I have championed and supported during the 115th Congress:  
Congressman Blum discussing social security solvency with a northeast Iowan

￼

I hold tremendous respect for our senior community and I believe these measures will go a long way to protect them. I am committed to continuing to fight for our seniors and protecting their benefits.
Draining the Swamp  When I was sworn in, I made a commitment to preserve the integrity that Iowans demand of their public officials and to drain the swamp in Washington. Members of Congress are civil servants entrusted to be good stewards of taxpayer funds and should not benefit or have special treatment due to their position. That is why I introduced a package of legislation that is aimed at reversing the status quo of Congressional Members receiving special treatment at the taxpayer's expense.   To promote fiscal responsibility within Congress, I returned over 20% of my office's Congressional budget to the U.S. Treasury Department in the amount to $275,000. It is these kinds of actions that I believe Members of Congress should carry out to set an example of how to properly manage the funds entrusted to us, not wasting them on frivolous amenities.

Can you believe it’s already August? A lot happened in July, so I wanted to check in with you and share a few highlights.  
1. Tackling Juvenile Diabetes - In South Dakota alone, more than 40,000 people live with diabetes. I was glad to touch base with Tammy, who advocates for kids with diabetes. Read more about my work to combat juvenile diabetes here. 
￼ 
2. A Piece of Home - Vic and his family have been such dear friends over the years. They’re an incredible family who through the generations has grown Kones Korner from a small gas station to eastern South Dakota’s hunting headquarters. It was really special to be able to show them around the Capitol! 
￼ 
3. A Conversation with Students - This crew will be starting their freshman year at O’Gorman in a few weeks. Hope they are enjoying the last moments of summer! 
￼ 
4. A Few Extra Minutes - A delayed flight meant a little extra time for a meeting with fellow South Dakota travelers. We had a great talk about agri business. 
￼
5. Advocating for Agriculture - I brought Scott VanderWal, a Volga-area farmer and President of the SD Farm Bureau, to testify about the impact of China’s trade and tariff threats. Watch a piece of the hearing here.  
￼ 
6. And of course... We celebrated National Ice Cream Day in July - I think it's one of Bryon's favorite days of the year. 
￼ 
Hope you enjoyed that little snapshot of our summer so far! Hope to see you soon.

What Vanderbilt Archivists Have Learned From 50 Years Of Watching The Evening News  WPLN / Nashville Public Radio In total, it's a portrait of American life, from iconic moments to those that never make the history books. It makes up nearly 6 1/2 years' worth of video, if you were to watch them all back-to-back. 
Medicaid advocates now have two more studies to back them up  The Washington Post Advocates of Medicaid expansion got some positive reinforcement in several recently released studies. 
Leaked document: Putin lobbied Trump on arms control  POLITICO A list of issues he shared with Trump in Helsinki suggests Russia wants to continue traditional nuclear talks with the U.S. — but doesn't answer all questions about their meeting. 
The Day Trump Told Us There Was Attempted Collusion with Russia  The New Yorker On August 5, 2018, precisely forty-four years after the collapse of the Nixon Presidency, another President, Donald Trump, made his own public admission. In one of a series of early-morning tweets, Trump addressed a meeting that his son Donald, Jr., held with a Russian lawyer affiliated with the Russian government. 
No, Tariffs Aren’t Going to Pay Down the National Debt  The New York Times The budget deficit is growing much faster than any increase in tariff revenue. 
‘We Are at the Limit’: Trump’s Tariffs Turn Small Businesses Upside Down  The Wall Street Journal Large companies have mostly shrugged off the impact of the administration’s trade skirmish with China. Smaller ones and startups lack the wiggle room to absorb cost increases or shift production, and many are re-evaluating their plans and strategies. 
What It's Like On Both Sides Of The U.S.-Mexico Border's Busiest Crossing  NPR NPR recently spent time on both sides of the border, where immigration is part of everyday life. 
How Trump Radicalized ICE  The Atlantic A long-running inferiority complex, vast statutory power, a chilling new directive from the top—inside America’s unfolding immigration tragedy. 
Trump Administration Unveils Its Plan to Relax Car Pollution Rules  The New York Times WASHINGTON — The Trump administration last week put forth its long-awaited proposal to freeze antipollution and fuel-efficiency standards for cars, significantly weakening one of President Barack Obama’s signature policies to combat global warming. 
It’s official: women have been nominated for a record number of House seats  Vox Democratic women notched a bunch of victories on Tuesday, making this the biggest year for women on the ballot in history.

Friends, 
It’s hard to believe how fast this summer is flying by! I hope you’ve had some time to explore Pure Michigan and get out to our beautiful beaches and lakes.  
It’s been a very productive year, from modernizing our tax code to securing funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, and I wanted to take some time to highlight the results we've delivered on behalf of hardworking families in our district. But first I want to hear from YOU.      
In your opinion, which of the following issues should Congress prioritize NEXT?


Heath Care

Jobs and the Economy

Great Lakes and the Environment

National Security

Infrastructure

Immigration

Review Trade Agreements

Addressing Our Nation’s Most Pressing Issues
As a member of the bipartisan “Problem Solvers Caucus,” I regularly reach across the aisle to craft bipartisan solutions to some of our countries most pressing issues. I’ve worked in the House of Representatives to pass legislation to protect benefits for seniors, keep our Great Lakes clean, protect our children, combat the opioid epidemic, and help our economy grow so small businesses and families have the opportunity to secure high-paying jobs and keep more of what they earn. 
Standing up for Seniors 
Seniors and retirees have worked very hard for decades so that they can enjoy their retirement and receive the benefits they have earned. We must honor the promises we have made to those who have done so much to build our economy and who have earned a peaceful, healthy retirement.
This Congress I introduced H.R. 6084, the Improving Social Security’s Service to Victims of Identity Theft Act. This legislation passed the House on July 24th by a bipartisan voice vote and would require the Social Security Administration (SSA) to assign a single point of contact to help victims of identity theft receive the assistance they need from SSA to recover.  
I supported H.R. 3178, the Medicare Part B Improvement Act, which would strengthen Medicare by expanding access to care, improving efficiency in the delivery of care, and reducing administrative burdens on doctors and patients. I'm also a cosponsor of H.R. 1421, the Improving Access to Medicare Coverage Act which prevents Medicare beneficiaries from being saddled with insurmountable out-of-pocket costs for stays at skilled nursing facilities.  
Rest assured, I'm committed to protecting these important programs for generations to come. I am also committed to strengthening these programs by finding efficiencies, and eliminating waste, fraud and abuse.
Defending and Preserving our Great Lakes 
As a lifelong Michigan resident, I believe each of us has a responsibility to ensure our lakes are preserved for future generations. That's why this session of Congress I introduced H.R. 4787, the Great Lakes Oil Spill Prevention Act to ensure Michiganders have timely, accurate and transparent information about pipeline safety risks and to hold pipeline operators accountable. Specifically, this legislation increases reporting requirements while establishing a clear timeline that operators must follow for pipeline maintenance – and levies financial penalties for delayed action. Further, the bill increases the financial liability of pipeline operators in the case of a disaster. 
Protecting Kids with FBI Background Checks 
We can all agree on the importance of providing a safe environment for our children – but unfortunately, thousands of organizations serving children and other vulnerable populations are often unable to access the gold standard for criminal background checks, the FBI’s fingerprint-based background checks. That's why I reached across the aisle and drafted bipartisan legislation, the Child Protection Improvements Act. I'm proud this legislation was signed into law so our youth-serving organizations across America will have the resources they need to hire the best possible employees and volunteers to work with our children.   
Safer Schools: STOP School Violence Act 
Schools should be a safe place for our students to learn and thrive. As a father of three children currently attending public schools, when it comes to the safety of our children and enacting sensible security measures, political affiliation is irrelevant. That's why I voted in favor of the bipartisan STOP School Violence Act. This legislation was signed into law, and aims to improve the safety of our schools by providing resources to identify threats and enhance technology to help prevent these tragedies from occurring in the future. 
The STOP School Violence Act (H.R. 4909) will provide funding for: 
	•	Student violence prevention training to counter student violence against others and self, including training for local law enforcement officers, school personnel, and students. This prevention training would be designed to give students and school personnel the ability to recognize and respond quickly to warning signs of school violence, and would include active shooter training.
	•	Technology to improve school security including the development and operation of anonymous reporting systems such as mobile apps, a hotline, and a website. This funding may also be used for metal detectors, locks, lighting, and other technologies to keep schools safe.
	•	School threat assessment and crisis intervention teams so that school personnel can respond to threats before they materialize.
	•	More coordination with law enforcement, in particular, with those officers who already staff schools.
The STOP School Violence Act is endorsed by the Sandy Hook Promise, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Parent Teachers Association, the National Association of Social Workers, and nearly 30 other health and education organizations. 
Fighting Drug Trafficking in the Mail 
Countless lives have been cut short in Michigan as a result of the devastating opioid epidemic. In 2016 alone, opioids claimed the lives of more than 2,000 Michiganders. I was astounded to learn that current law treats packages coming in through private carriers like FedEx and UPS differently than it does shipments through the United States Postal Service (USPS), and as a result, drug traffickers can readily ship synthetic opioids into our country through the USPS. Making matters worse, these synthetic opioids can be 50 to 500 times more potent than the typical street dose of heroin. 
Now that we know how these poisons are entering our communities, we have a moral obligation to close this loophole. That's why I introduced the Synthetic Trafficking and Overdose Prevention (STOP) Act to hold the USPS to the same standards as private mail carriers. I'm pleased the House passed the STOP Act, and I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to get this important legislation signed into law.  
Economic Growth 
As a member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, we delivered once in a generation tax reform and relief to hard working families across Michigan’s Eighth District. This monumental legislation simplified the tax code, doubled the Standard Deduction for millions of Americans, and also doubled the child tax credit to $2,000 per child. Already we are seeing the benefits of tax reform as families are taking home bigger paychecks, and new American jobs are being created every day. In every corner of the country, paychecks are on the rise, and families are able to keep more of their income to spend on what they want, not what Washington D.C. wants.
According to the Tax Foundation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will create 215,000 full-time equivalent jobs in 2018, with more than 6,000 of those jobs being created here in Michigan. This summer, the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index reached 18-year high levels, and the U.S. Department of Labor announced U.S. unemployment rates are at their lowest levels since 2000. Even more positive news came with the second quarter announcement from the Commerce Department of a 4.1 percent economic growth rate. Our economy is booming!    
Constituent Services: Let Us Help! 
So far this year, my team has helped to resolve hundreds of cases on behalf of individuals in our district. If you have a problem with the federal government and need assistance, please call my office: (810) 227-8600.
Some of the issues we handle include: 
	•	Veterans benefits and medals
	•	IRS tax problems
	•	Immigration issues and visas
	•	Federal employment benefits
	•	Workers’ compensation 
	•	Problems with health care, Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid plans 
For the next few weeks, I’ll be here in Michigan meeting with constituents in all corners of the district throughout Oakland, Livingston and Ingham Counties. I also want to hear directly from YOU – whether it’s about health care, tax reform, things you’re seeing in the news, you name it. You can send your thoughts and concerns to me through my website, www.mikebishop.house.gov. 
Be sure to follow me on social media to stay up to date on the latest news, as well (links on the right-hand side of this email). In the meantime, enjoy the last few weeks of summer, and my continuing best regards to you and your family.

8/8/18 12:43,Canalside @ 10: Here’s What’s Happening Next,"￼ 
￼  ￼  ￼  ￼  ￼  ￼  
Dear Friend,
This summer, we celebrate 10 years since the opening of Canalside, which represented a new era for Buffalonians and Western New Yorkers yearning for public access to their waterfront. Since the New York Power Authority Settlement in 2005 which made possible all of the developments since, Canalside has become a year-round attraction, with 1.5 million visitors in 2016 alone. This milestone allows us to look at how far we’ve come, and what lies ahead:

NYPA SETTLEMENT
The foundations of Canalside came together in 2006, when we fought for and won a $279 million federal relicensing settlement with the New York Power Authority to redevelop Buffalo’s waterfront over the next 50 years. A Buffalo News column detailing the settlement can be read here. 
￼
The Wedding of the Waters ceremony 
CANALSIDE OPENS IN 2008

10 years ago on July 2nd, 2008, elected leaders and local officials gathered at Buffalo’s waterfront to participate in a symbolic “Wedding of the Waters” ceremony, similar to the celebration held upon the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825. At Canalside’s opening that day, the unveiling included the Central Wharf, the Whipple Truss foot bridge connecting the Central Wharf to Commercial Street, and the waterfall by the Commercial Slip. Since then, our region has seen the development of Harborcenter, the Queen City Bike Ferry, summer concerts, hockey tournaments, and so much more. Other waterfront developments along the Outer Harbor and Buffalo River have followed Canalside’s success, and private businesses have contributed to the revitalization of the waterfront area, turning it into a year-round destination. In the next 10 years there will be even more exciting projects to come.

WHAT’S NEXT?

Earlier this year, we called for six specific projects funded by the NYPA settlement, which continues for the next 10 years. Those projects will help us continue the progress Canalside has gathered for downtown Buffalo, and bring more private investment to the area. Some of the proposed upcoming projects include: 

- A mixed-use development on the north Aud block
- Improvements to Michigan Pier on the outer harbor
- A 1.5 mile nature trail along the old DL&W railroad tracks 
- Investments in additional exhibit and event space at the Naval and Military park
- A bicycle/pedestrian bridge from Silo City to the Outer Harbor
- Improvements, including a boardwalk, for the Erie Basin Marina

This year, as we celebrate 10 successful years at Canalside, we look forward to the next 10 years of transformative projects and developments. The momentum this project has created and the improvements our city and region have seen have excited people across Western New York, and it’s important that momentum be sustained.

8/8/18 12:18,Good news for NM water,"￼
August 8, 2018
Dear Friend,
I'm pleased to report that the Office of the State Engineer once again rejected a speculative water proposal to pump billions of gallons from the aquifer below the Plains of San Agustin in western New Mexico. 
I remember the first time I drove west of Magdalena and laid eyes on this vast expanse of grasslands. A couple winters ago, I took my son Carter on an elk hunt in the Continental Divide Wilderness Study Area where the views stretch out for miles above the surrounding plains. This area of our state is a paradise.
Italian billionaire Bruno Modena's proposal to pump 17 billion gallons of groundwater from the aquifer annually and construct a pipeline to transport the water far away from Catron County threatened this incredible landscape and locals' traditional way of life. Earlier this year, I wrote an op-ed in the Socorro El Defensor Chieftain and Catron Courier about what this water grab would mean for local residents and all of us who love the public lands and wildlife supported by the pristine aquifer under the Plains.
I also wrote to Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke to ask why President Trump's transition team included the Augustin Plains Ranch water speculation proposal on a list of 50 major infrastructure priorities. Both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations filed formal protests against this proposal because of potential damaging impacts on water and wildlife resources. Given the potentially devastating impacts of this water speculation project to rural communities in New Mexico, I strongly urged Secretary Zinke to renew the department's longstanding objections.
I'm proud of all the New Mexicans who made their voices heard in calling for the State Engineer's Office to reject Mr. Modena's third application in less than 10 years. Special recognition is due to local rancher Carol Pittman who has spent years keeping residents of Catron and Socorro counties informed about this threat through the San Augustin Water Report.  
The fight is not over yet. There is still an appeal process and the proponents of this project have deep pockets. But please know that I will continue to stand with you in fighting for responsible, cost effective, science-based solutions to managing New Mexico's water. 
Sincerely,
￼

Talofa Lindsey,

Some good news for American Samoa is working its way through Congress. A Senate funding bill for the Interior Department contains a $718,000 increase for American Samoa, building on last year’s $250,000 increase for about a $1 million boost over the past two yearly budgets.  The bill, led by Chairman Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, was approved last week by the Senate, and even includes a requirement for an official report to Congress on the needs of the LBJ Tropical Medical Center. The American Samoa provisions are a result of my conversations with Chairman Murkowski earlier this year about Storm Gita and the needs of LBJ hospital. The bill must be reconciled with a different version that passed the House, likely sometime this Fall. Read more here. 
﻿
Another bill (H.R. 5875) passed unanimously by the House in late July, which I cosponsored, would mean more funds for American Samoa. The bipartisan effort must still be considered by the Senate, but it amends both the Pittman-Robertson Act and the Dingell-Johnson Act that support conservation practices to make their federal funding formula for Territories much more equitable with the states, ensuring an increase for American Samoa.


Soifua,

￼

‌

 

Highlights
￼

FEMA Cost-Share: Joint efforts between myself, Governor Lolo, and others resulted in President Trump’s Administration further reviewing American Samoa’s needs related to the impact from Cyclone Gita. On June 29, the President amended the FEMA disaster declaration for American Samoa by increasing the Federal cost-share from a 75-25 split to a 90-10 split, reducing the ASG cost share by hundreds of thousands of dollars, and potentially more. Read more here. 
￼

Veterans
￼
￼

From left, Rep. Mike Coffman, Rep. Amata, Rep. Dr. Neal Dunn and Chairman Dr. Phil Roe, speaking on VA reform efforts.

Veterans’ Activity: The House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has led legislative efforts resulting in 26 bills signed into law so far by President Trump, with another 35 through the House and awaiting action by the Senate. The Committee is working from a set of over 400 proposals. The focus is on reforming the VA, streamlining the pace at which veterans’ claims are handled, improving care and access to medical help, modernizing record-keeping, and doing a full-scale analysis of VA assets to ensure efficiencies and better management practices. Read more here. 
￼
￼
￼


VA Mission Act: The most notable VA Reform legislation signed into law so far is the bipartisan Mission Act to upgrade numerous aspects of the VA with implementation already started. Congresswoman Amata cosponsored this major legislation, which originated in the Veterans’ Affairs Committee on which she serves. Read more here.  
￼

￼
￼
￼

House Speech: Congresswoman Amata spoke on the House floor in support of the bipartisan Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, H.R. 299. The House passed the legislation later that evening, and as the Congresswoman notes in her remarks, while the bill helps specific veterans it also makes a strong statement about the nation’s commitment to all veterans. Read more here. 
￼

Congratulations
￼

PACOM Change of Command: It was an absolute honor to attend the Change of Command Ceremony for the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command where Admiral Phillip S. Davidson relieved Admiral Harry Harris of the immense responsibility in overseeing the vast Pacific region. Admiral Harris, the first Asian American to attain the rank of Admiral is now serving as Ambassador to South Korea. Read more here. 
￼
￼


Close-Up: Each year American Samoa’s students in the Department of Interior’s Close-Up program visit our nation’s capital. My staff in the Washington office was delighted to welcome another group of enthusiastic students. This program is an opportunity for students to see firsthand the inner workings of our government. Read more here.

Progress
￼

New Telecommunications Cable: In other news, this month the American Samoa Government welcomed the new fiber optic undersea cable which has potential for the future of Veterans’ Telehealth services. I know many on the islands are interested in this project with expectations for much better internet service, and I look forward to hearing good reports of improvements for our people and small businesses. I also look to it as a building block in the future of Telehealth and veterans’ medical care options that could become available. 
￼

Coral Reef Protection: Congresswoman Aumua Amata welcomed reintroduction of the Coral Reef Conservation Reauthorization Act (H.R. 5996) to boost federal funding and key preservation measures for coral reefs. Congresswoman Amata is an original cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation, which has unanimous support from the insular representatives of all the island Territories. Read more here. 
￼

Federal Grants: Grants to the departments of American Samoa Government are an important part of keeping services available. Congress appropriates funds for federal agencies that include grants and grant programs, sometimes specifically, and sometimes giving the department discretion. At the Territorial level, ASG employees put in the work to apply for many of these grant opportunities. Recent federal grants to American Samoa include the following: In July, $50,000 for food safety to the American Samoa Department of Agriculture from the Food and Drug Administration; in June, $300,000 in beach quality monitoring assistance available from the Environmental Protection Agency; also in June, $2,825,506 in health funding through a Pacific Basin grant from Health and Human Services; and in April, $10.6 million in federal dollars through the Interior Department for various infrastructure efforts. Most recently, American Samoa is welcoming $3.9 million in federal funds for children’s education and the Head Start program, along with $1 million for the Fitiuta Airport to study long term runway preservation and keep this airport in service for the future. 
￼

Air Service: The Congresswoman’s measure to promote reliable air service in American Samoa awaits action in the Senate. The Congresswoman’s legislation passed the House in late April, and since it’s included in major FAA Authorization legislation, the Senate and House will ultimately reconcile their bills, meaning the measure has reached the last legislative step.

Supporting Our Military and Protecting Michigan's Assets
As your representative in Congress, I want to share news about a bill that recently passed the House and Senate, and is on its way to President Trump for signature.
For the 58th straight year, members of the House and Senate were able to reach a bipartisan consensus and pass a bill that supports our military and our nation. This year’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which is in line with Trump Administration requests, includes significant funding to ensure readiness, maintain equipment, and restore our nation’s military capabilities. It also provides a 2.6% pay raise for our troops, the largest in 9 years. 
The bill protects the United States from malicious technology from Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE by banning those companies from working with the U.S. government and U.S. government related entities. It maintains sanctions against - and invests in military capabilities to confront - threats from Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and more.
For Michiganders back home, the NDAA includes funds for wing replacement and modernization of A-10s housed at Selfridge ANGB, authorizes upgrades for Stryker A1 combat vehicles and Abrams tanks, and includes my language affirming the national security importance of the Soo Locks. 
As you may know, nearly all domestic iron ore – which is required for certain steel production, a substantial part of our economy and essential for national defense – travels through the Soo Locks. There is no redundancy or alternatives to the locks. That’s why I am glad this NDAA urges the US Army Corps of Engineers, and all involved executive branch agencies, to expedite any necessary reviews, analysis, and approvals in order to speed the required upgrades at the Soo Locks. I will continue to do everything and anything I can in Congress to get this project built, both as a member of the House Armed Services Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, conversations with my colleagues and the Administration, or on bills like this.
Finally, the bill included my amendment that focuses on eliminating burdensome and ineffective procurement rules that add no value and result in no cost savings to the government or contractors. 
Signing of this NDAA into law ensures our military has the resources and training to secure our nation.

PROUD TO SERVE MISSISSIPPI’S THIRD DISTRICT 
Dear Friend,

The Order of the Purple Heart is the oldest military decoration awarded for military merit. This prestigious award is dedicated to members of US Armed Forces who have been killed or wounded while serving. 

To honor the legacy of those who have served, House Republicans have signed common sense legislation to reinvest in our military and strengthen our armed forces. This is a new era for our nation's military. 

The Trump Administration has prioritized the military, and we are working together to strengthen and rebuild – something that has been neglected for far too long. Our strong support for this country’s military is widespread. 
The effects of these efforts are felt not only in the strengthening of our national security, but also in the paychecks of soldiers and manufacturers across the 3rd District and the state of Mississippi. 
On July 26, the United States House of Representatives passed the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. Also known as the NDAA, this bill has authorized $717 billion dollars to rebuild and re-strengthen our US military. Additionally, the NDAA authorized increases in size of the US Army, Navy, Air Force, Naval and Air Reserve, and Air Guard.   A key part of this bill addresses our military’s most valuable asset, its service members; that’s why we have fully funded a 2.6% pay raise for all service men and women, the largest increase in nine years. This funding also extends special pay and bonuses to high demand fields. Furthermore, this authorizing bill extends multiple ship and plane building contracts that impact multiple manufacturers across the district and the state. 
Evidence of this growth in Mississippi military manufacturing was announced in May, when Raytheon announced a $100 million expansion of its Forest radar manufacturing facility. Although it looks to hire about 50 additional permanent jobs, the design, construction, and maintenance of the facility will impact the district in a much larger way. 
Over the next 4 months, I will continue to work diligently to provide for our active military Servicemembers, our veterans, and their families. 

God Bless,

￼

AGRICULTURE Update - June/July 2018
￼
Meeting with members of the Montana Farm Bureau Federation
TOP STORY  With Montana’s farmers and ranchers facing low commodity prices, the daily challenges of weather, and uncertainty related to trade, it is essential that Congress works to provide certainty where it can. That is why I was pleased to see the Senate pass the Farm Bill in late June with my strong support by a bipartisan vote of 86-11. And just last week, the Senate formally voted to go to conference to reconcile its bill with what has passed the House of Representatives.  This Farm Bill is good news for Montana farmers and ranchers and will help provide certainty for Montana agriculture in these difficult times. I am looking forward to upcoming conference negotiations with the House to get an effective and efficient Farm Bill to the desk of the President as quickly as possible.
FARM BILL HIGHLIGHTS  Here are a few Montana priorities that I helped secure in the Farm Bill:  • Protected critical safety net programs such as crop insurance and the sugar program • Provided ag research funding for land grant universities, such as Montana State University and ag research stations across Montana • Prioritized rural broadband for Montana’s unserved communities • Created an important vaccine bank to help better respond to animal disease outbreaks • Strengthened conservation programs that are important to Montana farmers, ranchers, and sportsmen • Implemented important provisions supporting active forest management  
￼
Meeting with Montana Agri-Women in July
MEETING MONTANA’S AG LEADERS  One of the greatest privileges I have as a United States senator is meeting with Montanans in our nation's capital. Over the past couple months, I’ve had the opportunity to discuss agricultural priorities with the Montana Farm Bureau Federation, Montana Agri-women, sugar beet producers, FFA and 4-H students and others. If you have the opportunity to visit D.C., please let me know by contacting my office to schedule a meeting or join me at Montana Coffee. 
WHAT'S AHEAD   With Farm Bill negotiations between the Senate and the House underway, I will work to protect Montana’s priorities and get a Farm Bill to President Trump’s desk as quickly as possible.
In addition, I am urging the Administration to finalize ongoing trade negotiations and pursue new agreements to help our farmers, ranchers and businesses be able to access new markets. Better trade deals are needed to end the growing uncertainty concerning our access to markets overseas. In the meantime, President Trump and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue are  developing an aid package for U.S. farmers and ranchers impacted by retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries. This is helpful but only a short-term solution.

BEATTY BULLETIN SUMMER 2018

Beatty Rule Gaining Legislative Momentum 
The Ensuring Diverse Leadership Act, H.R. 485, also known as the “Beatty Rule,” was recently introduced in the U.S. Senate by Senator Kamala D. Harris (CA). 
The Senate bill, the Diverse Leadership Act, S. 2829, like H.R. 485, would ensure that at least one minority and one female candidate are interviewed for each presidential vacancy at any of the twelve reserve banks in the Federal Reserve System. Senators Dianne Feinstein (CA), Cory Booker (NJ), and Kirsten Gillibrand (NY) are lead cosponsors. 
“It is hard to believe that up until last year, in the Federal Reserve’s 105-year history, no African-American had ever served as a regional bank president and only six women ever held the position. To build a stronger economy, we need the talents, skills, and expertise that diversity offers. I am proud to lead the charge in the House on this important bill and am honored to have Senator Kamala Harris spearhead the companion piece of legislation in the Senate.” 
￼  Congresswoman Beatty prepares for a Financial Services Committee hearing, reviewing questions on the need for more diverse leadership in the economy and the federal government. (June 27, 2018)
Both bills are influenced by the National Football League’s ‘Rooney Rule,’ which was established in 2003 to boost diversity among the League’s head coaching positions. 

 
May 22nd Telephone Town Hall Addresses Local and National Issues 
On May 22, 2018, Congresswoman Beatty held a telephone town hall—streamed live on her Facebook page and Congressional website—with nearly 5,000 Central Ohioans. Open to all constituents of Ohio’s Third Congressional District, the telephone town hall was an opportunity for constituents to share their thoughts and opinions on a whole host of issues. Topics included health care, education, the economy, jobs, trade, gun violence, criminal justice reform, campaign finance reform, the opioid crisis, and much more.
Since coming to Congress, Beatty has made it a priority to continually connect with Central Ohioans by holding community-based and in-person events, as well as hosting numerous telephone town halls when she is working in Washington, D.C. 
￼ 
Congresswoman Beatty conducts her May 22nd telephone town hall, talking with constituents via phone and social media about the critical issues facing Central Ohio and the nation, as students from The Ohio State University sit in the audience.
Also participating in the telephone town hall were 25 students from The Ohio State University’s John Glenn College of Public Affairs’ Washington Academic Internship Program (WAIP). They were in the audience to learn and see firsthand the inner-workings of Congress and the federal government.  

 
 
The 2018 Congressional Art Competition
This year, Congresswoman Beatty served as co-chair of the 2018 National Congressional Art Competition, welcoming more than 400 students, their parents, and teachers to the United States Capitol. Now in its 37th year, the Congressional Art Competition provides high school students from across the country the opportunity to showcase their artistic talents. A record 428 congressional offices participated in 2018, representing Ohio’s Third Congressional District was Ms. Rebecca Maston of Northland High School. 
￼ 
Congresswoman Beatty recognizes the art competition winners from Ohio’s Third Congressional District during a May 2nd community event, including (left to right) Yahfa Guerra (3rd place), Danasha Edgington (2nd place), and Rebecca Maston (1st place); as well as People’s Choice Award (social media) winners Diana Bovshovets (1stplace), Stephanie Mesa (2nd place), and Taylor McGuire (3rd place). (June 27, 2018)
“I am proud to have this year’s winning piece from Central Ohio hang in the U.S. Capitol. Congratulations to all of this year’s winners. I also want to thank the teachers, parents, judges, and other community entities that made the 2018 Congressional Art Competition an unbelievable success.”
 
Fighting to Protect Critical Central Ohio Jobs
The U.S. House of Representatives passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019, H.R. 5515, on July 26, 2018. After the vote, Congresswoman Beatty issued the following statement:
“I voted for the final conference report on the NDAA because of its importance in protecting our national security and supporting our men and women in uniform. The final version of the NDAA represents a significant improvement for Central Ohio when compared to the bill that the House considered earlier this year. Rather than make cuts to Department of Defense (DoD) agencies that employ roughly 6,000 workers at the Defense Supply Center Columbus (DSCC), the conference report protects many of those jobs and gives DoD more flexibility to address its budgetary needs.
Moving forward, as DoD conducts its review of the agencies covered in this NDAA bill, I will continue to work with stakeholders and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure that the workers at DSCC can continue to contribute to our national defense and to our communities here in Central Ohio.”  

 
Beatty Bill Establishing National Veterans Memorial and Museum Now Law   Congresswoman Beatty is the lead Democratic cosponsor of legislation signed into law on June 23, 2018, designating the new memorial and museum being built in downtown Columbus as the ‘National Veterans Memorial and Museum.’ 
“Columbus is the perfect place for this historic and awe-inspiring museum that will serve as a permanent landmark to so many brave Americans and as a memorial to all those who paid the ultimate sacrifice. I want to thank the entire Ohio Congressional Delegation for working together in a bipartisan fashion on this bill, and cannot wait to see, hear, and experience everything the museum has to offer.”
The museum, located at 300 West Broad Street in Columbus, will serve as a civic landmark to honor, connect, inspire, and educate all Americans about the service and sacrifice of our nation’s veterans. It will be the only public museum of its kind that exists for the exclusive role of sharing the experiences of veterans across all eras, conflicts, and branches of the military.
 
In the Community: AmeriCorps VISTA Summer Associates 
￼   On June 5, 2018, Congresswoman Beatty welcomes the 10thgroup of AmeriCorps VISTA Summer Associates working on fighting childhood hunger, administering the Oath of Service to 70 national service members as they kick off their summer of service.


 
Delivering Results: $24 Million+ in Federal Funding and Grants for Central Ohio
Since April 2018, Congresswoman Beatty has helped secure more than $24 million in federal funds and grants for numerous district priorities, programs, and initiatives. Highlights include $7.4 million for Rickenbacker Airport to complete the third phase of a three-part taxiway rehabilitation project; more than $6 million for the City of Columbus’ Community Shelter Board to tackle youth homelessness; nearly $1 million in National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) funding for the Ohio Arts Council; and over $232,000 for Battelle Memorial Institute from the National Science Foundation.
“I believe it is important to ensure vital Central Ohio industries, agencies, and programs receive the necessary support to continue to improve and build upon their work so that they can better serve my constituents and their needs.”

8/8/18 1:15,ICYMI: Trade Assistance for Farmers,"￼ 
  

Fighting for Delaware's Farmers
Dear Friend, 

Agriculture has a significant role in Delaware, where 90% of our farmers are family owned and one in four acres are permanently preserved for farmland. We’ve seen firsthand the impact of retaliatory tariffs, and our farmers want the tools to stay competitive while they find new markets to sell their crops and commodities. That's why I'm focused on a permanent fix to help impacted farmers, growers, and businesses get the assistance they need in current and future agricultural markets.

￼

Please read the op-ed I wrote for Delaware State news outlining the actions I'm taking to protect Delaware's farmers from trade policies. 

Best,

Lisa Blunt Rochester
Member of Congress

Dear Friend,  Medicare has helped ensure millions of Arizona seniors can enjoy a healthy and secure retirement. By the time they retire, Arizonans have worked hard to earn their Social Security and Medicare benefits. It’s our responsibility to make sure seniors can count on these benefits now and into the future  Recently, we marked the 53rd anniversary of Medicare becoming law. I joined the Arizona Alliance for Retired Americans and residents at Phoenix’s  Beatitudes senior living community to celebrate the anniversary.  Residents shared with me how they count on Medicare and Social Security, and we discussed the critical need to protect these important programs. That's why I voted to protect these hard-earned benefits so Arizonans can retire with security and dignity. 
￼
 I’ll keep fighting to make health care affordable for all Arizonans and protect the Social Security and Medicare benefits Arizonans have earned. Seniors should have peace of mind, knowing they can count on these important programs.  I am honored to serve in Congress on behalf of Arizona families like yours. We always appreciate hearing from you on current topics and issues that are important to you. If there is an issue that concerns you, please let us know by clicking this link or by calling our Phoenix office: 602-956-2285.

Working to secure the southern border

Dear Lindsey,
I wanted to reach out to let you know of my recent tour of the U.S.-Mexico border in California. I offer my sincere appreciation to the extremely dedicated women and men at U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in San Diego and the Department of Homeland Security for their excellent guidance and information during my visit.  
Witnessing firsthand the constant challenges of securing America’s southern border brings on a whole new appreciation for what our law enforcement agents are faced with on a daily basis. CBP agents are the front line in making certain our immigration laws actually mean something. Along with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), they are bravely battling human trafficking, drug smuggling and threats to the homeland—keeping all of us safe. More than ever, they deserve our respect and gratitude for a very tough job. 
The good news is the San Diego sector is leading the way in fighting illegal entry—and processing legal entry—across our southern border.
As agent Tekae Michael told me, “San Diego is a great example of how combining infrastructure and increased manpower can enhance the security. It’s been a great success story.”  
￼
Rep. Lewis with agent Tekae Michael.

It’s hard to imagine, but just a couple of decades ago there was literally no infrastructure in the San Diego sector and border patrol agents were overrun with illegal aliens and smuggling. In fact, at ‘smuggler’s gulch’ and elsewhere along the Mexican border 628,000 illegal aliens were apprehended in just one year. 
Eventually, a simple corrugated small steel wall was erected and, later, a secondary chain was put up in selected high traffic areas in the late ‘90s. Numerous man-made tunnels just beneath the surface, and visible holes repeatedly patched are evidence of what still needed to be done. 
￼
Original San Diego border wall.


￼
Updated San Diego border wall.

As you can see, much of the San Diego sector’s recent success has been due to increased personnel and a new primary wall which is embedded approximately four feet below the surface to help eliminate the shallow tunnels being dug. And even though it took upwards of ten years of litigation over the alleged environmental impact of infill, roadways for patrols and infrastructure, ‘smuggler’s gulch’ is no more. 
Now, thanks to border security, the California border town of San Yisdro is safer and thriving with a large new mall and neighborhood right next to the border.
It is not illegal in Mexico to jump the border so it is up to these brave men and women, working ten hour shifts, five days week, to patrol the rugged mountain terrain on foot—in one-person units and often in the face of danger (where large rocks are used as weapons) and adversity. There are also sections of the wall that have been torn and are in need of repair, or end altogether, providing additional patrol challenges. 
￼
Rep. Lewis at end of San Diego border wall.

  
￼
Agent Michael showing a repaired section in the San Diego border wall.

At San Yisdro, over 100,000 entrants and refugees per day travel through America’s largest legal port of entry. There, CBP works diligently to capture the hard narcotics (70% of fentanyl is captured here) and to save the victims of human trafficking being smuggled across the border. The latest technology—and some older canine versions—are vital assets in protecting the victims of these attempts. 
Because smugglers can earn up to $70,000 per human victim and $18,000-$22,000 per kilo of methamphetamine, the financial incentives provided by an array of conspirators on both ends of the journey abound. All too often, it’s people and drugs coming in and cash going out. 
These law enforcement agents need our help and support to complete their successful mission in California and along our southern border. Funding for a new more comprehensive and larger wall that is embedded deeper into the ground and is more secure at the top must be provided. As you can see, the prototypes for the latest ‘wall’ technology are on display and being tested for the remaining and substantial gaps in the 2,000 mile southern border. 
￼
Border wall prototype.

San Diego is leading the way, and it’s vital that Congress works to continue securing our country’s border.
To that end, I have voted multiple times these past few months to secure our border and enact genuine immigration reform including supporting H.R. 6136, the Border Security and Immigration Reform Act. This bill, which included meaningful reforms that protect our national security while ensuring we have a fair system for individuals to immigrate to the United States, increases border security, closes enforcement loopholes, and reforms the legal immigration system.
I will continue to promote the safety and security of our country and its citizens. As I work on this and other issues, I always like to hear directly from you.  Please share any thoughts you may have through my website, and sign up for my e-mail newsletter for the latest updates from Washington, D.C. and around the district.

Forces on the Ground
Dear Friends,
Last year, a devastating tornado hit the southwest part of Georgia, causing significant damage to portions of the Marine Corps Logistics Base (MCLB) in Albany. Through my assignment on the House Armed Services Committee, last week, I toured the installation’s Logistics Command, the Marine Depot Maintenance Command, and the Marine Force Storage Center, while also getting a firsthand look at the recovery efforts.
While there, I was pleased to talk with officers and military leaders about the creative ways they are maintaining and modernizing our equipment and improving the supply chain management, contracting support, and the industrial infrastructure.

Summer Surge
Two years ago, House Republicans said there was a better way forward for our country. Since then, we have enacted a bold agenda that has improved the lives of Americans nationwide. Through the reforms implemented in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and because of fiscal policies that make it easier to do business in America, July marked yet another month of positive U.S. economic news.  · Small Businesses Hiring or Trying To Hire Hits 19 Year High (NFIB) ·  U.S. Workers See Biggest Pay, Benefit Increase in 10 Years (Fox Business) ·  Jobless Claims in U.S. Decline to Lowest Level Since 1969 (Bloomberg) ·  Second Quarter GDP Jumps 4.1% for Best Pace in Nearly Four Years (CNBC)
Republicans in Congress have worked tirelessly to enact laws that reduce the size and scope of government, allow you to keep more of your hard-earned money, and encourage small businesses to hire more workers. The American people are seeing the results of these pro-growth policies. Not only is unemployment down and economic optimism up, but workers have also received their biggest pay bump in almost a decade! 

In the Community
It is an honor to be able to nominate outstanding young men and women to our Nation’s military service academies. These esteemed institutions provide a world-class education and instill leadership skills that will prepare their graduates for success in both military and civilian life. If a student wishes to pursue this distinguished education and vocation, it is important that they start the process early in their middle and high school careers.
On Saturday, August 18th from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., I’m hosting my annual Academy Day event to provide students, parents, and counselors the opportunity to meet with liaisons from each of America’s respective service academies to gain essential information as they consider serving our country through military service.
My office is prepared to help guide folks through each step, and I look forward to helping those individuals interested in attending a service academy realize their potential and achieve their goals.
￼
Since being elected, I’ve humbly participated in several ceremonies honoring 10th District veterans in an effort to show appreciation for all that they and their families have sacrificed. On Tuesday, August 28th at 6:00 p.m., I’m joining the Georgia Department of Veterans Service Commissioner Mike Roby, Johnson County Probate Court Judge Mary Jo Buxton, and the Wrightsville Rotary Club in recognizing local Vietnam veterans for their military service during a certificate and lapel pin presentation ceremony at the Johnson County Courthouse, located at 2557 E. Elm Street E, Wrightsville, GA 31096.
Vietnam veterans who are interested in participating in the ceremony may contact the GDVS Central Office via email at bzeringue@vs.state.ga.us with their DD Form 214 attached or fax their information (name, address, and phone number) and “214” to (404) 656-7006, with their information marked “Johnson County C&P Ceremony.”  The deadline to sign up is Tuesday, August 21, 2018.

Remembering Bill Acker
Last week, we were all deeply saddened by the passing of former GMC President Major General William “Bill” Acker. After more than 33 distinguished years serving our country as a combat pilot before returning to his alma mater in Milledgeville, General Acker was a well-known force in the community. In his many years as President of GMC, General Acker worked toward moving the institution to new heights and oversaw tremendous growth with the addition of the sixth and seventh grades to the Prep School and four new college campuses around the State of Georgia.
Dee Dee and I extend our heartfelt condolences and prayers to his wife, Nadine, his three children, Patricia, Kathryn, and William Jr., as well as many grandchildren and several great-grandchildren, during this incredibly difficult time. Learn more about the life and legacy of Major General Bill Acker here.

Staying Connected
As many of you know, because of mass communications restrictions instituted by the Committee on House Administration’s Members of Congress Handbook, I am unable to host regular events like Telephone Town Halls in the 90-day period leading up to an election. It’s important to me that I stay in communication with you and the community about the work I’m doing on behalf of the 10th District. The best way that I am able to keep you informed is through my e-newsletter, and I encourage you to pass this email along to your friends and neighbors.
As always, I’m here to serve you. Please contact my office with any questions, comments, or concerns. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to keep track of upcoming legislation and events!

Dear Friend, 
This week, I had the opportunity to meet with people and organizations doing amazing work across Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District. I’m proud of the hard work they are doing in our community and fortunate to be able to share their stories.
SUPPORTING ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTH CARE FOR OUR VETS 
I visited the VA Southeast Primary Care Clinic in Henderson, a facility dedicated to providing medical services to veterans. With roughly 56,000 veterans calling our district home, ensuring that our veterans and their families receive the care, resources, and respect they deserve is one of my highest priorities. Read more about my visit to VA Southeast Primary Care Clinic here. 
￼ 
Rep. Jacky Rosen (NV-03) tours the VA Southeast Primary Care Clinic in Henderson, discusses health issues affecting Nevada’s veterans. 
Nevada’s veterans put their lives on the line to protect this nation, and it is our responsibility in Congress to support them when they finish their service. That’s why I was proud to see key provisions from my Veterans Deserve Better Act, which will improve health care access for those who count on the Veterans Choice Program, get signed into law recently. I’m also proud to have helped pass legislation out of the House last month to designate a three-digit dialing code for a suicide prevention and mental health national crisis hotline for veterans nationwide. I will continue to fight for better health care and improved resources to support those who have sacrificed so much to defend our country.
DEFENDING PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND LOWERING PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS  
On Thursday, I toured The Caring Place and visited with cancer patients to hear their stories and discuss my efforts to lower prescription drug costs and safeguard people with pre-existing conditions.
The Trump Administration’s efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act's protections for pre-existing conditions and failure to rein in prescription drug prices are a threat to the lives of countless Nevadans, especially those who are battling cancer. That’s why I introduced bills last month to defend the constitutionality of the ACA’s coverage protections in a pending federal lawsuit and cap out-of-pocket prescription drug costs. I will continue to work with my colleagues to protect and expand access to affordable health care for every Nevadan.
Read more about my visit to The Caring Place here.
FIGHTING TO DEFEND WOMEN’S ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE  
This week, I also met with women’s health providers and advocates in Southern Nevada about their concerns around access to care and reproductive freedom. In Congress, I’m working to protect Planned Parenthood from political attacks, restore rules requiring employers to provide contraception coverage, and reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. I’m committed to empowering women everywhere to be able to make their own medical decisions and access the care and services they need to live healthy, productive lives.

NEWS FROM THE 2ND DISTRICT
Dear Lindsey, 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents combat terrorism, human trafficking, drug smuggling and gang activity. Last year alone, ICE arrested 4,818 transnational gang members and seized over 980,000 pounds of narcotics. ICE is critical to American security and public safety.   I was a proud co-sponsor of the House Resolution that affirms Congressional support for the men and women of ICE and for all federal, state and military personnel who are protecting our borders. Last week's vote to support our ICE agents should send a strong message that House Democrats prioritized open borders and chaos instead of American national security and community safety. Law and order is a cornerstone of our Republic, and to call for the abolishment of such a vital law enforcement agency created after 9/11 is a radical and dangerous agenda.   I spoke with Harris Faulkner about the importance of ICE and the dangers of the call to abolish the agency. Click HERE or below to watch. 
￼ 
  
A Voice for Southern Arizona on the National Stage 
￼   Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels is a strong leader with first-hand experience providing security and safety to a border community. I have been fortunate to work with Sheriff Dannels on a number of border and law enforcement initiatives. When I invited DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to Southern Arizona, we met with border sheriffs including Dannels near the Douglas Port of Entry. As a reult of that visit, Mark is the first local law enforcement officer nominated by Secretary Nielsen to serve on the DHS Advisory Council. Congratulations Sheriff Dannels for this honor that recognizes his leadership and effectiveness as a border Sheriff!  
￼ 
Sheriff Dannels was my guest of honor at the State of the Union this year. 
Reining in Burdensome Regulations  
Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation appropriating funds for the Department of the Interior (DOI) and Related Agencies.   This legislation reins in the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) overreaching regulatory agenda from the last administration, repeals the harmful Waters of the United States rule which stifles economic development and job creation, and relieves cattle ranchers from regulatory red tape.   The bill also:  
	•	Directs $500 million in funding for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program which sends funds to local governments, including those in all 15 Arizona counties, to make up for the vast amounts of federal lands that don’t generate property taxes for important local programs.
	•	Allocates $3.9 billion for the DOI and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) to fight and prevent forest fires that threaten communities across the nation and in AZ. 
	•	Combats the opioid epidemic by providing targeted funding for the Office of National Drug Control Policy and the High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program. 
	•	Provides for the Internal Revenue Service to further implement the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
I worked with the leaders of these Appropriations Committees to ensure these important programs received appropriate funding. I will continue to work to get this legislation to the President's desk. 
Meeting with Arizonans at the Capitol  
I met with Chris Clements of Boulder Crest Retreat Arizona and Justin Brown, the founder of HillVets. Boulder Crest Retreat Arizona is a non-profit that offers innovative programs to combat veterans and their families and HillVets is an organization that focuses on helping veterans find employment and then advance professionally. We talked about how Congress can better help our veterans recover and heal after they have served. I’m co-sponsoring a bill which directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to create a pilot program studying post traumatic growth programs.

Press Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
Date: August 7, 2018
Coal in Salem?
During two visits to local manufacturing facilities today, I heard encouraging news about the economy that I wanted to share with you. My stops at Blue Ridge Diesel and Carter Machinery in Salem offered a positive outlook of how businesses and jobs are faring today. People at both locations let me know that reducing regulations and the tax cuts have been good for business.
Both companies said coal production was extremely important to their businesses and the increase in coal business has been vital for them.
 
                                               ￼
 
 Blue Ridge Diesel: “If coal is booming, we are booming.”
The Blue Ridge Diesel plant in Salem services, rehabs, and sells engines most often destined for coal mines. Although not in Virginia’s coalfields, its success creates their success. As I heard on my visit, “If coal is booming, we are booming.” And as coal’s fortunes have improved, so have Blue Ridge Diesel’s. Activity at the mines increases the need for the goods and services of companies like Blue Ridge Diesel and the companies they supply, like Paul’s Fans of Big Rock, Buchanan County. With an improved economy in the coal region, people are more willing to invest in the machines that Blue Ridge Diesel sells and refurbishes.
                                             ￼
Carter Machinery: “Eighteen months ago, this lot was empty.”
Carter Machinery rents, sells, and maintains Caterpillar equipment, employing 350 people at its Salem facility. Its business is tied to a lot of industries, but coal is a mainstay. During my visit, an employee pointed to the lot pictured above and told me, “Eighteen month ago, this lot was empty.” Now, it is occupied by engines waiting to be serviced. The strong economy, particularly in the coal region, has brought additional business to Carter Machinery.
Believe it or not, even in the Roanoke Valley, where people don’t often think of themselves as a coal community, there are still thousands of jobs connected to coal.
You can find more pictures from my visits to Blue Ridge Diesel and Carter Machinery below.

From the Hill to the Mountains
PASSING THE SPENDING PACKAGE  
The Minibus includes funding to prevent Chinese Fentanyl from entering the U.S., treat substance use disorder, return an Amtrak ticket agent to West Virginia and expand broadband service in West Virginia  
Last week I secured funding for top West Virginia priorities in the Minibus that was just passed by the Senate. The spending package includes funding for the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, Financial Services and General Government, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
I authored provisions to investigate and prevent the smuggling of illicit fentanyl from China, fund FDA’s continued efforts to fight the opioid epidemic, save West Virginia’s Amtrak ticket agent, and urge the FCC to set aside funding for providing broadband service to the most difficult to serve areas in rural America. 
This bill includes huge wins for West Virginia, and I am thrilled to see it pass the Senate. I made sure that this legislation included funding and policies that protected communities from illicit Chinese fentanyl and opioid addiction, as well as better connect rural residents to needed goods and services by ensuring that our roads and highways are funded, securing an Amtrak ticket agent in the state, and expanding broadband access. Now my top priority will be making sure these West Virginia wins stay in the final spending bill that is now going to conference with the House of Representatives.

On the Road 
On Friday, I met with clergy members in Wheeling to discuss the role our faith can play in protecting healthcare coverage for West Virginians. We talked about the fact that right now West Virginia’s Attorney General is suing to allow insurance companies to once again deny coverage to West Virginians with pre-existing conditions. If he succeeds, every person in our state would be effected. Nearly 800,000 West Virginians have a pre-existing condition, including 90,600 children. This means turning our backs on West Virginians with cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, asthma or women who are pregnant. I am determined to protect these individuals and their families from the old discriminatory practices of the health insurance industry. For a lot of West Virginians with pre-existing conditions, insurance coverage is the difference between life and death, and I will do everything I can to protect them.
Over the weekend, I spoke with the WV Coal Association and the Independent Oil and Gas Association. Like all true West Virginians, I am proud of the critical role our state plays in providing energy to our nation. I remain committed to working on both sides of the aisle to develop a realistic and responsible clean energy policy for the future that balances the needs of our economy and our environment. Achieving true energy independence requires us to recognize the important role that these abundant natural resources play.
￼ 
￼ 
Senator Manchin continues to ask West Virginians to share their stories about the importance of protecting access for those with pre-existing conditions by emailing them to healthcare@manchin.senate.gov. Senator Manchin will read these stories on the Senate Floor.  
__ 
Then, early this week, I had the pleasure of speaking at the Ceredo Kenova Area Business Association meeting. It is always exciting to see our local business leaders and innovators together planning the future of our beautiful communities.

How May We Help You?
I truly appreciate the opportunity to hear from my fellow West Virginians. As your U.S. Senator, I am proud to be your voice with government agencies during your time of need. My goal is to provide top-notch customer service for every West Virginian who contacts me, or who may need help.  I have a team of caseworkers in each of my four offices to help you with matters of concern. While I have no direct jurisdiction in the administrative matters of any federal, state, or local agency, I welcome the opportunity to assist you with whatever problem you may be experiencing and ask that full consideration be given to your case. 
Recently, Kim Good in my Charleston Office was able to assist Ms. Arin Shatto with her visa to study in Bengaluru, India.  Arin applied for her visa in February using a private service so that she would be able to travel in June.  Within a week of her travel date, she had not yet received her visa and passport.  Kim was able to coordinate with the visa service as well as Embassy officials to ensure that Arin’s passport was received in time to travel.  If you need help with the State Department, the IRS, VA, Social Security, Black Lung benefits, any other agency, please contact my office or click here to email me.

Congressman Cook Co-sponsors Legislation to Revitalize National Parks
Congressman Cook is co-sponsoring the Restore Our Parks and Public Lands Act of 2018.

This bipartisan legislation establishes the National Park Service and Public Lands Restoration Fund, which would provide mandatory funding for the high-priority deferred maintenance needs that support critical infrastructure and visitor services at our national parks, wildlife refuges, and other public lands.

Federal land management agencies are facing an extraordinary deferred maintenance backlog which is jeopardizing the safety and quality of visitors’ enjoyment of our national parks, wildlife refuges, and other public lands. The Department of the Interior’s total deferred maintenance backlog alone currently stands at $16 billion.

The growing maintenance backlog on public lands could cause detrimental economic impacts. Our 417 national parks received over 331 million visitors last year. They also support a robust tourism economy, generating $18.2 billion for our public lands gateway communities in 2017 and supporting 306,000 jobs.

The Fund would draw from all sources of federal energy revenue, onshore and offshore, as well as alternative and renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, and hydropower. It may also receive private donations.

Cook’s 8th Congressional District is home to three National Parks: Joshua Tree, Death Valley, and the Mojave National Preserve. These parks have millions of dollars in deferred maintenance needs that could be addressed by this legislation.

Cook said, “This crucial bipartisan legislation is essential to ensure that our national parks have the resources they need to accommodate visitors. In my district, Joshua Tree National Park set a new attendance record last year with more than 2.8 million visitors. I want to be sure that our national parks remain safe and accessible for everyone to enjoy for years to come. This legislation will help achieve this.”

Dear Friends –
I hope you’re all enjoying your summer! It has been a hot one here in Connecticut!
I wanted to share some updates on legislation I’ve been working on down in Washington, D.C., and some of the events I’ve held up here in the First District.
Legislative Updates:
	•	The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (NDAA) has passed the House and Senate and is now headed to the President’s desk. This will continue the growth of Connecticut’s thriving defense manufacturing ecosystem while bolstering our military and national security. Work on our nation’s defense programs is supporting hundreds of suppliers and over $1.7 billion in economic activity for the Connecticut economy. As co-chair of the F-35 Caucus, I am proud to have fought to ensure this bill includes flexibility for the DoD to purchase additional fighter jets that support more than 4,600 jobs and $545 million in economic activity in the First District alone. This bill is a win for the Connecticut economy and the men and women who protect our country.
	•	In July, two bills that I led, the Improving Social Security’s Service to Victims of Identity Theft Act (H.R. 6084) and the Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC) Payment Transparency Act (H.R. 6138) passed the House of Representatives. Medicare and Social Security are our country’s greatest insurance programs that millions of Americans, especially seniors, rely on nationwide. These are two bipartisan solutions that will help strengthen both programs and I am pleased they have been unanimously approved by the House of Representatives. These are the eighth and ninth bills that I’ve led that have passed the House this Congress.
	•	I also worked with Rep. Joe Courtney and our Connecticut Senators on two amendments to help address the crumbling foundations problem in Connecticut that have passed the House and Senate.
Updates from the First District:
	•	I recently presented the family of a deceased East Hartford Veteran with his service medals and I presented Korean War Veteran, Carl Jacobs, with his service medals, including the Purple Heart. If you or a loved one needs help obtaining your medals, please call my Hartford office at 860-278-8888.
	•	I also held a panel discussion on the impact of Hurricane Maria both in Puerto Rico and here in Connecticut. It has been nearly a year since this disaster and the road to recovery is still far from over. According to the New England Journal of Medicine, more than 4,500 Americans died as a result of this storm and according to a survey by UConn, as many as 13,000 fled to Connecticut in its aftermath. We must commit more federal resources to help the island and our fellow citizens recover.
If you ever need assistance or have a question, please feel free to call my Hartford office at 860-278-8888 or send me an email.
Best wishes,

Reed's 'Problem Solvers' buck GOP leadership, propose new House Rules- Buffalo News  
Editorial: Reed pushes for congressional sanity- Buffalo News
 

Dear Neighbor,
The bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, which I co-chair, recently released a proposal to “Break the Gridlock” in Washington. 
House rules will be up for debate in January, and our proposals will ensure power isn’t just in the hands of party leaders. By doing so, it will allow good ideas to be voted on.
Our proposals:
	•	Encourage and reward bipartisan governing
	•	Foster passage of bills to solve constituent priorities
	•	Increase accountability and transparency
	•	Elect a Speaker that is representative to the whole body
For more in depth details of “Break the Gridlock” proposal, visit here.
It is time for Congress to start working for the American people again.
The Problem Solvers Caucus have put forward ideas related to common sense healthcare solutions, stabilizing the individual health insurance marketplace, our crumbling infrastructure, and our nation’s DREAMERs and border security. Unfortunately, none of these ideas ever received a vote due to the restrictive House rules. 
Until next time,
 
Tom

Congresswoman Beatty Marks Black Women’s Equal Pay Day
Today, August 7, 2018, is Black Women’s Equal Pay Day, the day black women will have to work up until to make what white men made in 2017 alone. As a strong supporter and advocate for equal pay, U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) issued the following statement:
“Right now, black women earn 38 percent less than white men and 21 percent less than white women. If the trend continues, black women will not achieve equal pay until 2248. We cannot wait that long—we need equal pay for equal work right now! That is why this Black Women’s Equal Pay Day, I am joining with women and men across America to ‘lean in’ to encourage companies everywhere to commit to equal pay, because when women succeed, America succeeds!”  
￼
 Congresswoman Beatty urges Central Ohioans to join the ‘Lean In’ movement to make equal pay for equal work a reality for all Americans. (August 7, 2018)
 
Congresswoman Beatty also produced a short video highlighting the importance of Black Women’s Equal Pay Day, please visit her official YouTube page to watch. For more information on the ‘lean in’ movement, go to www.LeanIn.org, and be sure to join the conversation online by using #38PercentCounts.

Dear Friend,
It is hard to believe summer is almost over.  Soon it will be time for students to return to school.  As you begin purchasing school supplies, uniforms, and clothes, it is never too late to get your children mentally ready.  Take time during these last days of summer to begin reading with your children and combine math and science enrichment with fun activities.  As a member on the Education and the Workforce Committee, education is a top priority.  It is exciting to see educators, administrators, parents, and the community making the education of our children a priority as well.  Enjoy the rest of your summer! 
Sincerely,  ￼ Marcia L. Fudge Member of Congress 


LEGISLATIVE CORNER
Bills I Introduced  
Parent PLUS Loan Improvement Act (H.R. 6280) - Makes college more affordable by lowering the cost of Parent PLUS loans.  The bill makes changes to the current Parent PLUS Loan Program by: (1) reducing and capping loan interest rates; (2) removing the current 4% loan origination fees; (3) requiring loan counseling for all borrowers; and (4) making PLUS loans eligible for the income-based repayment program.
 
Go to High School, Go to College (H.R. 4435) - Allows the use of Pell grant funding for transferable college credits, including core requirements students complete in an early college program offered by an accredited Institution of Higher Education (IHE).  Currently, too many students enrolled in post-secondary education do not earn credentials or degrees.  Expanding access to early college high schools will increase college completion rates and ultimately reduce the time and cost of earning a college degree.
 
Bills I Cosponsored 
The Aim Higher Act (H.R. 6543) - Reauthorizes the Higher Education Act giving every student the opportunity to earn a debt-free degree, addresses the rising costs of college, protects every student's right to feel safe on campus, and improves successful completion of higher education programs.  The Aim Higher Act also protects students, veterans, and taxpayers from predatory for-profit institutions, and assists colleges and universities in their efforts to improve student outcomes.
 
Bills I Opposed 
Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019 (Bipartisan Budget Act) (H.R. 5895) - I voted NO because this bill allowed an $18 billion increase for both defense and non-defense discretionary spending between fiscal years 2018 and 2019.  The majority devoted $4.8 billion, more than a quarter of that increase, to the Department of Homeland Security, which, in my opinion, leaves nothing for critical programs such as our schools, job training programs, Pell Grants, or improving access to quality, affordable health care.  This bill also makes cuts to energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, rolls back clean water protections, and blocks National Oceans Policy.
 
Insisting that the Department of Justice fully comply with the requests, including subpoenas, of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the subpoena issued by the Committee on the Judiciary relating to potential violations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act by personnel of the Department of Justice and related matters (H.Res. 970) - I voted NO because this resolution is a dangerous, partisan intervention into an ongoing Department of Justice criminal investigation.  This resolution threatens that process and, while Congress should conduct oversight of the Executive Branch, we should not jeopardize or politicize the justice system.
A Seat at the Table
On July 18, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, appointed me to serve on the 2018 Farm Bill Conference Committee.  This committee will work to resolving the differences in the House and Senate versions of the Farm Bill.  The Constitution requires that the House and Senate approve the same bill before it is presented to the President for a signature or veto.
The Farm Bill is a five-year law governing a majority of the nation's agricultural and nutrition assistance programs.  As a member of the committee, I look forward to working with my colleagues in both the House and Senate to produce a final bill that addresses conservation, especially in areas like the Great Lakes; protects the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly referred to as Food Stamps; and provides certainty for U.S. farmers and ranchers.

2017 - 2018

New Markets Tax Credits 
I have always been a strong advocate for New Markets Tax Credits (NMTC), which are essential to the revitalization of communities in Ohio and across the United States. The tax credits distributed through the NMTC Program provide community organizations with the capital they need to grow and sustain local businesses and create jobs.  I am proud the 11th District has benefited from $303.5 million in NMTC since 2009. 
 
BUILD Transportation (formerly TIGER) Grants awarded in OH-11 
Funds were awarded through the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Discretionary Grant program (now BUILD - Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development - Program), which strives to invest in critical road, rail, transit and port projects across the nation.  I have written letters of support for TIGER and BUILD grants, and am pleased OH-11 has received more than $44 million in grant funds from the U.S. Department of Transportation since 2009.  

SAVE THE DATE: 
Less than 80 days until the 2018 NEOSTREAM Conference!  
The 2nd Annual NEOSTREAM Conference is LESS THAN 80 DAYS away!
In the Spring of 2017, I hosted the inaugural Northeast Ohio Science, Technology, Recreation, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (NEOSTREAM) Conference in conjunction with Cuyahoga Community College (Tri-C).  Over the course of three days, approximately 930 students, educators, community members and executives participated in innovative workshops, hands-on demonstrations and tailored lectures.  
As a member of Congress on the House Education and the Workforce Committee, I am hosting this event to bring STREAM awareness and opportunities to middle school students; provide educators with tools to enhance their curriculum; and encourage community support and awareness of STREAM educational and job opportunities.
My staff and I are gearing up for NEOSTREAM 2018 on the campuses of Cuyahoga Community College (Tri-C) and Cleveland State University, October 25-27, 2018.  We are hoping for even greater participation and more activities this year. 
Stay tuned as we update conference details in the coming weeks.  NEOSTREAM 2018 will have something to offer every member of your family and our community! #NEOSTREAM2018!

Town Hall Highlights
I thank everyone who attended the town hall meeting July 28.  I enjoyed speaking with you all and answering your questions.  It was my pleasure to give you the opportunity to express your concerns and try to ease the frustrations we all feel under the current administration.  
Here are a few issues concerning OH-11 constituents: 
On the new 3D blueprint for plastic guns that would have been available August 1 online, but for a last minute federal court order... 
""The majority controls the legislation that goes on the floor.  If we get back the majority in November, we will change [gun regulations].""  
On continuing to protect the drug pricing program that provides care for low income and rural areas from greedy drug companies that are trying to expand...
""I will.  Unfortunately, this administration has attempted to rollback any semblance of holding drug companies accountable.  Drug prices are starting to inch up just like healthcare.  I talk to the drug companies all the time and let them know I don't support what they do."" 
On Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority rent increases...
""All public housing facilities and associations need to come together collectively and say, 'We won't stand for this!'  They're not going to pay attention to just Cleveland. In addition, with the new tax bill, they will not build more public housing.  We project that there will be 200,000 less public housing [nationwide] over the next few years."" [Source: Novogradac & Company, LLP - Certified Public Accountants]
On the seemingly quiet voice of the Democrats...
""I hear that all the time. We are noisy, but they don't want us on TV.  They want entertainers.  I don't entertain.  I want to talk about the issues.  We hold press conferences and they don't cover them.""
For the complete Q & A visit @repmarcialfudge on Facebook.

￼
""Thank you for cosponsoring the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act (S. 693/H.R. 1676), which would ensure an adequate, well-trained palliative care workforce through workforce training, education and awareness, and enhanced research."" - C.D. 44128  
￼
""As a medical professional and constituent, I am writing to thank you for your work in supporting the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act.  This legislation would remove per-country caps on immigration and simplify the process for those seeking an employment based visa and green card.  Hospitalists who immigrate from India and China, are integral parts of the healthcare system.  Despite their importance, they often face decades long backlogs waiting for their green card.  This legislation takes important steps in beginning to resolve these issues.  I appreciate your efforts in combating this issue facing medical professionals and their families."" 
- V.S. 44124
 
￼
""Thank you for investing more in the arts!  I am pleased to see the third consecutive year of bipartisan funding increases for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) in the FY 2018 budget agreement passed in March.  The House continued to support that investment with a proposal for another $2 million increase in the FY 2019 bill approved in committee this month!  This House proposal matches the record support of 166 members of Congress who asked for at least $155 million in the FY 2019 bill in the bipartisan appropriations letter led by the late Rep. Slaughter and Rep. Lance.

Has the 115th Congress Helped – or Hurt – You?
Dear Friend, 
Many of my constituents have shared their concerns with me about their economic situation – they’re understandably concerned about issues that affect them directly, like stagnating wages and the rising cost of health care. Most American households are finding it harder and harder to make ends meet. 
I, like most of my colleagues in Congress, want to help the millions of Americans who are struggling to make ends meet and find more financial security.  I’ve been frustrated over the last year and a half because I believe that so much of the Congressional Republican Leadership's agenda runs counter to that goal. As I see it, they’ve spent the last year and a half pushing policies that would hurt – not help – most Americans when it comes to “pocketbook” issues like health care, jobs, wages, the economy, and taxes. 
HEALTH CARE
A lot of the House’s attention last year was spent on attempting to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA or “Obamacare”), legislation enacted in 2010 to make health care more affordable and provide health insurance coverage to more Americans. 
Republicans introduced several ACA repeal and replace bills. These bills would have resulted in more than 15 million Americans losing affordable, high-quality health insurance; in millions of Americans paying more money for less health insurance coverage; and in increased premiums and other health care expenses for millions of Americans - especially those who are older, sicker, or have pre-existing conditions.  
In addition, many of these bills would have eliminated the ACA’s expansion of Medicaid to single, low-income, working-age adults; reduced the amount of money states would receive in future years to take care of their low-income children, seniors, and disabled citizens; and/or reduced future funding for Medicare, reducing the program’s solvency.
Most of the House and Senate’s so-called “reform” bills all had something else in common: they cut hundreds of billions of dollars in funding for federal programs to provide affordable high-quality health insurance – while cutting hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes on health-related companies and the wealthy. I found this trade-off morally repugnant and, needless to say, unacceptable. I believe that the ACA has helped millions of Americans -- and that we should fix the Affordable Care Act's shortcomings, not replace the ACA with plans which provide less help for those who need it most and a windfall for those who need it least.
In the end, none of the ""repeal and replace"" bills ever attracted the majority of votes needed to pass, so most of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act remain in effect.  
TAXES
In December 2017, Congress enacted HR 1 (the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”), legislation making dozens of changes in federal tax laws – which the non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimated would increase the national debt by nearly $1.5 Trillion over the next 10 years. 
The big winners from the new tax law are corporations and wealthy Americans. Many taxpayers will get some modest temporary tax relief from HR 1 - in one famous case, a woman in Pennsylvania is getting $1.50 a week - but soon (after 2025), households with incomes of $75,000 or less will end up worse off, and only households with incomes of $200,000 or more will be better off as a result of this tax bill. The bill’s inflation adjustment eventually claws back what little tax relief most households will receive under HR 1.  Moreover, while HR 1 disproportionately benefited corporations and the rich, it won’t significantly increase long-term economic growth or raise workers’ wages.    It will, however, reduce the federal government’s ability to address the biggest problems we face today (like opioid addiction, workforce skills and participation, a shortage of affordable housing, and the doubling of the number of older Americans).  But that’s not all. House Republicans have announced a plan for another massive tax cut bill, to be voted on in September. It would make permanent the provisions of HR 1 that are scheduled to expire in 2025, providing modest tax relief to middle income households but still primarily benefiting the wealthiest ones. Making the expiring provisions of HR 1 permanent would also increase the national debt (by about $600 billion over the next ten years) -- unless other programs that provide important support for those same families are subsequently cut.  An accountant from Pennsylvania recently wrote that the increased health care costs for small businesses resulting from attacks on the Affordable Care Act far exceed the tax breaks they’re getting. I think a lot of Americans are going to be in the same boat. 
MORE OF THE SAME?
Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act are still at risk going forward. As in previous years, the Republicans on the House Budget Committee approved a Federal Budget which includes proposed cuts in Medicare and Medicaid accompanied by radical changes that would end those programs’ guarantees of health care for low-income, elderly, and disabled Americans: it would cut $1.5 Trillion from Medicaid and ACA programs – and an additional $537 billion from Medicare. Cuts of this magnitude would eliminate health insurance coverage for millions of Americans and impose heavier financial burdens on millions of additional low- and moderate-income Americans, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.  This latest budget is consistent with its predecessors; a recent report by a House Democratic Task Force documented the widespread presence of large tax and health care cuts in House Republican budgets over a number of years. 
THE BIG CHOICE
The two parties in the House have proposed very different visions for creating jobs, raising wages, and getting health care costs under control: 
	•	In 2016, House Republican Leaders announced a comprehensive legislative agenda they planned to pursue in the 115th Congress. The House spent a number of months last year considering legislation to enact two planks of that agenda – repealing and replacing the ACA and changing federal tax law. The Speaker supported the American Health Care Act, arguing that repeal and replacement of the ACA would give consumers more choices and lower premiums while protecting people with pre-existing conditions. The Speaker asserted that their tax changes would make Americans’ taxes simpler, fairer, and flatter - and that they would reduce the taxation of savings and investment in order to increase economic growth, create new jobs, and increase Americans wages.
It makes sense that reforming Federal taxes and fixing our broken health insurance system could help many households. Figuring out which changes to make can be complicated, however, especially since those choices determine who will benefit and who will suffer. Unfortunately, a lot of legislation before Congress is influenced by powerful special interests, who spend a lot of time and money to make sure they benefit as much as possible. 
I opposed the ACA repeal bill, the so-called tax “reform” bill, and the 2019 House budget because I believed they would disproportionately benefit corporations and the rich at the expense of the vast majority of my constituents. I believe that the Affordable Care Act should be improved, not repealed – and that federal taxes should be reformed to put more money in working families’ pockets while making corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share. 
	•	Last year, House Democrats announced a very different legislative agenda, one we believe would offer “A BETTER DEAL” for the American People. 
We have plans to ensure a living wage and higher wages and incomes for American workers.  We also have plans to enable all Americans to acquire the skills and knowledge they need to get good jobs or move up and earn a better living. In addition, we believe the federal government should invest more in our nation’s crumbling infrastructure, stop the outsourcing of American jobs, and crack down on unfair job-killing foreign imports. 
We also pledge to keep the promises made to millions of workers who earned Social Security, Medicare, and pensions so that they – and future generations – can retire with dignity. 
Finally, we have plans to lower the costs of living for American families –like the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs and child care – and to crack down on monopolies and special interests that use their economic power to influence government policies and charge consumers, workers, and small businesses more. 
You may want to ask yourself ‘Am I better off now, or am I getting a raw deal?’ and ‘Which agenda represents a better deal for me?’
I will continue to do everything I can to enact policies that I believe provide a better deal for the American People. 
It continues to be an honor and a pleasure to serve you.  Please feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions or to request assistance in dealing with the federal government by going to my web site, http://doyle.house.gov/. You can also call my office at 202-225-2135.   Until next time, I am  ￼  Mike Doyle Member of Congress

If you are having trouble viewing this message or would like to share it on a social network, you can view the message online.￼

￼ ￼ ￼ ￼
Important news from this past week:
	•	Congratulations to Marsha Blackburn on winning her primary last week. I look forward to working with her in the United States Senate to continue our Republican majority and deliver conservative results for the American people – including lower taxes, fewer regulations and conservative judges.
	•	Congratulations to Bill Lee on his primary victory. As I’ve often said, there is no better job than being governor of your home state, especially if that state is Tennessee. I look forward to working with Bill to continue Governor Haslam’s excellent leadership of our state.
	•	President Trump signed into law a bill I helped write and pass—with the support of Ivanka Trump—that will help the 200,000 Tennesseans who participate in career and technical education programs learn the skills they need to find good jobs. The need for skilled workers is the issue I hear most from employers in Tennessee.
	•	Millions of Americans who are between jobs and who pay for their own insurance will welcome an extended option for lower-cost, short-term, renewable policies that the Trump Administration provided last week.
Republican Congress Getting Results for Tennesseans:
	•	Legislation to give our troops at Ft. Campbell a pay raise is headed to the president’s desk. The bill, which authorizes $716 billion for the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, also supports important programs at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge to strengthen our national security.
	•	The Senate passed legislation to help fund five Land and Water Conservation Fund projects in Tennessee - three National Park Service projects in Tennessee national parks; one U.S. Forest Service project in the Cherokee National Forest; and one Forest Legacy project, the Skinner Mountain Forest. The bill will also begin to reduce the maintenance backlog at our national parks - helping restore campgrounds, trails, and roads - as I work with my colleagues to pass the Restore our Parks Act, which would do more to restore national parks, including the Smokies, than anything that has happened in the last half century.
	•	The Senate unanimously passed my legislation to help bring new animal drugs to Tennessee farmers and ranchers, families, and veterinarians to keep our pets healthy, prevent outbreaks of disease, and protect our food supply.
 
Delivering a boost to career and technical education in Tennessee
￼
I was at the White House last week with President Trump as he signed into law legislation I helped pass to fund the programs that train skilled workers -- for example, a Tennessee high school student wanting to become a computer coder, or an adult going back to school to learn about commercial construction. At a time when our economy is booming, what I hear most often from Tennessee employers is that they need more skilled workers and this new law delivers a boost to more than 200,000 Tennesseans who participate in career and technical education programs and help put them on the path towards the middle class. I’m grateful to Ivanka Trump for her work on this bill.
 
Reducing health care costs: focusing on administrative burden 
The Senate health committee I chair continues its work into reducing health care costs. Last week, I chaired a hearing on reducing the cost of administrative tasks – which include everything from the time doctors and nurses spend filling out insurance claims to buying software for an electronic health records system. I talked about Dr. Reid Blackwelder, a Kingsport family physician who chairs a residency program with three clinics in Tri-Cities. Dr. Blackwelder is required to have an electronic health records system because he sees Medicare and Medicaid patients, but unfortunately, electronic health records systems have ended up being something physicians too often dread, rather than a tool that’s useful. Dr. Blackwelder still can’t see a patient’s records from the hospital he can see out his office window.

Last week, I had a great time visiting Maryville College, which is celebrating its 200th anniversary next year. My parents met there in the fall of 1931, so I brought along a few pictures of them to share. Thank you to President Tom Bogart for giving me a tour of their old stomping grounds.
 
 
 
 
President Trump’s zero tariffs goal is exactly the right policy 
￼
It's time to do what President Trump said last week -- zero tariffs is exactly the right policy. That's what we did with the North American Free Trade Agreement. Over 15 years, we worked to reach nearly zero tariffs on many products, and now it's time to get rid of the steel and aluminum tariffs which are driving up the cost of cars and hurting the 136,000 Tennesseans who work in the automotive industry. You can watch my interview with Fox News here or by clicking on the above image.

It was great talking to Tyler Wombles. Tyler is a junior at the University of Tennessee from Loudon and is the Managing Editor of the school’s newspaper, the University of Tennessee Daily Beacon. You can read the story he wrote on our visit here.
 
 
 
 
Working to fill potholes, maintain trails and campgrounds, repair visitors’ centers at the Smokies and other national parks
￼
I joined Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Wednesday to build support for the bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act to help address the nearly $12 billion in deferred maintenance at our national parks—that means filling potholes, fixing bathrooms, maintaining trails and campgrounds, repairing visitors’ centers and restoring our 417 national parks, including the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, so Americans can enjoy them. This legislation could cut in half the deferred maintenance backlog in our parks over the next five years. The good news is that Republicans and Democrats who often disagree are in near unanimous agreement to fix our national parks, and we agree that it should happen this year.
Click here to see more about when Sec. Zinke and I looked at deferred maintenance needs in the Smokies.
 
Supporting Tennessee agriculture and expanding rural broadband
The Senate approved legislation last week that will help support Tennessee’s agriculture industry and rural communities. This legislation is good news for Tennessee’s farmers because it funds the Farm Service Agency, Department of Agriculture Rural Development programs, and agricultural research at Tennessee universities. It also includes $30 million to help expand broadband to rural communities

Dear Friend,
The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is celebrating its 65th year as the key resource for America’s small businesses and entrepreneurs.  Since its founding on July 30, 1953, the SBA has connected small businesses with access to funding, mentoring, counseling, and when disaster strikes, support to recover and get back to business.  
In New Jersey, the SBA set a record of $869 million SBA guaranteed loans last year, and is on pace to approve $900 million in SBA loan guarantees in the Garden State this year.  These loan approvals have helped create and retain more than 13,000 jobs locally. 
As your Congressman I was honored to join SBA’s Region 2 Advocate Christine M. Myers, SBA’s Lead Business Opportunity Specialist Dominick Belfiore, local elected officials and Chamber of Commerce representatives on August 1st for a tour of small businesses in Phillipsburg and Somerville. 
Here are a few photographs of my day.  
Best personal wishes, ￼  Leonard Lance

￼

  We Want to Hear From You   
Dear  : 
There are many important priorities and policies I'm championing in Congress that affect communities across the Dallas Fort Worth area. Helping small business grow and prosper is one of those areas that are important to me. By traveling to places of work across the Metroplex, I get to see how their operations run and what resources they need. 
That is why I will be introducing legislation this Fall to help small businesses grow and prosper. This will benefit women, veterans, and minorities, who represent the largest share of new small business start-ups in the country, but still face institutional barriers. 
These efforts in Texas will assist in growing these businesses, which will contribute to a healthier economy in the Metroplex, with more jobs opportunities and fewer financial constraints. 
Small businesses are only one of the many issues I want to tackle in the Fall. But I firmly believe that the best way I can represent our community in Congress, is to hear directly from you. I want to know what interests you and what issues you want to learn more about my work on. If you could please take a minute to fill out the survey below, my staff and I can better address these issues.

8/7/18 10:28,COMING SOON…,"News from Representative Tom Emmer
￼
  
￼ 
Dear Friend,  
Congress has taken important steps to close the skills gap in our nation’s workforce to create one that is better equipped for the 21st century. And just last week, the President signed the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (H.R. 2353), into law. This legislation reauthorizes the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, which:   
	•	Authorizes more than $1 billion for states each year to fund vocational and trade programs;
	•	Benefits more than 11 million students;
	•	Shifts the focus of vocational programs toward student outcomes; and,
	•	Enhances skills training to better match the jobs available in a modern economy.
Manufacturing is one of the top two drivers of the economy in Minnesota’s Sixth Congressional District, so it is critical to ensure this industry continues to be successful today and long-term. One year ago, I hosted a summit with educators, business owners and community leaders to discuss potential solutions to the skills gap crisis facing Minnesota, and our nation as a whole. 
￼ 
Congressman Emmer speaks at the first “Addressing the Skills Gap Summit” last year. 
Since then, I have continued to stay engaged on the issue, touring educational institutions and learning all about the incredible career and technical programs they offer. I meet with business owners, school leaders, and representatives from different industries to learn about the devastating impact the skills gap is having on our economy and workforce. The current imbalance between skills and job openings has left many critical jobs unfilled and numerous Americans without the career skills they need, and it is clear a disconnect remains.  
So I plan to host a second summit this fall with the intention of advancing partnerships to address our workforce shortages. 
Our state and communities, along with our teaching professionals and parents, know what is best for our kids which is why I want to continue the conversation. 
Stay tuned for more information on my office’s second workforce summit by following me on Facebook and Twitter.  

Sincerely, 
￼

8/7/18 10:24,Congressman Panetta: August Congressional Update," 
￼￼ 

 Dear Neighbor,  Legislative Update  This month and every month, I work to honor and fight for our nation’s principles, values, and laws.  I am proud to have introduced recently the following legislation that I believe upholds the values that we hold dear on the central coast of California: 
	1.	I introduced the bipartisan No NATO Withdrawal Act to reassert Congressional support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Many of the military installations located in our district on the Central Coast provide support for the mission of NATO.This bipartisan bill would prohibit funds from being used to withdraw the United States from NATO.Additionally, it states that it is the policy of the United States to remain a member in good standing of NATO, to reject any efforts to withdraw from the alliance, and to continue to work with member nations to ensure each country spends at least 2 percent of its GDP on defense spending, in accordance with the 2014 NATO Wales Summit agreement.  
	2.	Co-Introduced a bipartisan package with fellow members of the Problem Solvers Caucus to break the gridlock in Congress through making common-sense changes to the House Rules. The proposed rule changes will allow for more debate and votes, leading to more bipartisan bills and amendments to come to the House floor.We have an obligation to address the issues that are important to our constituents. This helps us fulfill our responsibility and pass lasting solutions to benefit our neighbors on the Central Coast.  
	3.	Co-Sponsored the bipartisan VET-2-FARM Act which invests in our next generation of farmers by paving the way for veterans to pursue their American Dream in agriculture.Our district is home to a large veteran population and a thriving agriculture industry.This legislation seeks to give veterans more opportunity as they transition out of the military and begin productive careers as farmers and ranchers in our communities.  
	4.	Co-Introduced bipartisan legislation to amend the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to require Congressional approval before the President adjusts imports that are determined to threaten to impair national security. The Administration imposed trade barriers on several U.S.trading partners.These policies and tariffs have the potential to negatively impact American industries and consumers, including our district’s $5 billion agriculture economy.  
	5.	I joined my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to urge the Administration to ensure adequate compensation within the $12 billion aid package for specialty crop farmers impacted by tariffs.As the representative of the Salad Bowl of the World, I believe that the Administration must stop these shortsighted trade actions before the agriculture industry loses complete access to key international markets.  
	6.	Co-Introduced the bipartisan STEM and Trade in Schools Act to improve technical education and expand teacher grant opportunities to ensure our educators are equipped with the training and expertise needed to prepare our future workforce.  
	7.	Co-Introduced bipartisan legislation to expand opportunities for seasonal employees of the National Park Service (NPS) to work in multiple parks each year.This was done in response to the Administration’s policy change that limited such movement. Pinnacles National Park in our district benefits from dedicated public servants who are committed to improving access to parks on the Central Coast.
 Mobile Office Hours in August  Mobile office hours are an opportunity for members of the community to meet with Congressional staff, and are offered in addition to meetings in the Salinas and Santa Cruz Congressional offices.  Congressional staff members will be available to assist with issues concerning Social Security, Medicare, federal employee retirement, immigration services, veterans' services, passports, searching for military records, and any other federal matters.  To schedule a meeting, please call our Salinas District Office: (831) 424-2229.  Soledad Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Time: 10:00 a.m.  – 1:00 p.m. Soledad City Council Chambers 485 Main Street Soledad, CA 93960

Friday: Teach-In Town Hall Meeting & Interfaith Vigil Service
Dear Lindsey,
On the one-year anniversary of the murder of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville and on the eve of a neo-Nazi March in the Nation’s Capital, I'm writing to invite you to join me and Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D.C.) for a regional Town Hall Meeting Teach-In on the growth of extremist white supremacist groups and effective ways communities are organizing to push back against the spread of hate this Friday, August 10, 2018, from 3:00 p.m. – 6:00 p.m.(doors open at 2:30 p.m.), at Washington Hebrew Congregation (3935 Macomb St. NW, Washington, DC 20016). The town hall-style event features some of the nation’s leading experts on the history of the neo-Nazi movement and how to counter it. There will be time for audience participation. Members of the public are invited to remain after the teach-in to hear from interfaith leaders from 6:00 p.m. - approximately 7:15 p.m. Refreshments will be served throughout the teach-in and vigil.
Reverend William J. Barber, II, president and lecturer of Repairers of the Breach, will deliver the keynote address, and Leonard Zeskind, Founder of the Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights, will explain the current context of far-right organizing and vigilante violence.
The teach-in will feature a panel discussion, entitled “Developing Effective Responses to Resurgent White Supremacy.” The panel will feature Dr. Wes Bellamy, Vice Mayor, Charlottesville, VA; Dr. Randy Blazak, Oregon Coalition Against Hate Crime; Lecia Brooks, Outreach Director, Southern Poverty Law Center; Monica Hopkins, Executive Director, American Civil Liberties Union of Washington, D.C.; and Tony McAleer, Board Chair, Life After Hate.
Our Teach-In will provide essential information on how communities across America are responding to growing hate violence and white supremacist ideology. It will provide our community the chance to deliver a unified response to the Unite the Right rally being staged in Washington, D.C. this weekend. We stand together and we stand strong.
To learn more about the event and how to RSVP, click here.
My key goal for this weekend is to make sure no one gets hurt or killed confronting the racists on the National Mall. But that does not mean we have to be silent about this offense against democratic values of pluralism and toleration.
Please join us for this important educational event. I hope to see you there and, as always, send you all best wishes.

Dear Friend, 
The Reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund
I recently sent a letter with a group of 13 bipartisan colleagues urging the Senate Majority and Minority Leaders to permanently reauthorize and fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). This program has supported more than 42,000 state and local projects across the nation and for more than half a century has invested over $268 million in conserving Colorado's lands, water and open spaces, and protecting outdoor recreational opportunities. The LWCF is the crown jewel of conservation programs and will unfortunately expire on September 30th if action is not taken.  
Read the letter in full here. 
Senate Passes the National Defense Authorization Act
I voted in favor of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2019 last week. Passing this legislation gives a 2.6% pay raise to all members of the Armed Forces, the largest increase in nine years. With Colorado having some of the highest numbers of men and women in uniform, the strengthening of all our military bases and the millions of dollars provided for Fort Carson expansion, opportunities, and development, will greatly benefit Coloradans bravely serving our country.  
You can view my NDAA statement here. 
Urging President Trump to Continue Maximum Pressure Toward North Korea
Before the Administration announced it was implementing additional sanctions against North Korea, I sent a letter with three of my colleagues in the Senate urging President Trump to continue the doctrine of maximum pressure against North Korea. I'm seriously concerned about the alleged continued development of nuclear and ballistic missile programs in North Korea, which is why this letter suggests imposing additional sanctions against the regime and resuming joint military exercises with South Korea.
Read the letter here. 
Bipartisan Russia Sanctions Package
Last week, I introduced the Defending American Security from Kremlin Aggression Act of 2018. This legislation will impose further economic sanctions against the Kremlin, taking strong action against Vladimir Putin's Russia attempts to undermine the United States. Included in this package is my legislation to require determination from the State Department on designation of the Russia Federation as a state sponsor of terrorism.  
Read more about my legislation here.  
Passage of the Southwest Chief Train Services Amendment 
Senator Bennet and I secured a big win for Southeastern Colorado last week when we were able to secure an amendment in the THUD appropriations bill to help maintain Amtrak train services along the Southwest Chief route. This amendment sets aside funding for route improvements and enhancements to help ensure the Southwest Chief continues to run through Colorado.
You can watch my video statement here.  
Meeting with Coloradans in Washington

Everyday I'm in Washington, DC I look forward to meeting with Coloradans to discuss a variety of their issues and concerns. This past week, I met with the Florissant Fossil Beds Volunteers discussing the great work they're doing to preserve Colorado's fossil deposits.  
Below are pictures from this week's meeting.

DISTRICT
 
Dear Friends, 
District Work Periods are a time for Members of Congress to travel throughout their districts and visit with their constituents so we can better represent you in the nation's capital. I look forward to traveling to our towns and cities from Austin to Houston this month and hope to see you there. 
Below is a review of last week: 
School Safety
Our schools should be a place where our children develop the skills to realize their hopes and dreams – not a setting for our most tragic nightmares. 
Unfortunately, this is a concern at the forefront for all of us.  Our schools have become targets for shootings and other acts of violence.  From Columbine, to Sandy Hook, to Parkland, to our own backyard in Santa Fe, we have seen shocking images of students running for their lives. 
As a father of five, school safety is very personal to me. Ensuring the security and well-being of our students and teachers is an obligation for us. To protect young Americans, I introduced the Securing Our Schools Act.  This bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to draft a strategy for the Department to assist with securing our schools from active shooters, acts of terrorism, and other threats. It also ensures that DHS grant programs can be used to enhance school security and authorizes the Office of Academic Engagement to serve as the liaison with schools to share information on available DHS programs and assistance they can access.  I am also a cosponsor of the STOP School Violence Act and the Fix NICS Act, which both passed through Congress in the final Omnibus package in March. 
￼ 
Due to my work in Congress, I was asked to deliver opening remarks at the day-long conference at Pflugerville ISD [pictured above] with Austin Regional Intelligence Center (ARIC), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), local law enforcement, and ISD staff to continue the conversation of preventing mass casualty events in our schools. 
Bastrop Chamber of Commerce Luncheon   I delivered the keynote speech at the Bastrop Chamber of Commerce luncheon. Thank you to the Chamber for inviting me to provide an update on our economy, the benefits of our new tax code, the increased threats of adversary nations and how we are combating them, and the passage of the biggest defense budget since WWII. It is a great honor to serve the city of Bastrop in Congress and I am proud to continue working towards leaving a better America for our kids and grandkids.
￼ 
￼ 
Agriculture Roundtable  
Thank you to our farmers and ranchers who provide our country with the safest and most abundant food in the world. I hosted a roundtable in Katy, Texas with our agriculture community to hear from them, answer their questions, and provide an update on what we are doing in Washington to put more power back in their hands.
￼ 
Industry and New Ulm 
When I have the opportunity to travel back to Texas for District Work Periods, I always enjoy visiting all of the cities and towns from Austin to Houston.  Two of the many towns I traveled last week were Industry and New Ulm to receive an update from them and learn how I can better represent them in Congress.  I specifically met with Industry Mayor Mable Meyers and Austin County Commissioner Bobby Rinn to better understand the challenges they face as a community.  
￼ 
  
Roundtable on Opioids and Human Trafficking 
Republicans in Congress have been working on safeguarding our communities from two of today's emerging threats: the opioid crisis and human trafficking.  To continue our work, I hosted two roundtable discussions with Congressman Knight - an 18-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department and member of the Congressional Law Enforcement Caucus and Heroin Task Force - on how we can further combat these two issues.  We were joined by local government officials, law enforcement agencies, and representatives from local non-profit organizations to discuss how we need to all work together to enact many of the bold policies Congress has been advancing in the House. 
Congressman Knight and I then wrote a joint op-ed about how we are working to end human trafficking and combat the opioid crisis. You can click here or on the image below to read the full op-ed. 
￼ 
Legislative Update
Last week, Members were in their districts for a District Work Period. There were no votes held. 
This week, Members will continue to be in their districts for a District Work Period. As such, there are no votes expected in the House.
As always, I encourage you to visit my website, www.mccaul.house.gov, for more information on constituent services and legislative updates. Also, follow me on Fa! cebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube to get the latest updates on my work in Washington and the 10th District of Texas. It continues to be a great honor to represent you in the United States House of Representatives.

8/7/18 9:48,This isn't folklore,"￼ 

Friends, 
You may have heard that there's a place in far West Texas where the night skies are dark as coal and rivers carve temple-like canyons in ancient limestone. This isn't simply folklore and is actually located right here in the 23rd District of Texas.
I have the distinct honor of representing in Congress a total of eight national parks and historic sites, including Big Bend National Park described above, and our San Antonio Missions. 
Unfortunately, our parks are in dire need of repairs. In fact, last year in Texas alone, the National Park Service faced over $167 million in backlogged maintenance projects, including repairs to roads, visitor facilities, trails and other park structures. 
To make matters worse, over $120 million of these overdue projects are located in the 23rd District of Texas. You don't have to be a math major to realize that's a lot of backlog and a big problem. 
It is a top priority of mine to make sure our parks remain beautiful and accessible for South and West Texas families to enjoy for generations to come. That's why I joined forces with my colleagues to introduce the bipartisan Restore Our Parks & Public Lands Act. 
Learn more in my latest Hurd on the Hill column. 
￼ 
In order to do my job to the best of my ability, I rely on regular feedback from you. Please don't hesitate to reach out to my office with any questions or concerns, and for updates on my work for you and when I'll be in your community next, I encourage you to follow me on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube.

As your representative and as a mother whose daughter attends school near Stoneman Douglas, I know that Congress hasn't done nearly enough to prevent gun violence. Now, the availability of untraceable, undetectable 3D-printed ""ghost"" guns threatens our ability to keep our children and our community safe. 

While I remain focused on expanding background checks and banning the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, this new threat requires a new response.

In Washington, I've already introduced a bill to require background checks for all purchases of ammunition. I'm a lead co-sponsor of legislation that would prevent the publication of the code required to make these ""ghost guns."" And I've already advanced my proposal to make sure the TSA is prepared for these weapons at airport checkpoints. 

Yet, I know this fight is far from over. Please take a moment to answer the question below - it will inform the work I do on your behalf in Washington. 



Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz has been working tirelessly to prevent dangerous people from printing ""ghost guns."" Do you think this should be one of her top priorities as a Member of Congress?
YES
NO
 By responding to this survey, you are authorizing the Office of Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz to send you infrequent email updates about her work in Washington on behalf of the people of South Florida.

Friends, 
This summer, I was glad to host some bright young men and women as interns in my district offices including the following students from across AL-02: Allyssa Morgan, Kimberlee Perry, Tyrese Lane, Savannah Williamson, and Spencer Andreades. Allyssa, a native of Opp, worked in my Andalusia district office. She received an Associate’s degree from Lurleen B. Wallace Community College and will attend Troy University starting this fall.
￼ 
Kimberlee served as an intern in my Dothan district office. She graduated from New Brockton High School earlier this year, and she will attend George Wallace Community College.
￼ 
Tyrese, Savannah, and Spencer all held internships in my Montgomery district office. Tyrese, a Prattville native, is a graduate of Marbury High School and is currently a student at Marion Military Institute. Savannah, from Troy, is a graduate of Pike Liberal Arts and currently attends Auburn University. Spencer is a graduate of the Montgomery Academy and now attends the University of Alabama.
These students worked very hard for our district, and I really appreciate their dedication and eagerness to serve their communities. I’m confident they will be successful in whatever paths they pursue. 
SENATE PASSES THE NDAA

Big news! The Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to ensure our men and women in uniform have the resources, equipment, and training they need. Next stop: the White House for President Trump's signature.
ECLECTIC RECEIVES COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT 
Wonderful news for Elmore County! The Town of Eclectic has received a $200,000 Community Development Block Grant to improve the roads around the industrial park where Madix, Inc. is located. Madix, which designs and manufactures displays, panels, and platforms for retail stores, intends to expand its facility and create 20 new jobs. 
I had the opportunity to visit Madix earlier this summer, and I was truly impressed by the outstanding work they're doing. I am hopeful the business will continue to grow and add even more job opportunities for the residents of Elmore County! 
THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO GROW 
￼ 
Our economy grew by 4.1% in the second quarter of 2018, marking the fastest economic expansion in this country in nearly four years. More proof that our pro-growth policies are working for the American people!

Dear Lindsey,
July was a busy month in Washington and I’d like to provide some updates on my work on behalf of Orange County residents.
Education and the Workforce Committee Examines Workflex
As our work and personal lives become busier, it is more challenging to strike a healthy work-life balance. I introduced legislation known as “Workflex,” which would give hard-working Americans access to paid leave and flexible work arrangements, like telework and predictable scheduling. We all want to spend more time with our families, pursue our hobbies, and engage in our communities. Workflex would allow employees to do those things while enjoying the benefits they seek most: paid time off and flexible work schedules.
On July 24, 2018, the House Education and Workforce Committee held a hearing on Workflex to provide Members of Congress the opportunity to speak with human resources representatives and legal experts about my bill. I participated in the hearing and discussed why I introduced this innovative paid leave legislation.
￼

Learn more about this innovative legislation here.
Staying Safe During Wildfire Season
As numerous wildfires burn throughout California, now is a good time to familiarize yourself with the resources available should disaster strike. Please visit https://walters.house.gov/wildfires to learn more. If you need assistance with a federal agency, please call my Irvine office at (949) 263-8703.
My thoughts are with those affected by the wildfires and I will continue my efforts to ensure firefighters and emergency personnel have the resources they need to protect our communities.
Putting an End to Drug-Impaired Driving
For decades, we have worked to combat drunk driving, but as the opioid crisis grows and more states legalize marijuana, we must address drugged impaired driving. According to recent studies, drug-impaired driving is involved in 43 percent of fatal crashes.
Last month, the Energy and Commerce’s Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee held a hearing to examine efforts to combat drug-impaired driving. Jennifer Harmon, Assistant Director of Forensic Chemistry at the Orange County Crime Lab, testified before the committee to discuss the efforts Orange County is taking to keep our roads safe. I’m proud of the leadership role Orange County has taken on this issue and am committed to ensuring drug impaired individuals are kept off our streets. Watch my questions from the hearing below.

Improving Care for Orange County Residents
 
￼
 
Congress has a responsibility to keep the fundamental promises it has made to America's senior citizens. In July, I proudly supported legislation that would make permanent improvements to Medicare, including a repeal of the payment cap for therapy services. I also voted to extend Medicare Advantage Special Needs Plans.
 
The House of Representatives also voted to expand access and improve the usefulness of Health Savings Accounts. These changes would allow you to lower your health costs by using untaxed dollars for deductibles, copays, and OTC medicines. You deserve greater flexibility and choice in your healthcare decisions.
 
Supporting Our Veterans and Rebuilding Our Military
Last month, the House passed the Conference Report to accompany the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019. This legislation will help our military confront the many threats facing our Nation by improving readiness, investing in defense technologies, and ensuring our service members receive appropriate training. The FY19 NDAA also provides our brave men and women in uniform with their largest pay raise nearly a decade.  Learn more here.
Additionally, the House passed a number of bills to better serve the nearly 30,000 veterans in California’s 45th district. We moved legislation to modernize the transition support services enlisted members receive to better prepare them for civilian life. These services provide veterans with the tools they need to build career success and can help prevent tragedies such as homelessness, depression, and suicide.  Learn more about these bills here.
￼
Americans are Better Off Now
Two years ago, House Republicans said there was a better way forward for our country. Since then, we have enacted a bold agenda that has improved the lives of Americans. Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and fiscal policies that make it easier to do business in America, July marked yet another month of positive U.S. economic news.

	•	U.S. Workers See Biggest Pay, Benefit Increase in 10 Years (Fox Business)
	•	Jobless Claims in U.S. Decline to Lowest Level Since 1969 (Bloomberg)
	•	Second Quarter GDP Jumps 4.1% for Best Pace in Nearly Four Years (CNBC)
House Republicans have also worked to strengthen our military, secure our communities, care for our veterans and much more. I spoke on the floor of the House last month to talk about the successes of the last two years and explain why Americans are undoubtedly better off now.

In the Community
Last week, I spent an afternoon with the Orange County Sheriff's Department (OCSD). I joined Deputy Carolynn Cuzynski on her patrol through Mission Viejo, where we discussed ways Congress can better serve law enforcement officers and keep our communities safe. Thank you to all of those serving in the OCSD for their selfless work on behalf of Orange County.

Congressman Lamborn Awarded for Upholding Conservative Values in Congress 

FreedomWorks, one of the leading conservative organizations in America, awarded Congressman Lamborn with the FreedomFighter award. FreedomWorks presented Congressman Lamborn with the award because his voting record proves he preserves individual freedom and reins in Washington's out-of-control spending. Congressman Lamborn holds a 94 percent lifetime score on the FreedomWorks Scorecard of Economic Freedom. 

￼ 
Congressman Lamborn receives the FreedomFighter award. 

In order to receive this award, FreedomWorks scored key votes for legislation across several issue areas. These votes  include disapproval for onerous Obama-era regulations, amendments to appropriations bills that sought to eliminate wasteful spending, and the tax reform bill that has provided real tax relief for Americans and unleashed incredible economic growth.
FreedomWorks issued this statement: ""Congressman Doug Lamborn is a principled defender of liberty who always fights for your conservative values. He helps stregthen the ranks of true conversavitives in the House of Representatives who fight for less government, lower taxes, and more economic freedom""

The Webster Wire
Listening to Floridians
Dear Friends: 
I had a great and productive week in the district meeting with small business owners, veterans, farmers, families, and local leaders. I was honored to attend the weekly Tuesday evening meeting of the Brooksville Kiwanis at Country Kitchen to provide their membership a legislative update of the recent actions and accomplishments of the U.S. House of Representatives thus far in the 115th Congress. 
￼  
_______________ 
While in Hernando County, I stopped by both the Veterans’ HEAT (Honoring, Empowering, Assisting, Training) Factory and K9 Partners for Patriots to see their facilities and discuss the importance of providing our veterans, especially those with service-connected injuries such as PTSD, with access to the services and care they deserve. We owe a debt to our veterans and their families for their service and sacrifices. 
￼ 
_______________ 
Every day approximately 115 Americans die after overdosing on opioids. While in Citrus County, I met with Brashear’s Pharmacy to learn how community pharmacists are helping to combat the opioid crisis. Equipping law enforcement, healthcare professionals, and local communities with the tools and resources to combat this crisis has been a priority of the U.S. House of Representatives. In June, the House passed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act to advance treatment and recovery initiatives, improve prevention, protect our communities, and bolster our efforts to fight deadly illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl. 
￼ 
_______________ 
With school almost back in session, I enjoyed delivering backpacks and school supplies to the Citrus County Education Foundation, the New Church Without Walls, and the City of Brooksville in support of our local students and teachers. 
￼ 
_______________ 
On Thursday, I met with owners, Nate and Anna Jameson of Brite Leaf Citrus Nursery in Lake Panasoffkee and toured their operations with members of the Sumter County Agricultural Alliance. It was great to hear from and visit with our local growers about the importance of agricultural in Florida. 
￼ ￼ 
_______________ 
I had a great time visiting the Bushnell Motorsports Park (BMP) and meeting owners, Bret and Rebecca Spaude. BMP is a high-speed motorsports experience and I had a great time driving a go-kart and racing around the track. 
￼ 
_______________ 
Agriculture is one of the three pillars of Florida’s economy. Farmers and ranchers all over Florida grow and raise the food that ends up on kitchen tables around the world. Last week, I met with Leon McClellan and toured his family’s dairy farm, M&B Dairy, in Lecanto. As Florida dairy farmers for several generations, I enjoyed seeing the McClellan family’s dairy operations firsthand.
￼ ￼ 
  
Your servant, 
￼
￼  Daniel Webster Member of Congress  
Constituent Corner
A constituent from Lecanto contacted my office after she received a letter from the VA’s Debt Management Center (DMC) informing her of a debt totaling more than $8,000 with no explanation. In addition to submitting an inquiry on her behalf and requesting a statement as to how the debt was created, information was provided to the family as to how to request a waiver of the debt. Because of the constituent’s advanced age, 100 years old in May, we continued to follow up on this closely, obtaining and forwarding correspondence, documents and forms between the agency and the constituent. While it took over five months to complete the process, the family was pleased to learn that DMC granted a full waiver of the debt, resulting in a refund of payments. 
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.

Come and Read It Report
Dear Texans,  
We were once asking ourselves, 'where are the jobs?' Now, thanks to House Republican's pro-growth, pro-family, and pro-American agenda, we are finding that there are an abundance of opportunities in our local communities. Right now, there are 6.7 million job openings in America - this is only the second time since 2000 that there are more jobs openings then unemployed Americans - this is a good problem to have. 
The economy is booming, people are more optimistic about their future, and families are now able to save more of their hard earned paychecks. All of this is great news, but we need to continue working on tax reform until tax cuts are permanent for all Americans. In addition to this, we need to cut the payroll tax for employees and employers so that businesses can invest money back into operations and into the economy. We've still got a lot of work to do, but I'm working hard with my colleagues to pass Tax Reform 2.0 as soon as possible. For more on this, click here to read my interview with the Lampasas Dispatch Record.  
House Committee on Financial Services 
As the vice chair of the Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade on the House Committee on Financial Services, I am proud to report that we have accomplished a tremendous amount of work so far: 
✓ 44 bills have been signed into law by President Trump 
✓ 115 bills have passed through the House 
✓ 111 hearings have been held 
✓ 18 markups have been held 
32 of the 44 bills signed into law were a part of S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, which is the most significant, pro-growth regulatory relief package in nearly a generation. With this legislation, more Americans can become first-time homeowners, can access a loan to purchase a care, and will ultimately have a pathway towards financial freedom and independence. 
I have included some articles and releases you may find interesting located on the right side of this newsletter. It is an honor and privilege to represent the people of Texas’ 25th Congressional District and as always, please reach out to me with any issues and concerns that are important to you.
In God we trust,

Kansas Common Sense  August 6, 2018
Hello,

Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.
Senate Approved Amendment to Maintain Southwest Chief Train Services On Wednesday, the Senate passed my amendment to maintain Amtrak train services along the established, long-distance passenger rail route of the Southwest Chief, which makes several stops in Kansas communities, including Lawrence, Topeka, Newton, Hutchinson, Dodge City and Garden City. 
In response to recent indications from Amtrak that it does not intend to fulfill its committed share of project costs to preserve the Southwest Chief, this amendment will compel Amtrak to make good on its promise to the Kansas Department of Transportation and local communities who raised their own matching funds, and will require Amtrak to set aside resources for maintenance and safety improvements along the route. Importantly, the amendment will halt Amtrak’s plans to substitute rail service with bus service over large segments of the route except in cases of emergency. The House must now pass this bill before it can be signed into law. 
As the divide between urban and rural communities in America continues to expand, passenger rail services like the Southwest Chief are invaluable in connecting Kansans to the rest of the country while also bringing visitors from out of state to our local communities. I applaud the bipartisan efforts to keep the Southwest Chief operational for our rural communities and will continue working with Amtrak to make certain this route remains available for the Kansans who need it. Read more about my amendment here, or in the Lawrence Journal-World here, The Hutchinson News here and the Newton Kansan here. 
Prioritizing Cybersecurity to Protect from Cyber-Attacks On Tuesday, I spoke on the Senate floor to highlight the critical cybersecurity needs of our nation and the role that the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) plays in propelling our inefficient, outdated federal IT systems into the 21st century to promote productivity and strengthen cybersecurity of our federal agencies. With examples of breaches exposing the personally identifiable information of tens of millions of Americans, like the 2015 breach within the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the ability to compromise data and networks in the federal government cannot be overstated. Private companies must do all they can to prevent hackers from gaining access to their customers’ information – the federal government and state officials must do the same. 
Additionally, I promoted the leadership demonstrated by the Kansas Intelligence Fusion Center in analyzing and comparing cyber data and intelligence among public-private partners and federal agencies to identify similarities, anomalies and ways our cyber defenses can improve. I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress and across federal agencies to provide the necessary resources to the TMF, which, used responsibly, is a vital tool for the federal government’s task of keeping our nation’s critical IT infrastructure efficient and secure. Watch my full remarks here. 
 ￼
Cosponsoring the Secure Elections Act
One of the most sacred privileges we as Americans are afforded is our freedom to participate in democracy through elections. Therefore, we must make certain our elections remain honest, secure and free from invasive influences. I am a cosponsor of the Secure Elections Act, which includes $380 million for states and local election entities to implement expert-generated cybersecurity guidelines and replace outdated and vulnerable voting machines. This legislation would help better safeguard our systems while reaffirming the leadership role states play in administering federal elections. Additionally, Congress recently approved $380 million for states to improve election security.
 
It’s clear that criminals, including foreign state actors, have interfered and continue to attempt to interfere in our elections. While much of this conversation involves bad actors manipulating hearts and minds on social media, the more pressing issue is the intrusion into our voting infrastructure and back-end systems, such as county-run voter registration rolls, which inform bad actors on how to focus their efforts. I will continue working with my colleagues to pass this important legislation.
Sending the Farm Bill to Conference This week on the Senate floor, I moved to advance the 2018 Farm Bill one step closer to the president’s desk and one step closer to providing our producers with more stability during tumultuous times for farmers and ranchers. With low commodity prices and uncertainty in trade markets, it is important that a Farm Bill be passed on time to provide a safety net for producers. The Farm Bill is also important for rural development, conservation and agricultural research programs. The Farm Bill is now in conference where the Senate and House will have a chance to work out differences between our two bills. I will continue working to pursue Kansans’ priorities in the final legislation. 
 ￼ 
Confirming Kansan Holly Teeter as Federal Judge
On Wednesday, the Senate unanimously confirmed Mrs. Holly Teeter of Lenexa to serve as a federal judge for the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. Filling this seat, which has been vacant for nearly four years, also fills the entire federal bench in Kansas. I had the pleasure of getting to know Judge Teeter during her confirmation process. Coming to the bench with both a legal and chemical engineering background, she will serve Kansas well. I introduced Judge Teeter in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee as the committee considered her nomination – watch my remarks here.

 ￼
Meeting with Olympic National Governing Bodies This week, I met with the leaders of three Olympic National Governing Bodies (NGB) at the National Headquarters and Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs to discuss ways to prevent athlete abuse within the Olympic movement. The CEOs of USA Taekwondo, USA Weightlifting and US Figure Skating shared with me the steps their NGBs have taken to create a safe environment for athletes, but more importantly, offered suggestions of steps that still need to be taken to rid these organizations of abuse. 
Our work on this important issue is far from over. I am dedicated to continuing the bipartisan approach this subcommittee has taken in its comprehensive investigation. In consultation with law enforcement, survivors and advocates, we are working closely together to identify meaningful reform in the best interests of athletes and their families. 
Hosting a Listening Tour Stop in Bonner Springs Thank you to Wyandotte County residents who shared their thoughts with me during my townhall meeting at the National Agricultural Center and Hall of Fame in Bonner Springs. Topics from our discussion included the Farm Bill and the importance of food assistance programs, the Supreme Court vacancy and the president’s nominee, election interference and legislation I’ve cosponsored to protect us from Russia’s efforts, the ongoing Mueller investigation, my support for NATO and my opposition to the ongoing tariff war. 
Thanks to the Center for hosting my visit and to University of Kansas Medical Center staff for attending to discuss the importance of NIH funding and efforts to end diseases like Alzheimer’s. 
Visiting with Kansas Bankers Association This weekend, CEOs and senior leadership representing member institutions of the Kansas Bankers Association (KBA) held their annual meeting. I was honored to join them and share my perspective on the state of community banking through my work on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. In May, Congress passed a broad piece of legislation that I co-authored to make certain community lenders are better able to best serve their customers by right-sizing federal regulation while layering on additional consumer protections. This weekend's gathering was an opportunity for me to hear directly from many of these Kansas lenders about how lending and borrowing issues can be further improved.
Congratulating Chuck Stones on his Retirement In addition to the forum, the events included a retirement reception for long-time KBA CEO Chuck Stones. I have worked alongside Chuck for many years in an effort to make certain federal law and regulations are consistent with the needs of the communities served by the banks KBA represents. I wish Chuck and his wife, Sandy, well as they enter retirement and I thank Chuck for his many years of service. Thanks also to incoming KBA CEO Doug Wareham who helped arrange my visit. 
Now Accepting 2018 Service Academy Applications Appointing Kansans to the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, N.Y.; the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.; the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo; and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, N.Y. is one of my favorite duties as a U.S. Senator. 
To review requirements and move through the application process, please download an application from my website or contact my Olathe office at 913-393-0711. All application materials are due to my Olathe office by September 7, 2018. After applications have been reviewed, applicants will be notified of interviews with my Service Academy Selection Board, which will take place on Saturday, September 22, 2018, at the Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene.

Quick Update

Dear Friends,

Due to mass communications restrictions placed on Members of Congress during the 90-day span leading up to an election, commonly known as the blackout period, I’m sorry to say I won’t be able to continue a few of our regular interactions for the next few months. However, the best way I can communicate with you is through my office’s weekly e-newsletter. Continuing my community outreach is of the utmost importance to me, and I encourage you to take a moment to sign up for my updates here. 

From the bottom of my heart, it is my honor to serve you. If you’re having problems with a federal agency or need questions answered about any of the constituent services my office provides, I invite you to contact my Monroe office at (770) 207-1776, my Milledgeville office at (478) 457-0007, or my Washington, D.C. office at (202) 225-4101.

News from Congresswoman Rosen
￼
Dear friend, 
In Nevada, opioid overdoses are one of the leading causes of drug-related deaths. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 750 Nevadans died of a drug overdose in 2017, and the numbers continue to rise.
Earlier this summer, I was proud to support and vote for the bipartisan SITSA Act, which would help stop the trafficking of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl - a narcotic that is plaguing Nevada communities. Despite some progress we’ve made on this issue, I’m concerned by what I believe is an overall lack of action and urgency from the President's policies when it comes to tackling our country's opioid epidemic.
I want to know your thoughts. Do you believe the Trump Administration is doing enough to properly address our nation's opioid epidemic?
 ￼Yes

Dear Lindsey:
This past week, we have been hard at work in California. The Trump Administration announced it will seek to rollback current fuel economy and emissions standards and nullify California's wavier. In response, I led a coalition of 60 Democratic Members in filing a resolution to oppose this move. Below is a snapshot of our effort to fight the Administration, a preview of our upcoming town halls, and a recap of our immigration town hall.

MARK LEADS EFFORT TO CONDEM TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S ROLLBACK OF FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS
Current federal fuel efficiency standards established by the Obama Administration brought federal standards on par with those set by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), thereby creating the current One National Program. The CARB standards have since been adopted by 12 other states, accounting for 35 percent of the U.S. auto market, and are on track to reduce America's oil dependence by more than 2 million barrels a day and effectively eliminate the impact of 59 million vehicles from the road by 2030. Yet, Trump wants to revoke these standards.
MARK'S STATEMENT:
""Simply put, this is an attack on clean air and public health. And as other countries keep their focus on increasing fuel efficiency and reducing emissions, we run the risk of losing out on this progress and innovation. By rolling back current fuel economy standards, the Trump Administration will cost the United States $450 billion by 2050 and increase health risks associated with air pollution. Our resolution puts the Administration on alert that this move will be met with strong and coordinated opposition across the country.""
Senator Kamala Harris introduced companion legislation in the U.S. Senate and our effort is supported by numerous environmental organizations, including the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) and the Sierra Club.
Mark served on CARB for 10 years, was Chair of transportation committees in the California State Assembly and Senate, and is currently a member of the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

8/6/18 18:33,Leading the charge to reform our food system,"Update | Monday, August 6, 2018
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
I am writing with an update on the Farm Bill — legislation that impacts health care, climate change, economic development, and the food we eat.
Our current agriculture policies pay too much to the wrong people to grow the wrong food in the wrong places. Right now, Congress is working to finalize the next Farm Bill — and we are on track to miss a critical opportunity to provide the American people with desperately-needed reforms.
In my opinion, after struggling to get a bill off the ground, House Republican leadership finally cobbled together the votes to pass what I view as a monstrous piece of legislation. The House Farm Bill would hurt family farmers and ranchers, vulnerable communities, and the environment. Meanwhile, the Senate decided to do more of the status quo, continuing lavish subsidies for corporate megafarms at the expense of small farmers and our natural resources. Now, the House and Senate are working to finalize a bill that will become law.
As the debate continues, I wanted to share with you a useful presentation from The National Journal, one of the local “Capitol Hill rags,” on this complex piece of legislation. This guide includes a comprehensive overview of the Farm Bill’s current political state of affairs. It even highlights my work with Michael Pollan to draft an alternative Farm Bill, the Food and Farm Act, which would reform our nation’s agriculture system to put food first.
As The National Journal points out, we are “leading the left’s opposition to the current Farm Bill structure.” My bill advances reforms on four principles: (1) focusing resources on those who need it most; (2) fostering innovation; (3) encouraging investments in people and the planet; and (4) ensuring access to healthy foods.
It’s my hope that Congress will go back to the drawing board and put forward the reforms our food and farm system actually needs, like those I’ve outlined in our bill. The stakes are too high to fail once again.

Courage, 
￼

Congressman Smith in Our Community 
Last week our community joined with police officers, first responders, and fire fighters from across the country in paying tribute to Officer Diego Moreno. An eight-year veteran of the Kent Police Department, Officer Moreno tragically passed away while in the line of duty last Sunday, July 22, 2018. I submitted a speech to the Congressional Record to honor the life and legacy of Officer Diego Moreno. A dedicated public servant, Officer Moreno was doing what he had done tirelessly during his years on the force: keeping his community safe. He was known for his kindness, bravery, and unrelenting commitment and dedication to the residents of his community. Officer Moreno will forever be remembered as an active and caring member of our community. He served with immense integrity, earning the respect of his colleagues as he courageously gave his all to the City of Kent. His profound sense of duty will live on as an example for us all. Officer Moreno will be greatly missed.

Legislative Update 
House Passage of the National Defense Authorization Act
Democrats fought hard and won multiple progressive outcomes in this year’s Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). As Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee, I worked hard  to ensure the men and women of our Armed Forces were taken care of and that critical priorities for our region were included in the final legislation that will be signed into law. I have included some of our most important victories in the bill below, and you can read more about the conference report HERE. 
National Defense Authorization Act Secured Funding for Highline School District for Noise Mitigation in Classrooms 
I obtained a provision in the NDAA to provide Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) funding for noise mitigation projects at schools in the Highline School District. Sea-Tac Airport is located in the center of Highline School District and many of the district’s schools are impacted by airport noise. A 2002 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Port of Seattle, the FAA, and Highline School District outlined noise mitigation for a number of Highline School District schools. The Port and the Highline School District met their portion of the funding obligation. Unfortunately, since the MOA was signed, the noise contours around the airport changed, leaving two schools in the area that does not qualify for the previously agreed upon funding. 
In May, I offered an amendment to the NDAA – pushed by Sen. Cantwell in the Senate – to fix the issue by allowing the FAA to provide noise mitigation funding to schools like Highline. The amendment will give the district access to more than $14 million in FAA Airport Improvement Grants for noise mitigation projects including replacement of doors, windows, and the installation of through-the-wall AC units, or for new construction to include noise mitigation. 
This is a great example of how all levels of government can come together to solve a problem. Highline School District has been working tirelessly to meet the terms of the agreement with the FAA to help mitigate noise pollution that the schools experience. The provision in the NDAA was crafted with bipartisan, bicameral support and will help ensure that promises made to our local schools are kept. I thank Senator Cantwell and the Port of Seattle for their advocacy on this critical issue. Having grown up in SeaTac myself, I know it is important to fight for our children’s right to a safe and healthy learning environment.   
Defeating Harmful Anti-Environment Policy Riders 
I am pleased that we were able to block most of the harmful Anti-environmental riders that were proposed in this bill. In addition, I am proud that we used this year’s NDAA to highlight the growing threat that climate change has on our national security, country, and the world. 
Below are just a few of the provisions we were able to stop from being included in the bill this year:  
	•	Endangered Species Act: Does not include a provision that would have seriously undermined Endangered Species Act protections for the Greater Sage Grouse, the Lesser Prairie Chicken, and the American Burying Beetle.
	•	Mineral Mining Regulations: Does not include a provision that would have weakened the environmental review and regulatory process for new mines.
	•	Indefinite Land Withdrawals: Does not include the House provision that would have made all military land withdrawals indefinite.
I was also successful in adding new provisions to NDAA related to climate change and energy. These include provisions requiring DOD installations to establish energy and climate resiliency plans, authorizing the use of certain funds to help local communities deal with sea level rise, and requiring plans for an operations energy policy that enhances energy security, resiliency, and conservation. 
I will continue to work each year to ensure that the NDAA is focused on supporting our military service members and enhancing national security, not driving partisan riders that are harmful to our environment. Congress must do more to protect our environment and enact policies to promote clean energy and address climate change.     
Critical Nuclear Safety and Whistleblower Protection Provisions in National Defense Authorization Act 
It is the federal government’s moral and legal obligation to ensure that the communities surrounding Hanford are cared for. The employees working on the clean-up must be respected and kept safe, and our environment must be protected. Our country’s security owe much to the sacrifices made by the Hanford workers  and their communities in support of the nuclear defense programs that created the nuclear waste a currently stored at Hanford. The provisions contained in this year’s NDAA contribute to ensuring that the federal government fulfills its obligation to the Pacific Northwest for the safe remediation of the Hanford nuclear facility. 
I am proud that I successfully fought to ensure that the following provisions were included in the NDAA: 
	•	Increased Budget allocations for Nuclear Clean-up: Authorizes an additional $50 million for Hanford site clean-up at the Central Plateau. 
	•	Pressing for nuclear safety and whistleblower protection: Includes a provision stating that the Secretary of Energy should impose civil penalties on contractors for violations of Department of Energy (DOE) rules, regulations, and orders relating to nuclear safety and radiation protection. It also enhances accountability by requiring notification of whether the Department of Energy has imposed any of these penalties pursuant to its authorities. This provision was in response to a 2016 GAO report that found that the Department of Energy had very infrequently used its enforcement authority to hold contractors accountable for unlawful retaliation.
	•	Improved Transparency: Requires regular briefings to Congress on vapor problems at the Hanford site.
	•	Increased Accountability: Requires prompt congressional notification in the case of air release of radioactive or hazardous contamination at Hanford, and requires congressional briefings on cause, estimated timeline and costs for addressing such contamination.
	•	Recommits to the Hanford Waste Tank Clean-Up Program: Includes Congressman Dan Newhouse’s amendment to extend the Hanford waste tank clean-up program until 2024. 
Passing Yemen Reforms 
There is a terrible humanitarian crisis occurring in Yemen, and it deserves our attention in Washington, D.C. That’s why I successfully fought to include Yemen reform provisions while negotiating the final version of the NDAA. These will be major steps promoting accountability regarding Yemen’s civil war. I am pleased that we are able to make concrete progress on this issue. I strongly urge all sides of this conflict to implement a countrywide cease-fire, and work with the U.N. Special Envoy to negotiate a peaceful resolution to this violence. In Congress, we will keep fighting for transparency and accountability on Yemen. We must be willing to continue to act in the face of this growing crisis.

House Passage of the BUILD Act of 2018  
Passage of the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act, known as the BUILD Act, by the House of Representatives this July, is an important step to modernizing U.S. international development finance and showing that the United States is committed to leading the international community in supporting less developed countries. This new institution will focus on sustainable, broad-based development programs supporting critically needed projects in communities across the world. It strengthens our ability to support economic growth that ensures people have the opportunity to live healthy lives and achieve their fullest potential. 
Make no mistake, this reform is only part of our commitment to providing help to those most in need around the world. We must take an all-in approach to our foreign assistance that includes robust direct assistance from the United States. I will continue to fight for these essential programs promoting health, peace, and stability that are vital to our national security. 
Read more about the BUILD Act in the Washington Global Health Alliance’s recent Field Notes HERE. 
Honoring James Marshall “Jimi” Hendrix 
In July, I introduced legislation designating the post office at 4301 NE 4th Street in Renton, Washington as the James Marshall “Jimi” Hendrix Post Office. The post office is less than one mile from the site of where Hendrix is buried at Greenwood Memorial Park. 
Renaming the Renton Highlands Post Office the ‘Jimi Hendrix Post Office Building’ is one more way we can celebrate the legacy of one of the greatest musicians of our time and the importance of the south Seattle and Renton areas in his enduring legacy. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame calls Hendrix, ‘the most gifted instrumentalist of all time, a self-taught electric guitarist whose fluid, immersive style was perfectly suited to embrace – and then revolutionize – the late 60’s psychedelic rock movement.’ This designation will further honor this iconic artist and his Seattle roots.   
Medicare for All Caucus 
I'm proud to be a founding member of the Congressional Medicare for All Caucus. The American public agrees: we need a Medicare for all health system to guarantee healthcare to every person living in the US. Far too many people don’t have access to affordable healthcare in this country and I look forward to working together with my colleagues on the Medicare for All Caucus to change that.

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 8.6.18
Monday, August 6, 2018 –                                 
Help for Veterans
Although the Veterans Administration was formally organized during the Herbert Hoover presidency, benefits for veterans can trace their roots to near the nation’s birth. Veterans deserve the thanks and support of all Americans for the sacrifices they made on our behalf. Thus, veterans are promised benefits in recognition of their service.
For too many veterans, these promises were hollow. Scandals involving unacceptable wait times for medical appointments revealed in recent years at the Department of Veterans Affairs shocked the country.
Correcting these problems and improving veterans’ care is a priority of the House, and we have made progress. Important reforms to enhance the quality and availability of care have been signed into law.
Earlier this year, I wrote about House passage of the VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks (MISSION) Act, a major step forward. It consolidates several VA programs into a community care program while continuing the VA Choice Program until the consolidation is complete. The Choice Program is a great concept, but the execution has proved difficult in some instances. Medical providers participating in the program have informed me that they face trouble getting payment. In some cases, this may be resistance from parts of the VA, so they opt out altogether. Hopefully, when consolidated, these problems will lessen.
The VA Mission Act also establishes a review process to modernize and realign the VA’s medical infrastructure and improves the VA’s ability to recruit and retain health care professionals.
Since I wrote about it, the Senate passed the VA MISSION Act and President Trump signed it.
The VA MISSION Act is a notable reform, but others have been approved by the House as well. In June, we passed a bill extending benefits to sailors and airmen who served during the Vietnam War era and were exposed to Agent Orange; current law only provides these benefits to those who served on land. I am a cosponsor of this bill, as well as a similar one ensuring benefits for veterans who served at military bases in Thailand during the same period.
During the last week of July, the House passed nine veterans bills. They included reforms to make sure that the VA is hiring highly-qualified personnel, smooth the transition for veterans headed back into civilian life, and assist with education.
A bill that advanced through the Energy and Commerce Committee to improve the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline also included a provision to study its effectiveness for veterans. I cosponsored this legislation and am glad that the House passed it in July, too.
All told, the House has passed over 80 veterans bills during this Congress, and President Trump has signed more than two dozen into law.
We owe our veterans a tremendous debt for their sacrifices. Looking after their well-being, whether helping care for the wounded or promoting education and job opportunities for those returning to civilian life, is the best way to express our gratitude.
If you are a veteran in the Ninth District in need of assistance with the VA, I encourage you to contact my office online at morgangriffith.house.gov, by calling my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405, or by calling my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671.
Volunteerism
The desire to serve something greater than oneself motivates men and women to join the Armed Forces. That desire can also be put to good use in our communities. Volunteering helps improve the places we call home. It is an act of good citizenship, but also a way to strengthen the bonds between neighbors and friends, and a good deed that leaves us feeling better about ourselves.
Unfortunately, interest in volunteering has declined in recent years. When I was in Glade Spring earlier this summer, a first responder asked if I could raise awareness of this issue. The decline is reflected in national studies as well as the comments I hear as I travel the Ninth District. Such a trend deprives a community of the best from its citizens. So, if you are not currently volunteering, consider giving a few hours each month to a worthwhile community organization.
There are many avenues one can choose to get involved, from public functions such as fire departments to educational endeavors such as parent-teacher associations to civic organizations such as Rotary Clubs. If you are not involved, I encourage you to find a volunteer opportunity that matches your talents and the community’s needs.
If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office. You can call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671. To reach my office via email, please visit my website at www.morgangriffith.house.gov.

Dear fellow South Carolinians,  Thank you for subscribing to my weekly e-newsletter, and please remember to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.  
 Passage of the 2019 NDAA Wednesday was a great day for Americans, as Congress officially passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019.  South Carolinians know that our armed forces are the pillars of our country’s national defense. They are exceptional—the finest in the world.  I am proud that not only did Congress authorize funding for our military and pass needed policy improvements, but we did so before the end of the fiscal year—a true testament to the importance of our nation’s armed forces.  Some of the key provisions I supported included South Carolina base improvements, troop readiness and military equipment enhancement, a military pay raise and more. You can read my full statement here. 
 Senate Finance Committee Letter Last week, I helped lead my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee in urging President Trump to name the United States Ambassador to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The letter stated the following:  “Under the Trump economy, the United States has seen unprecedented growth and regained its reputation of being the most competitive nation in the world in which to do business in. With that comes the important task of ensuring that our tax interests abroad are aimed at keeping America first. We have already seen the European Union (EU) take steps to target U.S. companies because they see this administration’s pro-growth policies as a threat to their own economy. I urge the President to name a strong and powerful Ambassador to the OECD to ensure that American interests are represented in the global markets.” You can read the full letter here. 
 Happy Birthday U.S.C.G. I would like to take the time to wish a happy birthday to the United States Coast Guard, who celebrated their 228th year this past Saturday. I am grateful and very proud of the everyday sacrifices of the men and women who serve our nation. Thank you & congratulations on 228 years! ￼ 

Sincerely,
￼ 
Tim

Pete’s Top Tweets RepPeteOlson  Great to attend the ribbon cutting for Innovision Family Eyecare in Cinco Ranch with @KatyChamber today! ￼   RepPeteOlson  Our economy is stronger than ever thanks to the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct – 4.1% GDP, record job growth & 4% unemployment. We are #BetterOffNow. See what the NYT is saying about it. https://nyti.ms/2KnZhUF   ￼   RepPeteOlson  The @taxfoundation projects that 121,671 new jobs will be created in Texas by 2025 thanks to #taxreform! That’s larger than the @COPearland population! ￼ 
Dear Friend,  Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to read about some of last week’s highlights here in Texas during our district work period.  Sending Off Katy Military Recruits  Yesterday, I was honored to help send off 58 newly enlisted military recruits from Katy at the Katy VFW Post 9182. It was great to see our community come together to celebrate the patriotism of these brave men and women as they embark on this great journey in defense of America. I wish them the very best and thank them for their service on behalf of a grateful nation. ￼  Rep. Olson and Katy military recruits   NASA Announces Commercial Flight Crew Assignments  On Friday, I attended the NASA Commercial Flight Crew Assignments at Johnson Space Center with NASA Administrator Bridenstine, Senator Cruz and Reps. Babin and Culberson. These nine astronauts will be a part of the first missions for Boeing and Space X and will be the first crews launched on American made spacecraft from American soil since 2011.  ￼  NASA Commercial Crew astronauts with Senator Cruz, Rep. Babin, Administrator Bridenstine. Rep. Culberson and Rep. Olson   Feedback from TX-22 Small Businesses  On a recent tour of Amber’s Designs Fine Jewelry, Amber shared helpful information on how her store operates on a day to day basis. We also discussed how tariffs will impact small businesses and how I can best advocate on behalf of small businesses in Congress. Small businesses make up 98.6% of the retail industry. They employ many of our friends and neighbors, and provide needed products and services to our community. ￼  Rep. Olson and Amber Gustafson tour her store, Amber’s Designs Fine Jewelry   Creech Elementary School Reopens  On Thursday, it was exciting to attend an open house at the newly rebuilt Creech Elementary School. During Hurricane Harvey, Creech was damaged by several feet of water and students were relocated to the University of Houston Cinco Ranch campus. Our Katy community showed the true spirit of Texans and came together to support our students and Creech will reopen for the 2018-2019 school year! Welcome home Comets!  ￼  Creech Elementary School Principal Lucas and Rep. Olson   I'm honored to represent you in Congress.

8/6/18 16:56,News from Nita: $336k grant for White Plains Fire Department 🚒 — “We must not rush into construction” of NY Harbor storm surge barriers,"￼
ABOUT NITA           CONSTITUENT SERVICES           NEWSROOM           LEGISLATIVE ISSUES           17th DISTRICT           CONTACT ME 
Dear Friend: 
I wanted to bring to your attention a couple major actions I took last week on behalf of the Lower Hudson Valley:  
	•	Announcing a $336,430 Federal Grant for White Plains Fire Department 
	•	Calling on the Army Corps of Engineers to Extend Public Comment Period on Storm Surge Barrier Plans for NY Harbor
Announcing a $336,430 Federal Grant for White Plains Fire Department
￼ 
The White Plains Fire Department has been awarded a $336,430 federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) to provide rescue training for personnel in the fire department's Rescue Company.  
	•	New York's first responders put their lives on the line to protect our communities, and we must ensure that they have the training to perform their critical public service while ensuring their own safety.
	•	Not only will this federal funding enhance rescue training in White Plains, it will help our first responders save lives during emergencies. 
	•	As the highest ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, which oversees federal funding allocations, I will continue to secure these vital resources for our emergency personnel. 
Calling on the Army Corps of Engineers to Extend Public Comment Period on Storm Surge Barrier Plans for NY Harbor 
I've called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to extend the public comment period on proposals to construct storm surge barriers in New York Harbor from 30 to 90 days, and to hold additional public meetings throughout the entire Hudson Valley. 
	•	""It is clear to me that a project of this significance must be fully understood by all who would be affected. The opportunity for study and comment has been unnecessarily brief. While I understand that recent storms have prompted a call for urgent action, we must not rush into construction and permanent change to the nature of the river until we have public approval to proceed,"" I wrote in a letter to Lt. Gen. Todd T. Semonite, Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of USACE, and Bryce W. Wisemiller, Project Manager at USACE - New York District.

Dear Lindsey, 
As a mother, a grandmother, and someone who has employed new moms and dads, I know that having a baby is both a time of great joy and often anxiety. Babies change their parents’ lives for the better, but introduce serious new challenges and costs. Congress should support families when they bring new life into the world, and that is why I am introducing legislation to establish a voluntary paid family leave program. The United States is the only industrialized country in the world that does not offer access to paid maternity leave. Without access to paid leave, parents face lower labor force participation and reduced lifetime earnings, despite needing a steady income then more than ever.
 
Research shows that women who have paid leave are more likely to return to work after having a child. Families shouldn’t have to choose between financial stability and the well-being of their children. While it’s clear that we need to support our parents, we don’t need new entitlements. New taxes and mandates will just hurt employers and employees alike. This program will be self-financing and will not grow government. The legislation will expand freedom and flexibility, and make parenthood more affordable. These irreplaceable moments, the relationships and peace of mind of our moms, dads, and children—these are the things worth fighting for. I am extremely proud to be leading on this issue and I look forward to introducing legislation when the House reconvenes in September.

During the August district work period, I am excited to meet with constituents, agencies, and businesses across Missouri’s 2nd District. Last week, I met with the Environment Protection Agency’s (EPA) Superfund Task Force Chair Steven Cook, State Representative Mark Matthiesen, and Just Moms’ Dawn Chapman and Karen Nickel to discuss the proposed cleanup plan for the West Lake Landfill. It is an honor to fight alongside Mark, Dawn, and Karen as we pursue the permanent and safe solution our community deserves. I am glad to hear the EPA is on track to deliver a final Record of Decision by September 30th, and look forward to continuing to work together in the coming months.

All too often, government imposters call, text, or email constituents requesting personal information and threatening overdue payments. My office has received several complaints about these scams, and the Federal Trade Commission has issued a warning with suggestions for how to protect yourself against these fraudulent communications. Never give your personal or financial information to anyone who calls, emails, or texts. If a legitimate government agency is trying to reach you, they will go through postal mail, as well as issue several warnings before you have an “overdue” payment. 
 
My staff is always happy to assist if you need help communicating with a federal agency. If you are having problems getting an answer, or if you feel you have been treated unfairly, my office may be able to help resolve the problem or get you more information. While we cannot guarantee a favorable outcome, we will do our best to help you receive a fair and timely response to your problem. Additionally, with passports, we may be able to help expedite your application in an emergency, report lost passports, and monitor overseas travel restrictions. If you are in need of assistance, call my district office at (636) 779-5449.

Forever GI Bill Expands VA Educational Benefits

‘Medicare for all’ projected to cost $32.6 trillion
￼ ￼ Click here to read more from AP News.
A new study was published last week detailing the costs associated with Senator Bernie Sanders's Medicare for all plan. The ten year cost of this plan would be $32.6 trillion. This plan would nearly double federal spending and would require massive tax increases all while handing all healthcare decisions over to the government. This plan would kick 168 million Americans off their private insurance plans and onto government programs. This plan has the cosponsorship of 123 Democrats in the House and 16 Senators.

Louisburg and Bucyrus Tour
Foote Cattle
￼ Kevin with Bob and Gail Foote and their granddaughters.
I had a busy day with eight stops around Louisburg and Bucyrus, the southern part of the 3rd District. My first stop began by discussing agriculture at Foote Cattle. Ranchers like the Footes are critical to preserving the safety and security of the nation’s food supply. As Chairman of the Congressional Beef Caucus, I’m proud to highlight the importance of the beef industry as the largest segment of the American agriculture economy.
Powell Observatory
￼ Kevin at the Powell Observatory.
Second stop was at the Powell Observatory in Louisburg viewing one of the largest telescopes open to the public in a five state area. Thank you to volunteer extraordinaire David Young for the tour.
Louisburg City Hall
￼ Kevin at Louisburg City Hall.
Third stop was at the Louisburg City Hall to meet staff and see the new Louisburg Chamber of Commerce office along with Mayor Marty Southard and City Manager Nathan Law.
Broadway’s St in Downtown Louisburg 
￼ Kevin on Broadway St. in downtown Louisburg.
Fourth stop was to Broadway's St in downtown Louisburg. After seeing the beginning of construction last year, it was neat to see Broadway’s upgrade and nice new entrance to downtown, which is just in time for the city’s sesquicentennial. 
Louisburg Fire Department 
￼ Kevin with  the Louisburg Fire Department.
Fifth stop of the day was at the Louisburg Fire Department to thank retiring Fire Chief Paul Richards for his service spanning more than three decades. I would also like to thank all of our first responders for their service to the American people. 
Timbercreek Louisburg
￼ Kevin at lunch at Timbercreek Louisburg.
Sixth stop was a lunch at Timbercreek Louisburg with Police Chief Tim Bauer, State Rep. Jene Vickrey and several community leaders from school district to the Chamber.
Olathe Health in Louisburg
￼ Kevin meeting with Olathe Health.
Seventh stop was to Olathe Health in Louisburg to hear from Dr. McGinnis and Phil Schneider, Director of Pharmacy on their experiences and work combatting the opioid epidemic in Kansas. 
 
The House spent the last two weeks of June passing dozens of bills to combat the opioid crisis. The cornerstone legislation of this effort was H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. This bill included measures to improve care for infants born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, improve monitoring of opioid prescriptions in Medicare, and enhance the use of alternative pain treatments. Other bills passed by the House increased resources for law enforcement to protect our communities and stop the flow of illegal opioids. I voted in favor of all of these bills and am proud to be part of the massive effort to end this crisis.
Guetterman Brothers Family Farms
￼ Kevin meeting with Rosie and Nick Guetterman.
Eighth and final stop was more agriculture discussions at Guetterman Brothers Family Farms in Bucyrus with Rosie and Nick Guetterman. It is helpful for me to hear directly from producers in my district about how federal agriculture legislation has impacted their businesses. I support policies that promote a successful agriculture economy and keep affordable food on the tables of American families.

Around the District
Rock Steady Boxing Kansas City at In Your Corner
￼ Kevin at Rock Stead Boxing Kansas City at In  Your Corner.
Last week, I stopped by Rock Steady Boxing Kansas City at In Your Corner to see their workout program to ‘knock back’ the symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease. Parkinson’s is a disorder of the central nervous system that affects movements and normally presents as tremors. By exercising with specific routines to target an individual's balance and movement, those who attend the gym have seen improvements. It was inspiring to watch the hard work each person at the gym put in, and to speak to those whose lives have been changed by the class. One man I spoke with said that before joining the gym, he couldn't tie his shoes. Today, he can.
I have worked hard to increase federal funding for medical research through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to cure diseases like Parkinson's. In 2018, we invested $177 million in research targeted specifically at Parkinson's, an increase of $9 million over the previous year. Overall, I have helped increase NIH funding by $7 billion in the last three years alone. However, we must continue to increase our investments in these efforts, as Parkinson’s affects approximately 1 million people in the U.S. and costs around $20 billion per year - far more than we are currently spending on finding a cure.
Thank you to Sarrisa Curry, owner of Rock Steady Boxing, and all of those at the gym for visiting with me. And special thanks to my friend and advocate, Ron Dover, for the invitation. As a member of the Congressional Caucus on Parkinson’s Disease, I will continue to support legislation and funding for treatments and cures.

Fighting for Affordable, Quality Health Care for North Dakotans
￼
In the U.S. Senate, I've continued to push for health care coverage that's affordable and accessible to more North Dakotans — including for our veterans and their families. Here I am in April 2018 at the opening of the new Sanford Veterans Club. 
A few years ago, Kathryn, a mom from Mandan, had her beautiful daughter, Valerie. Valerie was dangerously premature— under two pounds, struggling for her life, and needed immediate open-heart surgery. Valerie is doing well thanks to the care of doctors and specialists who have been able to make sure she gets the best possible start in life, but she could face a lifetime of health challenges. 
Now, Kathryn is worried about the medical bills that will continue to pile up in the years to come, especially since this administration is moving to allow health insurance companies to once again discriminate against folks with preexisting conditions, just like Valerie has. 
Click here to watch Kathryn tell her story. And listen to the stories of Annelise and Amanda to hear more about what would happen if North Dakotans lose access to affordable health care coverage.  
The U.S. Department of Justice recently announced it will no longer defend in court critical health care protections for seniors, children, and those with preexisting conditions across North Dakota. 
That's just wrong. Under current federal law, health insurers are prohibited from denying coverage or charging more for individuals with pre-existing conditions. But this administration wants to change that — at the expense of hundreds of thousands of North Dakotans. 
Simply put, the administration is turning its back on some of the most at-risk Americans— millions of individuals, children, and seniors. And its action, or lack thereof, could lead to insurance companies charging more or denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions like Valerie, putting her health and her family’s financial security at risk.
Upwards of 130 million Americans under the age of 65 have what health insurance companies consider a ‘preexisting condition’—  ranging from heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s to pregnancy. If you don’t have a pre-existing condition yourself, chances are you know plenty of folks who do—  there are over 300,000 in North Dakota alone. 
￼
Since 2013, I've regularly met with the North Dakota health care leaders and advocates who make up my health care advisory board. Together, we've helped push for commonsense, bipartisan reforms to the health care law that benefit rural health care, North Dakota’s military families, and Indian Country.
Our goal should be to make it easier for Americans to get affordable health care – not harder. That’s why since I joined the U.S. Senate, I’ve been working on to find ways to make the health reform law work better for families and businesses in North Dakota, while also making health care more accessible and affordable. To protect North Dakotans with preexisting conditions, I recently helped introduce a resolution that would allow the Senate Legal Counsel to step in to fill the shoes of the U.S. Justice Department. This action would enable us to fight back and defend affordable health coverage for sick, older, and at-risk North Dakotans, including those with preexisting conditions—  because this administration won’t do that important job anymore. 
It’s one of many common sense actions I’ve taken over the past several years to support affordable, quality health care for North Dakotans and make the health reform law work better for North Dakota families and businesses. 
I’ve also helped lead the effort to successfully delay the Health Insurance Tax to keep costs down for North Dakota families and small businesses, and I’ve worked in good faith with a group of Republicans and Democrats on a package of pragmatic reforms that would stabilize the health insurance market and address rising health care costs.
Soon after I joined the Senate, I created my health care advisory board— comprised of health care leaders across North Dakota. We have met regularly since 2013 to talk about health care in the state and improving the health reform law. 
I hear stories like Valerie’s nearly every day, and I know personally what it’s like to face tough odds. Eighteen years ago, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. Thanks to the blessings of good medical care and a strong support network of family and friends, I beat it. Today, I’m a cancer survivor. But I’m also one of the thousands of North Dakotans with a preexisting condition that would enable an insurance company to charge me more for basic care or deny me coverage altogether if the administration continues down this path.  
With so many North Dakotans— including children – in need of quality health care who now risk losing access to it, I’m continuing to fight for pragmatic solutions to make health care more affordable and accessible to all. That’s just the right thing to do. And it’s something we should all be able to agree on.

Congressman Flores Recaps Summer Town Hall Series

 
Last week, U.S. Representative Bill Flores (R-Texas) hosted two district-wide town hall events to discuss the work being done in Congress, answer constituent questions and to get feedback on various issues.  “As with our previous town hall events, our summer series of town halls was very successful in reaching thousands of constituents from all across the 17th Congressional District. I was encouraged by the participation we had and greatly valued the feedback received. We believe that our town halls are bringing representative government into the 21st century. Looking forward, we will continue to hold more of these events, which are convenient for and preferred by a large majority of our constituents,” Congressman Flores said.   During the events, Congressman Flores was able to reach over 7,500 constituents. Combined, the two events had over 3,400 direct participants on the telephone, while the Facebook and Flores.House.gov/liveforum video feeds reached over 4,100 individuals. The archived video broadcasts of the events can be found at facebook.com/RepBillFlores.  During the events, Congressman Flores posed six questions to constituents to get their opinions on various topics. The questions and combined results are as follows:   1.  Do you think the country is on a better or worse track than it was two years ago? 
	•	Better – 72%
	•	Worse – 28%
 2.  What do you think is the best solution for dealing with children separated from their parents who are caught entering the U.S. illegally?
	•	Separate the children from their parents while their case for illegal entry is being tried – 2%
	•	Detain the children with the parents while their case for illegal entry is being tried – 21%
	•	Drop the charges of illegal entry and let the children and parents stay in the U.S.– 5%
	•	Release the children and parents to stay in the U.S. and expect them to appear for a future court date – 12%
	•	Immediately send the children and their parents back to their country of origin – 60%
 3.  How would you rate the status of our nation’s economy on a scale of 1-5?
	•	1 - Very Good Shape – 20%
	•	2 - Good Shape – 43%
	•	3 - Fair Shape – 27%
	•	4 - Poor Shape – 8%

	•	Climate Change – 15%
	•	Reducing Federal Deficits – 11%
	•	Reform the Biggest Drivers of Our Deficits – Social Security, Medicare, & Medicaid – 13%

Voice Your Comments on the Census Today!
The deadline to submit a comment is tomorrow, August 7th.

Dear Friend:

The Constitutionally-mandated Decennial Census is one of the most consequential responsibilities of the federal government. Every decade, the Census enumeration is carefully considered by leaders in both the private sector and federal, state, and local government bodies. The Decennial Census is the backbone to providing fair and full representation in our government and further informs funding and resources provided to congressional districts across the country.

￼

As the 2020 Census approaches, it is important for Americans to voice their opinions about the information collected in the Census and how it is collected. Submitting these comments plays a vital role in the final Census operations, and I encourage you to take this opportunity to share your voice by submitting a comment.

Submit your comment here.

I hope you will take this opportunity to participate in our government and help our nation. 

Sincerely, 
￼
Adriano Espaillat
Member of Congress
Proudly serving New York's 13th congressional district

8/6/18 15:06,Working For You Update: Stopping 3D Printed Guns,"News from Congressman Brad Schneider 
￼

￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ 
￼
￼
￼
￼

Dear Friends, 
I’ve heard from many constituents concerned about the potential release of online blueprints that would allow individuals to use a 3D-printer to manufacture a firearm. While a court order has temporarily delayed the release, legislation is needed to ensure the threat of 3D printed guns does not become a reality for our communities. Last week, I partnered with three of my colleagues to introduce new legislation that would keep these plans off the internet. 
Additionally, I introduced a bill to prevent former Members of Congress who lobby from abusing the privileges of their previous public service on behalf of corporate clients. Learn more about both of these bills below. 
Finally, we’re continuing a jam-packed August of events across the district with a Wednesday Job Fair in Round Lake and Saturday Health Care Fair in Waukegan. You can access the full calendar of upcoming events at schneider.house.gov/events. I hope to see you around this summer! 
STOPPING 3-D PRINTED GUNS 
￼ 
If detailed instructions for homemade plastic guns are readily available on the internet, with just a few clicks individuals could avoid a background check and build a deadly firearm undetectable by security systems. These 3D-printed guns are not toys but real weapons that pose a threat to the safety of our nation and communities.  Congress must not wait for this threat to lead to tragedy, which is why, with three like-minded colleagues, I introduced a bill to keep these blueprints from being posted online. Our bill is the House companion to legislation introduced in the Senate by Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL). 
I’ve previously introduced legislation to crack down on untraceable “Ghost Guns” bought and shipped as unassembled kits, and will continue to work to close loopholes allowing individuals to evade our nation’s background check system. 
Learn more about the 3D Printed Gun Safety Act 
  
PROMOTING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN CONGRESS 
￼  
Serving in Congress is a high honor and great responsibility.  In recognition of that service, former Members retain access to the Capitol and other selected spaces after they leave Congress. I believe those fortunate enough to have earned the right to represent our neighbors should not be able to use this access for personal gain upon retirement.  Put simply, it’s wrong for former Members of Congress to leverage their public service for personal profit lobbying on behalf of private clients or large corporations.This is why I introduced the Preventing Perks and Privileges Act which would shut down these abuses, as well as institute other commonsense good government reforms. Ultimately, when Congress is more accountable and transparent, we more effectively serve our constituents. 
Specifically, my bill would: 
	•	Prohibit former Members of Congress who become lobbyists from receiving certain health and pension benefits, from access to the floor in either chamber, access to Member dining rooms, access to House and Senate document rooms, and use of the House Legislative Resource Center and Senate Library;
	•	Require Members’ annual financial disclosure statements to be posted on their websites;
	•	Prohibit the use of taxpayer funds to pay for spouses that accompany Members on official travel; and
	•	Prohibit Members from using airline miles accrued as a result of their service for personal use. Instead, the bill would require these miles to either be used for official travel or donated.
 Learn more about the Prohibiting Perks and Privileges Act on my website.

Nolan Amendment to Fully Account for U.S. Troops Deployed Around the World Heads for President's Desk 
￼  According to the Pentagon, some 200,000 U.S. troops are stationed among 177 countries around the world. My amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act requires that Congress and the public be informed of these deployments except when national security requires otherwise.  
Dear Friend,  
The Pentagon will be required to fully and publicly account for the whereabouts of the more than 200,000 U.S. troops deployed in 177 countries around the world under my amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) – a measure now headed for the President’s desk after being passed by both houses of Congress. 
By way of background, after four American soldiers were ambushed and tragically killed in the African country of Niger last October, it became evident that Congress was largely uninformed of the fact that some 800 U.S. special forces had been sent there on an anti-terrorist mission. 
As I have pointed out many times before, the Constitution assigns Congress – not the President – the sole authority to decide whether to authorize the use of military force. In order to fulfill that duty, Congress needs a far better understanding of the purpose, mission, and rules of engagement for the men and women who protect our Nation’s interests around the word.
Specifically, my amendment does three things 
	1.	On a quarterly basis, requires the Secretary of Defense to report via publicly available website the number of service member deployments to each country during that four month period.  
	2.	Requires the Secretary to report the TOTAL number of troops deployed to each country – not just the number being moved in and out during the quarter.  
	3.	Allows the Secretary to use a waiver in cases where reporting troop deployments would put national security at risk. However, the Secretary must report to Congress the reasons for the waiver and where the waiver is being used. Moreover, each use of a waiver must be publicly reported on the website.
In short, when our best and brightest young people are put in harm’s way around the world, Congress and the American people need to know about it unless urgent national security concerns dictate otherwise. That’s what this amendment is all about. 
We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email. 
Sincerely,  ￼ 

Finishing a Long Journey, We Finally Dedicate the New Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig School on the Leech Lake Reservation 
￼  The entire Leech Lake community was invited to come and join in the celebration and dedication of the brand new Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig school last week.  
Persistence pays off. After years of hard work by Minnesotans in Congress to obtain the necessary federal funding, we dedicated the new Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig school on the Leech Lake Indian Reservation last week. And children in Minnesota’s Indian Country received the powerful message that their education and success are vitally important to our Nation.   This beautiful, modern new facility replaces the cold, dangerous, dilapidated, bat and rat infested pole barn that was never intended to serve as a school in the first place. Securing support for the project was a major bipartisan win for Minnesota and our region – a testament to what can be accomplished when Democrats and Republicans work together.   
￼  Back in 2015, then Minnesota Republican Congressman John Kline, who was serving as Chairman of the House Education Committee, joined me on a tour of the dilapidated and dangerous Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig school. Here we are touring one of the classrooms. Along with Minnesota Congresswoman Betty McCollum and Senators Amy Klobuchar and now former Senator Al Franken, we worked hard to obtain some $12 million in federal funds to replace the structure with the beautiful new facility we dedicated last week. (Photo courtesy of the Bemidji Pioneer).  
In my remarks, I likened our long and difficult campaign for the new school to the remarkable journey Chief Buffalo of La Point and Chief Flat Mouth of the Leech Lake Band took to Washington, DC in 1852. The purpose of the trip, launched across the Great Lakes in birch bark canoes, was to begin negotiations with President Millard Fillmore on the Treaty of 1854 to stop the removal of the Lake Superior Chippewa from their homes and end starvation that was decimating the Band.   Chief Buffalo was no spring chicken. He was reported to be between 92 and 94 years old at the time. His sacrifice on behalf of the Treaty is still symbolic of the hard work and dedication it often takes today to get things done and achieve the common good.  
￼  Members of the Leech Lake Band and folks from all over the region turned out to celebrate the dedication of the new Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig school last week.  
Make no mistake – for Indian children across America, the journey and the struggle for a good education continues. Sixty-three of the 183 Bureau of Indian Education schools are still in terrible condition. That’s why Democrats and Republicans alike – including former Republican Education Committee Chairman John Kline of Minnesota – supported my successful amendment to the 2015 Education Bill that put Congress on record that the policy of the United States is to ensure that every Indian child attends a school that provides all of the resources and support they need to succeed in their journey through life. 

The International Falls Journal Agrees: ""Go to Washington - Go to Work!""
“We first reported in 2012 Nolan's concerns about the time members of Congress are fundraising versus the time they spend actually doing the work of the people who elected them.” 
(International Falls Journal) 
￼  Wisconsin Republican Congressman Mike Gallagher and I discuss our “Go to Washington-Go to Work” legislation on our way from the U.S. Capitol Building back to our offices.  
International Falls Journal editor Laurel Beager penned this editorial last week in support of “Go to Washington – Go to Work,” the bill Wisconsin Republican Congressman Mike Gallagher and I have introduced to prohibit Members of Congress and their election opponents from personally raising money while Congress is in session. It’s well worth the read. And yes, we are working hard to build support for this common sense, bipartisan measure to get Congress back to work on the people’s business – not dialing for dollars to fund their reelection campaigns. Here's the editorial:  
￼ 
A bipartisan measure introduced in the United States House would prohibit members of and candidates for Congress from any kind of fundraising while Congress is in session. 
Called the ""Go to Washington, Go to Work Act of 2018,"" the measure was introduced by U.S. Reps. Rick Nolan, D-Minn., and Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., and the idea isn't new to residents of the 8th Congressional District. 
We first reported in 2012 Nolan's concerns about the time members of Congress are fundraising versus the time they spend actually doing the work of the people who elected them. 
At that time Nolan believed requiring members of Congress to work five days a week — like most Americans do — would encourage cooperation and agreement. But instead, he said many members spend more time obtaining campaign money to get reelected to another term than they do governing. We said it then, and we'll say it again: We like that kind of thinking by an elected official. And we urge members of the U.S. House to support the act.  
Nolan's been talking about these concerns since 2012 when he sought his position, and then introduced in 2013 the Restore Democracy Act that he said would change the way the nation does politics. That act would have eliminated: Corporate, outside money from coming into the political arena; fundraising while Congress is in session; and stipulated a requirement for “regular order,” which requires the committee process to allow any member to offer an amendment. 
This latest measure would control the cost of congressional campaigns, and that's something Nolan knows about. The spending in the last couple 8th District campaigns have been among the highest in the nation. He and Gallagher note the average cost of a congressional campaign - House and Senate spending averages combined - has increased to more than $10 million, with more and more races doubling that amount. 
We agree the high cost of campaigns is discouraging good candidates from throwing their hats into the ring, and has turned members of Congress into ""telemarketers dialing for dollars."" He said this focus on reelection and fundraising has made this Congress ""the most unaccomplished, undemocratic and unremarkable in our country's history."" 
We agree it's time to change the way we do politics and a big step toward that is reminding our representatives that they were sent to Washington to do our business, before doing theirs. 

The World Focuses on a Cure for  Lung Cancer
￼  Here I am with my youngest daughter Katherine Bensen, a three and a half-year lung cancer survivor (pictured left) and Patti Maguire (pictured right) from the American Cancer Society. 
August 1st marked World Lung Cancer Day as a part of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) effort to raise awareness about this deadly disease worldwide. Leaders, advocates, caretakers, and survivors around the world are taking it one step further by working together to raise awareness every day until we find a cure.  The hard cold fact is, lung cancer continues to be the most deadly cancer worldwide, claiming more lives yearly than breast, colon and prostate cancers combined. Congress needs to dedicate more resources to research preventative methods, treatments, and ultimately a cure for lung cancer and all cancers.  Earlier this year, the U.S. House of Representatives passed my bipartisan amendment to the Defense Appropriations Bill increasing support for the Defense Department’s lung cancer research program from $14 million to $20 million dollars for 2019. I am also proud to have received the Congressional Impact Award from the American Cancer Society Relay For Life and the Congressional Leader in Cancer Prevention Award from the Prevent Cancer Foundation. 
The bipartisan support we are generating for lung cancer research here in Congress is due, in part, to the work of our new Congressional Lung Cancer Caucus. I’m honored to co-chair this growing group along with Republican Congressman Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey. 

Our Week in Duluth
￼  Superior Street in downtown Duluth is one of the city’s oldest streets - the main route throughout the city - and now it's being reconstructed. Members of the City of Duluth, the Greater Downtown Council, Northland Constructors, and Duluth Energy Systems gather weekly to give updates on the project. Nolan Congressional field representative Hannah Alstead attended this week’s meeting and received an update. 
Our Week in North Branch 
￼  North Branch Librarian Sue Monroe retired after serving her community for several years as the North Branch Librarian. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen snapped this photo of Sue at her retirement party. We wish Sue the very best!
Our Week in Center City  
￼    A ribbon cutting for the new Chisago County Public Safety Building was held last week. County Commissioners, State Legislators, Sheriff Thyen, County Attorney Reiter, and others participated. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen attended the ribbon cutting and toured the new state-of-the-art facility. 
Our Week in Mora 
￼  The City of Mora had the Vietnam Memorial Wall, a tribute to our Nation’s heroes and the sacrifice they made to serve our country, on display for locals last week. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen visited the memorial in Mora and captured this photo.  
￼  Also on display in Mora was a famous statue called the Silent Battle, which reflects a grieving soldier struggling from the effects of war. The statue's purpose is to help raise awareness about the impact of Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD). The model is of a local military Veteran from Sandstone, Brian Zimmerman.  
Our Week in Clinton Township
￼  The Steelworkers Organization of Active Retirees (SOAR) gathered for their annual meeting. This year the meeting took place in Clinton Township. These retirees advocate and volunteer to help make their union stronger because they understand that a strong union means better wages, benefits, and retirement. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tom Whiteside attended the event on my behalf.

Finally...
Happy Anniversary to the Voting Rights Act  August 6,1965
￼  President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the landmark Voting Rights Act 53 years ago today, on August 6, 1965. That’s Minnesota’s own Vice President Hubert Humphrey on the left behind the President in this picture. Humphrey, along with Republican Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois (second from the right),  played major roles in passing this law, which sought to eliminate efforts by segregationists to prevent blacks from voting, especially in the South. The measure proved highly successful. In Mississippi alone, voter turnout among black citizens increased from six percent in 1964 to 54 percent by 1969. My Restore Democracy legislation builds on the Voting Rights Act to further attack efforts to suppress Americans from exercising their right to vote.

Friends,  
With all the issues facing our country, it is unfortunate that Congress will be out of session for the next several weeks. However, I will be spending my time in Connecticut meeting with constituents and hearing their concerns about the issues affecting our community. Here’s a little about what I’ve been doing. 
Community Conversation on Race Relations  What I value most about the Fourth District is the rich diversity of our communities. Every culture, ethnicity, and ideology can be found in our country—a melting pot of citizens contributing to a common community. Nevertheless, our nation is experiencing an increase in incidents of racism, discrimination and acts of intimidation towards various groups. These incidents are antithetical to American values, and last week I organized a conversation with prominent community leaders - and many of you - to discuss the most effective ways to counter racial intolerance and bigotry. There are fundamental misunderstandings in the way this conversation is happening, and solutions can only be realized through sustained and open dialogue. We must rededicate ourselves to a much-needed discussion about race relations in our community, and in the United States as a whole.  

￼
Chatting with local experts about ways to elevate our discussion on race relations.
Medal Ceremony for Joseph Hatrick Born on April 29, 1932, Joseph Hatrick has served as an Alderman for the City of Bridgeport, as a Justice of Peace, and in the Army from 1951-1953 in the Korean War as a member of the 5th Regiment Combat Team. Recently, I had the pleasure of awarding him the Korean Ambassador for Peace Medal. The medal is an expression of appreciation from the South Korean government to American servicemen and women for their bravery and sacrifices in the Korean War. It is vital that we continue to recognize and remember the men and women who have so bravely served our nation, and it was an honor to hear from Mr. Hatrick about his experience. If you are a veteran or know of a veteran who is requesting medals that he or she should have received and need assistance, please feel free to contact my office at (203) 333-6600.
￼
Presenting the Korean Ambassador for Peace Medal to Joseph Hatrick.
In the coming recess weeks, I look forward to meeting with my constituents and hearing from you about the issues that impact you. If you would like to schedule a meeting or make me aware of an upcoming event in the Fourth Congressional District, please visit my website here. If it is possible for me to attend, one of my staff members will follow up regarding my availability.  
Sincerely, Jim

Dear Friend, 
  
Due to your interest in childhood education, I wanted to update you on important security measures I have been working on to keep our schools safe.  
  
I agree with the vast majority of Americans that changes must be made in order to protect innocent people from homicidal attackers, especially children in schools.  This is why my staff and I have been engaged with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the United States Secret Service in order to create a comprehensive targeted violence prevention plan. 
  
It is more important than ever to develop risk management options and provide communities with a framework to identify intervention strategies for students who have been deemed a risk for engaging in violence.   
 
My deepest prayers and sympathies continue to be with the victims of the terrorist attacks and mass murders that have struck our country in recent months and years. As we continue to pray, heal, give support, and seek answers, we must also strengthen our resolve and commitment to stamping out every ideology that spreads hate and murder.  I look forward to partnering with our schools and the Department of Homeland Security to enhance school safety for our children.

REP. JEFFRIES PASSES BIPARTISAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM LEGISLATION
 
 
￼

 
 WATCH
On May 22, 2018, the House of Representatives passed the FIRST STEP Act, a substantial prison reform bill. The bill was sponsored by Representative Jeffries and Representative Doug Collins (R-GA). It garnered the support of both the National Urban League and the Koch brothers. The FIRST STEP Act authorizes $250 million over the next five years to develop and execute new programs in education, vocational training and mental health counseling, thereby positioning formerly-incarcerated individuals for a successful reintegration into society. The bill earned bipartisan support and easily passed the House by a landslide margin of 360-59. It is now pending before the Senate. 
 
 
 
 
REP. JEFFRIES SPENDS FATHER’S DAY AT DETENTION CENTER WITH SEPARATED FAMILIES 
 
 
￼


 
WATCH
 
Rep. Jeffries spent Father’s Day at an ICE Detention Center in Elizabeth, N.J., listening to dads separated from their children as a result of the President’s immigration policy. Along with several other Democratic lawmakers, the Congressman visited the facility, where, after being delayed for an hour and a half, he was able to meet with several of the parents in custody. After hearing their stories of fleeing danger in their home countries only to be detained and separated from their children upon reaching the United States, Congressman Jeffries demanded an immediate end to the detention policy he views as immoral, ineffective and indefensible. 
 
                                     
 
 
 REP. JEFFRIES SLAMS COVER-UP CAUCUS FOR ATTACKING FBI AGENT TO DISTRACT FROM THE PRESIDENT’S RUSSIA TIES 
 
 

￼

 
WATCH 
Republicans recently held a hearing on former FBI Agent and Army officer Peter Strzok, where Rep. Jeffries spoke in widely-televised remarks. In his comments, the Congressman chastised them for holding a phony hearing and condemned the use of a hearing to distract from the real and ongoing criminal investigation into collusion between the Trump Campaign and Russia. The Strzok investigation “is not even meritorious of an investigation by Ace Ventura, pet detective,” said Congressman Jeffries, “let alone 75 members of the United States Congress.”  
 
 
 
 REP. JEFFRIES DEMANDS ACTION ON  GUN SAFETY
 
 
￼


 
WATCH
 
In a speech on the House floor, Rep. Jeffries recently addressed the issue of gun violence in America. “Enough is enough,” he said in his remarks, calling for immediate gun violence prevention legislation, and blasting conservatives for their continued refusal to take action and save lives. The overwhelming number of Americans support common-sense measures such as universal background checks. Yet, as the Congressman outlined in his speech, ongoing obstruction on gun safety measures clearly indicates that the majority in the House continues to function as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the National Rifle Association. “We don’t work for the NRA,” said Congressman Jeffries. “We don’t work for the gun manufacturers. We don’t work for the merchants of death. We work for the American people and it’s time for us to finally address the gun violence epidemic in America.”
 


 
REP. JEFFRIES ADVOCATES FOR $70 BILLION IN NYCHA AND PUBLIC HOUSING UPGRADES
 
 
￼
  
 
WATCH
 
In the immediate aftermath of stunning revelations of children exposed to lead poisoning and safety concerns in NYCHA, Congressman Jeffries led five members of Congress in support of $70 billion in federal funding to implement much-needed safety, repair and livability upgrades in public housing. As a result of problems with mold, heating and lead poisoning, NYCHA currently faces a series of lawsuits and investigations into living conditions at their facilities. With support from both House and Senate Democratic leadership, Rep. Jeffries made clear that any infrastructure plan passed by Congress must include funding for substantial public housing repairs across the nation. 
 
 
 
 
 REP. JEFFRIES TO MTA: BROOKLYN MUST HAVE RELIABLE TRANSIT
 
 
￼
 
 
With the 18-month imminent closure of the L train, which is set to impact more than 225,000 Brooklynites who ride this subway line daily, Rep. Jeffries is pushing the MTA to implement alternative travel options to improve the commute. The L train is a primary travel artery between South Brooklyn and Manhattan and is a key component of New York’s transit infrastructure. Without action from the MTA, many of the Congressman’s constituents will be substantially inconvenienced. He will not allow that to happen.

Congressman Bruce Westerman’s eNewsletter Monday, August 6, 2018
￼
￼
I would like to thank Superintendent Steve Anderson of Lake Hamilton Schools for welcoming Attorney General Jeff Sessions and a host of national, state, and local officials to the district for a timely discussion on school safety. Lake Hamilton has been a leader for a quarter century in protecting students and teachers from violence. Their school safety program is something I think all schools can learn from.
Watch the roundtable…

Preventing Cancer in Firefighters 

 ￼
  ￼
  ￼
  ￼
In emergencies, while the rest of us run from danger, firefighters run toward it. And when they rush into the flames they’re not just putting their lives on the line – even firefighters who come home safely face long-term health risks.  A National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health study confirms that firefighters face an increased risk of cancer because of exposure on the job.  That’s why I worked with my colleagues on the bipartisan Firefighter Cancer Registry Act, which President Trump signed into law last month.   Our bill requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to create and maintain a voluntary registry to collect data on cancer among firefighters. We’ll use that data, along with existing state data, to better assess the ways our first responders are at risk, so we can work to prevent more cancer diagnoses.  We’re also requiring the CDC to develop a strategy to maximize participation in the registry, so we can get accurate, useful data. All the data in the registry will be made public, so other experts can use it in their own research.  Last month, I talked with Mike Taylor, President of the Ohio Association of Professional Firefighters. Mike, like many other Ohio firefighters, has seen too many of his brothers and sisters fall victim to the scourge of cancer.   We need to learn why firefighters are at such high risk, and get researchers the data they need to find answers and solutions.  National firefighter organizations, including the National Volunteer Fire Council, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and the International Association of Fire Fighters, among others, pushed for this legislation.  We know this is just a first step and there’s a lot more work to do to protect our first responders. But this bill will help us make progress.   If you only watch cable news, you wouldn’t think anything bipartisan is getting done in Washington. But this legislation is another example of how there are plenty of issues where we put partisanship aside, and come together to do what’s right for the people who serve this country.

Congresswoman Beatty Receives Prestigious NUL Women of Power Award, Delivers Guild Keynote Power-packed four days for Beatty
Last week, U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) was honored with the Women of Power Award during the 2018 National Urban League (NUL) Conference “Save Our Cities: Powering the Digital Revolution.” The Women of Power Award celebrates women leaders nationwide in public service and social justice, and this year Beatty was recognized for her leadership in enacting legislation and advancing the issues and causes important to all women, children, and families in Congress. Also recognized were ‘Me Too' founder Tarana Burke, Scandal Co-Executive Producer Judy Smith, and President and CEO of the Louisville Urban League Sadiqa Reynolds. Past winners include former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, MSNBC anchor Tamron Hall, professional boxer Laila Ali, and Morehouse College of Medicine President Dr. Valerie Montgomery Rice.
“This award serves as a reminder that our collective power is needed now more than ever because the struggle is not over—and our actions can create a movement to address the many economic and societal disparities that have long ravaged communities across America,” Beatty said during the August 2nd Women of Power Awards Luncheon. “Let’s work together and rise up to expand affordable housing, provide high-quality healthcare, and equally high-quality education no matter one’s zip code, improve workforce development, and create good-paying jobs so that we continue empowering communities and changing lives.”
￼ Congresswoman Beatty challenges the crowd to ‘rise up’ during the 2018 NUL Women of Power Award Luncheon (August 2, 2018).
In addition to receiving the Women of Power Award, Beatty was selected to deliver the keynote address for the National Council of Urban League Guilds’ Leadership Luncheon. Coinciding with the NUL Conference, the Luncheon is a marquee event that brought together more than 1,000 members of the National Council of Urban League Guilds to commit to continuing their mission to stimulate, develop, and promote volunteer participation, leadership, and to further the NUL’s important work.
Focusing her remarks on the importance of leadership, Beatty said, “In this room, we have many accomplished individuals and leaders from all walks of life—the private sector, government, nonprofits, the media. Yes, we stand at a magnificent moment, and if we take the rights steps today, we will lay the groundwork tomorrow.” Beatty continued, “That is why you are at this Conference because we need your help to make tomorrow today.”
￼ Congresswoman Beatty reflects on her personal journey and urges Guild members to continue working with courage and confidence. (August 3, 2018).

￼
 Expanding Protections for Victims of Domestic Violence
￼
Rep. Nadler speaking in support of the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization to protect victims of domestic violence and assault.
Last month, I led over 100 of my Democratic colleagues in introducing the reauthorization for the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) which has helped an incalculable number of women, men, and children recover from crimes of violence. Congress must do all it can to ensure VAWA works for every woman, man, or child who may need its protections and that fewer families and individuals experience the trauma of domestic violence and assault. 
To read more about my VAWA reauthorization legislation, please click here.
 Demanding Separated Families Be Reunified
 
￼
Rep. Nadler at a press conference with NYC lawmakers discussing the need to reunite separated families immediately.
The Administration did not reunify approximately 700 children who had been separated from their families by the court-mandated deadline of July 26th. I believe that the failure to meet this deadline makes it clear that there was no plan to ever reunite these children with their parents. The Administration, in my opinion, must be held accountable for their actions, or in this case, inaction. My legislation, the Keep Families Together Act, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from separating children from their parents and restricts the prosecution of parents who are asylum seekers so that we never repeat this tragic mistake. Congress must not rest until every child is safely back with his or her parents, and this sorry chapter in American history is finally closed.
Reflecting on the First Half of 2018
With the August recess upon us, Members of Congress are able to spend more time home in their districts, meeting with constituents and hearing about what issues are important to them. It is also an opportunity to reflect upon the work that has been going on in Washington and how we, as Members of Congress, can do our jobs of representing our constituents better. 

This has been an intense and extremely busy seven months, with a number of major issues receiving national attention. I heard from hundreds of New Yorkers who expressed some of the overwhelming public outrage over the lack of progress on addressing the epidemic of gun violence in the wake of the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Following this, I led my Democratic colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee in calling for an emergency hearing on this vitally important issue and in supporting the Assault Weapons Ban. 

I introduced the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act this past April to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. In my view, the latest indictment of twelve Russian military intelligence officers, as well as the Helsinki Summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, prove the need to protect this investigation. I believe that any steps to interfere with the Special Counsel’s investigation, including removing the Deputy Attorney General or threatening to undermine Special Counsel Mueller, will have to be seen as a direct attempt to aid in the attack on our democracy. We must ensure justice is protected from such threats, and I hope more of my colleagues will join the 126 Members who already support this bipartisan legislation. 

In May, I joined the New York City Economic Development Corporation as the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal (SBMT) was reactivated as a major shipping hub. Over the next several years, these docks will eliminate thousands of semi-truck trips, reducing pollution, noise, and traffic. The opening of this terminal is an absolutely essential part of moving goods more efficiently, growing sustainable and local jobs, protecting our environment, and ensuring our port district retains its position of dominance on the eastern seaboard of the United States. 

This past Father’s Day, I led a surprise visit to a detention center in Elizabeth, New Jersey with six of my Congressional colleagues and spoke with five fathers whose children had been separated from them at the border. These families fled unspeakable violence, coming to this country in search of refuge and protection, only to be welcomed by the Administration’s zero tolerance policy. 

Last month, President Trump nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by Justice Kennedy’s retirement. In my view, this nomination would fundamentally shift the balance of our highest court, drastically moving it to the right. I believe his addition to an already conservative-leaving Court will likely cement extreme legal ideology in this country for the next quarter century, including on issues ranging from reproductive rights, LGBT rights, health and safety, criminal justice, and consumer protections. 

And who can forget the marathon joint Judiciary and Oversight Committee hearing with FBI agent Peter Strzok. The hearing exposed what I believe to be the Majority's desperate efforts to undermine the Special Counsel’s investigation in order to defend the president at any cost. In my view, the Judiciary Committee should be focused on real emergencies, such as election security, voting rights, the family separation crisis, the status of Dreamers, and the president’s potential violations of the Emoluments Clause.

These pressing issues facing our nation will likely continue when Members return to Washington, D.C. in September, and I am committed to doing all I can to hold the Administration accountable. I look forward to hearing from you during this recess period.

Dear Lindsey,
  
Access to health care is a right, not a privilege.  Despite being one of the wealthiest nations in the world, the U.S. lags behind other industrialized countries on a variety of health care metrics, including mortality rates and the high cost of prescription drugs.  As a Member of Congress, I believe we must continue to work towards the goal of achieving universal coverage and improving health care outcomes. 
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law in 2010 to ensure that every American has the opportunity to receive affordable health care coverage.  While the law is far from perfect, we have made extraordinary progress over the past eight years.  Now is the time to build on that progress, not turn our backs on millions of Americans who have obtained health insurance.  For the first time ever, Americans cannot be arbitrarily denied coverage due to pre-existing conditions, and the rate of growth for health care costs remains at historic lows.  Because of the ACA, 20 million Americans have gained insurance coverage, including over 550,000 people right here in North Carolina.  
At the start of the Trump administration, the ACA was working as intended.  Unfortunately, after several failed attempts to repeal and replace the law, the White House and congressional Republican leadership decided to undermine the law’s protections through, what I believe to be, more insidious means.  These actions include cutting funding for community groups that help people sign up for insurance, restricting access to the healthcare.gov website during the open enrollment period, and prohibiting administration officials from participating in enrollment events.  In addition, President Trump has terminated cost-sharing reductions and considered ending risk adjustment payments to insurers, both of which are designed to stabilize the exchanges.  I believe these actions could lead to higher premiums for families across the country.  
Meanwhile, the House Republican leadership passed a tax package that essentially eliminates the individual mandate—a key component of the ACA. They are continuing efforts to repeal other provisions that make the ACA work.  Attorney General Sessions has refused to defend the ACA in court. It is egregious that the White House is now on record seeking to overturn the protections for Americans with pre-existing health conditions.
Despite these constant attacks, the ACA remains the law of the land—for now.  As your representative, I will continue fighting to preserve the ACA’s vital benefits and protections as well as other health programs like Medicare and Medicaid that so many North Carolinian rely upon for care.

	•	Fighting for Health Care

Immigration Update
As you know, standing up for immigrants and refugees continues to be a key priority.  
Earlier this summer, I contacted my colleagues with jurisdiction over immigration policy to share my concerns about immigration enforcement, detention, and court proceedings in Metro Atlanta – one of the worst places in America to be undocumented.  
Like many of you, I was also outraged by the shameful separation of families legally seeking asylum in the United States.  The administration’s so-called “zero tolerance” policy was the latest step in its ongoing assault on immigrant families and communities, and I joined my colleagues on the House Floor to denounce it.  Sadly, this administration-made crisis continues, and too many children are waiting to be reunified with their parents.  I will not stop working to right this wrong caused by this administration’s callousness. 
Unfortunately, the Republican Congress failed to advance bipartisan solutions to challenges facing DREAMers, people who were brought here as children.  For most DREAMers, this is the only country they have ever known.  I continue to believe the best path forward is for Congress to consider and pass H.R. 3440, the DREAM Act.    
In some states – including Georgia – even though DREAMers pay taxes and attend public schools, DREAMers cannot attend certain state universities or are forced to pay out-of-state tuition at public colleges and universities.  Recently, I introduced H.R. 6525, the Higher Education Dream Act, which would prohibit discrimination against DREAMers in higher education.  My bill would remedy this unjust situation.  

Make Your Voice Heard: The 2020 Census
There are a number of attacks on the core democratic values and principles in our nation.  Earlier this year, the Department of Commerce announced that the 2020 Census would include an immigration question.  The U.S. Census is critical to ensuring that our democracy is truly representative, but it is always a challenge to encourage minority and marginalized communities to participate.  
The inclusion of a citizenship question will result in fewer responses, particularly among minority, immigrant, and low-income communities, and will jeopardize the quality data that guide federal funding.  Communities in Metro Atlanta, Georgia, and across the country stand to lose significant representation and resources if this question is included. 
Although the United States Census has not included an immigration question since 1950 – 15 years before the Voting Rights Act – the administration argues that immigration information is necessary to enforce what remains of this sacred statute.   
Today – the 53rd anniversary of the Voting Rights Act – I will file public comments against the proposal to include an immigration question in the 2020 Census.  All members of the public may also express their concerns directly to the Department of Commerce; the deadline is tomorrow, Tuesday, August 7, 2018. 
￼ 

Protecting Democracy
I went to the House Floor recently to discuss the state of American democracy.  In times like these, Congress must exercise its authority under Article I of the U.S. Constitution to stand up for our democracy, for human rights, and for the freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights.   
I am also fighting to protect the voting rights of every American.  I am proud to sponsor H.R. 12, the Voter Empowerment Act (VEA), the most comprehensive voting rights and election administration legislation before the Congress.   
The VEA would increase access to the ballot box, enhance integrity, and ensure accountability in our elections.  It also responds to the 2016 election, where foreign interference, hacking, and shameful efforts to suppress the vote were direct attacks on our democracy that we cannot allow to go unanswered.  
Securing our elections and preserving our democracy should always remain above partisan politics.  

Fighting for Health Care
Last week, we marked the 53rd anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid.  These programs, along with Social Security, are sacred trusts between the United States government and the American people.  
The Republican tax cuts for the rich and wealthy will result in deep cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act – something I warned my colleagues about last fall.  In a recent Ways and Means Committee hearing, I spoke about the failures of the Republican tax cut, and I plan to oppose future tax proposals that will only increase our debt.  I will continue working to strengthen these pillars of our democracy and ensure that they thrive for current and future generations. 
I also introduced H.R. 6601, the Equality in Medicare and Medicaid Treatment (EMMT) Act, which would improve health care access for patients of color, women, high-risk patients, and rural patients.  Medicare is the largest health care payer in the country, and Congress must ensure that its payment models help reduce minority and rural health disparities and not create barriers to care.   
Americans must be able to count on their government to provide them with the basic services they need to survive. 

Congressional Art Competition
In May, I hosted families, teachers, and other members of our community at the High Museum of Art in Midtown for the annual Congressional Art Competition.  Together, we honored talented high school students and enjoyed their magnificent artwork.  
The winning piece, We are Atlanta, will hang in the U.S. Capitol for the next year alongside the winning pieces from congressional districts across the country. 
You can learn more about the competition by clicking here. 

Additional Legislative Items
	•	Jobs and Justice: In May, the Congressional Black Caucus introduced H.R. 5785, the Jobs and Justice Act, a comprehensive bill to increase upward social mobility for African Americans and help ensure equal protection under the law.  H.R. 5785 includes six bills that I authored.  My colleagues and I look forward to keep working to enact meaningful policies to improve the lives of communities of color throughout our nation.
	•	Fighting Hunger:  I strongly opposed House Republicans’ efforts to weaken the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in H.R. 2, commonly called the “Farm Bill.”  This legislation breaks the sacred pact to care for those of all ages and backgrounds who cannot afford to put food on the table. 
	•	Standing for Peace: Earlier this year, I spoke out against the administration’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the multinational agreement to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.
	•	Preserving our Civil Liberties: I led my congressional colleagues in expressing our strong concerns about the risks and dangers of law enforcement officials using facial recognition technology.
	•	LGBTQ Rights:  Like many of you, I was disappointed by the Supreme Court’s decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, a step back for LGBTQ equality.
	•	In Memoriam: This week, I mourned the passing of my friend and colleague, former California Rep. Ron Dellums, who was a staunch advocate for peace as the former chair of the House Armed Services Committee and a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus.

Wicker Calls for Flood Insurance Reforms
Better Assessment of Losses, Updated Maps Are Critical to Program’s Long-Term Success
Congress has passed a short-term extension of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), giving lawmakers more time to reach a consensus on needed reforms.  Although the extension through November is not ideal, a lapse in the program would have been completely reckless, leaving millions of Americans uncertain about their flood insurance protections.
NFIP Marks 50th Anniversary
A flood insurance policy is crucial for Americans in coastal or low-lying areas.  As we saw with last year’s devastating hurricane season, major storms can swiftly bring rains and flooding not seen in hundreds of years.  With six major hurricanes, last year’s season was the most expensive in our nation’s history, exceeding $200 billion in damages.
For many Americans in flood-prone areas, flood insurance can be purchased only through NFIP.  In fact, the lack of flood insurance policies in the private market was the reason why the federal program was first created.  In 1965, Gulf Coast communities were reeling from the extensive harm done by Hurricane Betsy, and homeowners did not have insurance policies to alleviate those losses.  By 1968, Congress had officially created NFIP, and the program has helped protect Americans ever since.  More than 20,000 communities along our nation’s coastlines, rivers, and inland waterways participate, including 329 communities in Mississippi.
NFIP Communities Are Economic Powerhouses
NFIP’s participating communities and their residents are major benefactors to our nation’s economic prosperity.  According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), our coastal counties are home to 56 million jobs and generate $8 trillion in goods and services.  Another economic engine, the Mississippi River, produces $400 billion in revenues.  Cultivating a more suitable NFIP over the long-term would ensure that these communities can continue to thrive without being ruined by the next disaster.  
Reforms to Provide Better Storm Information, Accurate Maps
The past 41 reauthorizations of NFIP have rarely included reforms, making the task over the next few months a challenging one.  But too much is at stake not to seize this opportunity.  Reforming the program is key to keeping it solvent and improving its service to the public. 
I have introduced two legislative proposals to help make NFIP work better.  The first would seek to improve the accuracy of property loss assessments after severe storms like Hurricane Katrina.  After Katrina, homeowners were often caught in the middle of disagreements over whether the damage to their property was caused by wind or water.  My “COASTAL Implementation Act” would improve NOAA’s ability to understand the dynamics of a storm, helping to pinpoint the strength of wind and water at affected sites and reducing NFIP’s costs. 
My second proposal deals with gathering better data, specifically when it comes to the creation of comprehensive and accurate flood maps.  These maps are essential to NFIP, which uses them to identify areas with the greatest flood hazards.  I call this bill the “MEMA Act,” which is short for “Municipality Empowerment Mapping Achievement.”  It would update NFIP’s rate maps for the entire United States and make them more accessible to the public. 
Try as we might, we cannot prevent floods.  We can work to guard against them, but we cannot eliminate them.  They are the most frequent natural disaster, and we should do what we can to mitigate the costs and damage.  Ensuring Americans can still rely on NFIP for disaster protection is key to this preparation.

Dear Friend, 
These past few weeks have been busy, both in Washington and in the First Congressional District.  Last month, I kicked off my 2018 Jobs & Justice Tour and announced an update to my Jobs & Justice Agenda. My Jobs & Justice Tour includes visits to all 14 counties in the First District. 
The people I have talked to while traveling throughout the First District- from Durham, to Williamston, to Roanoke Rapids- all have something in common: they want a better life for their families and loved ones.
That is why I am doing my best to tackle issues such as health care costs, poverty and nutrition, access to affordable education and job training, improvements to public safety, and a fair and equitable system of justice. 
In the coming weeks, I will be hosting the following events throughout the First District- with more events to be announced soon.  
Please forward this email to someone who may be interested in joining us. 
Thank you,

Our Veterans Deserve Answers
￼ 
It is imperative that our nation’s veterans receive access to the highest quality medical testing and treatment options. That’s why I introduced the Vietnam Veterans Liver Fluke Cancer Study Act, which requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to conduct a study to determine the prevalence of “liver flukes,” parasites endemic in the rivers of Vietnam, among the veteran population and the link between a veteran’s service record and affliction. This would pave the way for veterans to claim a service connected disability under their Veterans Affairs benefits. 
The Vietnam Veterans Liver Fluke Cancer Study Act establishes a link between the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure care and coverage for American patriots exposed to the “liver fluke” parasite. With an alarming number of Vietnam veterans carrying ‘Liver Flukes’, this legislation fulfills our nation’s obligation to provide our servicemen and women the health benefits and peace of mind which they are owed.

New Security Tech at Philly Airport
￼ 
I am very pleased that TSA will be deploying additional checkpoint CT scanners at our nation’s airports, especially at the Philadelphia International Airport. This new security screening technology enhances our threat detection capabilities, while streamlining the checkpoint process. CT technology provides enhanced detection of threat items. Like existing CT technology used for checked baggage, the machines create such a clear picture of a bag’s contents that computers can automatically detect explosives, including liquids.  In the future, the goal is to keep laptops and 3-1-1 liquids inside of the bag during checkpoint screening. 
Throughout my time on the Homeland Security Committee, I’ve prioritized the implementation of modernized baggage scanning technology in U.S. airports. We must continue to provide the American People with the best technology available to counter constantly-evolving threats both at home and abroad, while ensuring smooth and efficient travel.

8/5/18 18:37,Wildfire funding and protecting Lake Tahoe,"￼
￼
￼
￼
￼
￼
Dear Friend,
In Washington, D.C., this week was one of progress, and let me tell you – it was a good one for the state of Nevada. From securing additional funding to fight wildfires to announcing federal investment in rural Nevada's broadband expansion efforts to making sure that nuclear waste isn’t forced on Nevada, I’m proud to give you an update on what I’ve been working on this week.
Last year, Nevada experienced one of the worst fire seasons on record, and this year isn’t looking much better, so one of my top priorities is making sure that Nevada has the resources and tools it needs to prevent wildfires that threaten our communities and the Tahoe Basin that we love. This week, the U.S. Senate passed legislation that included $5 million in additional funding that I secured to help prevent wildfires that know no boundaries in the West, and $12 million to implement my bill – the Lake Tahoe Restoration and Reauthorization Act – to protect Lake Tahoe from wildfires and invasive species. I also made sure that funding is available for cutting-edge fire prevention technologies, like AlertTahoe, an innovative camera system that has already helped prevent more than 50 fires in the Tahoe Basin from reaching one acre in size, so I will continue to push my colleagues to support cutting-edge solutions that could help mitigate the damage from potentially devastating wildfires.
￼ 
At a meeting earlier this year with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue discussing wildfire prevention measures, including AlertTahoe, in Nevada and across the West.
I’d like to add that this legislation that the Senate passed also fully funded the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program – something that I pushed for because I know how important it is for Nevada’s local governments. I also authored several other provisions - ranging from preserving Nevada’s clean water supply to promoting smart city solutions and helping low-income families maximize their tax returns – in the Senate-passed bill. Learn more by clicking HERE.
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: Lincoln County Record: Nevada Wildfires a Concern to Heller 
This week, the Senate also passed the reconciled defense bill…WITHOUT the $30 million that was included in the version passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. I wasn’t going to let the U.S. House of Representatives use the defense bill as a vehicle to revive Yucca Mountain, so I worked with the Senate Armed Services Committee to keep Yucca Mountain out of the final product that we sent to the President’s desk.
￼ 
Meeting with Ed & Cindi Yenick of BubHugs in my Reno office to talk about their unique program to educate youth about opioid use disorder and addiction. 
I also want you to know that I continue to closely monitor the situation at the border. Just this week, I – along with a bipartisan group of senators - pressed Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Department of Health and Human Service to give Congress regular updates on the status of the reunification of separated families at the border. Keeping families together should be the default position of this country, and that’s why back in June, I urged Attorney General Sessions to stop separating families at the border until Congress can pass legislation. To that end – I helped introduce a bill, the Keep Families Together and Enforce the Law Act, that will make the policy of keeping families together permanent.
As always, it’s an honor to represent you in the U.S. Senate. I have offices in Reno, Las Vegas, and Washington, D.C., and I encourage you to contact us – we’re here to help you.

Dear Friends, 

It's been a busy week here in central Arkansas. I have had the chance to meet with families, hardworking Arkansans, job creators, our brave heroes, and future Arkansas leaders. I'm humbled to serve as your Congressman; thank you for allowing me to represent you. Here are a few highlights from my week in the Natural State. 

A Day in the Life of a Small Business Owner 
￼
I spent part of Thursday working alongside central Arkansas’s small business owners at Viper Industrial Products, Klassmeyer Construction Company, and Suspended Systems Inc. This was part of the NFIB's Small Business Challenge. The day included talking to customers, packing boxes, repairing broken industrial nail guns, driving a forklift, and hearing from our job creators. I always impressed by the men and women of central Arkansas who get up each day to serve their communities and families.

Hearing from Our Heroes 
￼
I appreciated 30 members of my Saline County and Perry County Veterans Advisory Committees joining me for lunch on Monday at the VFW Post 2256 in Benton. We discussed the House’s work to care and provide for our veterans and how I can best serve them. Special thanks go to Benton Mayor Jill Dabbs and Bryant Chief of Police Mark Kizer participating. 

Honoring Korean War Arkansas Veteran Guy Carr 
￼
I was honored to present Korean War veteran Guy E. Carr, United States Air Force Airman First Class, with five military medals on Friday at Brookdale Assisted Living Center in Conway, Arkansas. 

Mr. Carr served in the Air Force from December 27, 1950, to November 3,1953. He was originally trained as a Senior Turret Systems Mechanic and Gunner, but upon arriving in Kunson Korea, he was retrained as a flight systems engineer, as they did not need additional gunners. Mr. Carr went on to fly 54 nighttime combat missions while in Korea. 

For his service to our nation reflective of his warrior spirit, Mr. Carr received the Distinguished Flying Cross for gallantry, two Air Medals for bravery in combat, the Korean Service Medal awarded by the United States serving in the Korean War, and the United Nations Korean Service Medal for serving in the Korean War. 

Caring for Those With Diabetes   
 ￼
I really enjoyed my visit with Chloe (lower left) and Hadley (lower right) representing the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. Both Chloe and Hadley have Type 1 diabetes, and we talked about how medical breakthroughs supported by the Congress are helping them live life. 

Supporting Our Arkansas Youth
￼
It’s always good to be with my friend Fitz Hill and others at Arkansas Baptist College to discuss the important work being done to lower recidivism rates and decrease the number of youth in our Arkansas foster care system through the Restore Hope project.

Talking With You
￼
Thank you to everyone who participated in my Telephone Town Hall on Thursday night. We tackled a range of issues, including health care, immigration, skilled workforce, election security, and education. I always appreciate the opportunity to hear from you.

Spending Time with Pat Ward and Kristian Nelson
￼
Thank you to my good friend, Pat Ward, for having me on Arkansas Talks this week. I enjoyed talking with her and Kristian Nelson about what we're doing to strengthen and empower our Arkansas communities, fix our broken immigration system, and much more.
 
Supporting Arkansas Humanities
￼
I was humbled to receive the 2018 Tom Dillard Advocacy Award this week. This award is given for demonstrating a sustained commitment to promoting the study, appreciation, preservation, and dissemination of Arkansas history. Thank you to Mark Christ (right) and the Arkansas Historic Preservation Program for all you to keep Arkansas history alive. 

Thank you for taking time to keep up with the work I'm doing on your behalf. If I can be any assistance to you or your family, please reach out to my office at (501) 324-5941 or go to my website at hill.house.gov.

Sincerely,
￼

NEWS FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT
Dear Friend,

This week, we heard from veterans organizations and the VA about long-term care for aging veterans. We also worked to lower health care costs. Please read about my week below: 

Veterans' Long-Term Care
￼ 
This week, the House VA Subcommittee on Health held a hearing on the Department of Veterans Affairs long-term care and how it can be improved to best serve our aging veterans. The average age of the veteran population has increased over the years, as has the number of veterans who qualify for VA-supported long-term care. I questioned witnesses about how various VA long-term care programs work together, what the eligibility requirements are for these programs, how the VA will manage increased demand, and what services veterans would like to have available to them as they age.
Click here to learn more. 

Fixing Our Broken Health Care System
Last month, the House took action on the health care front in an effort to expand access and lower costs for all. We passed a package of bills aimed at expanding Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and voted to repeal the job-crushing medical device tax. HSAs contribute to lower healthcare spending by promoting consumer driven healthcare. We passed legislation to nearly double the contribution limit, end the prohibition on purchasing over-the-counter medications, expand access to HSAs, and allow HSAs to be used by working seniors. The problems with Obamacare and the harm it is causing throughout the healthcare system are not going away. As we work to pass the rest of our strong, conservative agenda, I will not stop working to repeal Obamacare so we can fix our broken health care system, expand access, and lower costs for all.

ISSUES AND LEGISLATION 
August 05, 2018 
ICYMI: House Passes H.R. 6199:
On July 25th, my bill H.R.6199, Restoring Access to Medication and Expanding Health Savings Account Act of 2018, passed the House with strong bipartisan support by a vote of 277-142.
Cosponsored by Representatives Ron Kind (D-WI), Eric Paulsen (R-MN), and Grace Meng (D-NY), the legislation gives Americans greater ability to control how they spend their Flexible Spending Arrangements (FSAs), Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), and other similar tax preferred health accounts by restoring access to over-the-counter medications. Current law under the Affordable Care Act requires consumer to obtain a doctor’s prescription for over-the-counter medications in order to be eligible for reimbursement under their consumer health savings accounts. In addition, this package would also expand the scope of HSAs by allowing plans to cover telehealth appointments, allowing contributions to an HSA if a spouse has a health FSA, and adding certain qualified sports and fitness expenses to be treated as medical expenses, among other changes.
The policies in H.R.6199 are common-sense approaches to expanding and restoring health care access to millions of Americans. For example, over-the-counter medications are often the frontline treatment for many common illnesses or for maintenance of chronic disease. Over-the-counter medications should be treated as medically reimbursable healthcare therapies, just as prescription drugs are. I am pleased that he House voted to restore Americans’ access to medication and modernize HSAs and hope the Senate will take action soon on this bipartisan legislation.
You can view my full remarks on the House floor in support of H.R.6199 here. My opening statement at the Rules Committee on all of this week’s important Ways and Means legislation can be viewed here.
 
H.R.3500, Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act:
Last week, on behalf of my colleague Congresswoman Kristi Noem of South Dakota, I offered legislation that provides additional safeguards within the IRS by prohibiting the agency from rehiring any individual previously employed by the IRS but removed for misconduct or terminated for cause. For example, instances include IRS employees who threatened their co-workers, didn’t pay their own taxes, were excessively absent, falsified employment forms, or were so deficient at their jobs that the IRS had no choice but to terminate their employment.
IRS employees have access to Americans’ most sensitive information, such as our Social Security Numbers, home addresses, and how much we are paid. Given the magnitude of the sensitive information that the IRS holds, hiring employees of high integrity is essential to maintaining public trust in tax administration and safeguarding taxpayer information. As Chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee, I applaud Congresswoman Noem for sponsoring this legislation and I was glad to request its passage on the House floor.
You can view my full remarks on the House floor in support of Congresswoman Noem’s H.R.3500 here.
 
FabLab STEM Camp Showcase:
It was wonderful to visit the Independent Community College campus on the last day of a three-week STEM camp for over 100 middle school girls. I enjoyed seeing the students showcasing their projects that resulted from a program curriculum that touched on everything from 3D printing, coding/electronics, design, entrepreneurship, and more. STEM is extremely important to our 21st century workforce and I am pleased to support the collaboration of FabLab and the Independence Community College as they advance such education.
 
Kansas Primary – August 7th:
President Ronald Reagan once stated that “Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same.” One of the most fundamental ways we can ensure the protection of our freedom and democracy is by exercising our right to vote.
I encourage all of my fellow Kansans to find their nearest polling booth and vote during the upcoming August 7th primary.

Building a Stronger Military
 
 
It is the responsibility of Congress to ""provide for the common defense,"" of our nation and that means we must pass legislation that supports our brave military men and women who sacrifice and serve our nation so that we can be safe here are at home. I have always understood that my number one constitutional responsibility is the common defense of our nation. To live up to that responsibility we must fund our military with the tools, equipment, and resources they need to do their jobs and so they can come back home to the ones that love and care for them. We also have a moral obligation to care for their families. 

In the 115th Congress, I have lived up to that obligation by passing the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Not only are we providing more tanks, planes, and ships (many built right here in south Mississippi) but we have included a much deserved 2.6% pay raise - the largest in nine years. 

Sadly, under Obama, our friends no longer trusted us and our enemies no longer feared us because the devastating cuts to our military made us weak. Our military readiness took a nose dive, as Obama cared more about social experimentation and safe spaces than building the world's most lethal military. 

But now, I thank God for President Trump's embrace or Reagan's principle of ""peace through strength."" A strong lethal military is the best deterrent to war - and you don't need to be Clausewitz to know that. The Republican led Congress knows this and has fully funded our military for the past two years to start us back on the path of rebuilding the world's greatest military. 

Learn more about how Republicans in Congress are caring for our military at betteroffnow.gop. 

Secretary of the Army
I was honored to welcome the Secretary of the Army, Dr. Mark T. Esper to Camp Shelby last week. I was glad he could see the great things we have to offer and the significant role our south Mississippi military bases play in strengthening our national defense. We were able to discuss Camp Shelby’s capabilities as well as modernization efforts and overall readiness initiatives. Check out a few pictures from his visit to the nation's best and largest state-owned training site below.

As you are aware, I have the opportunity to provide internships to young Mississippians in my Washington and Mississippi offices. Every fall, spring, and summer semester I’m joined by some of Mississippi’s best and brightest. Now, I would like to continue introducing to you some of the hard working young women who are serving as interns in my Washington, D.C. office this summer! 
￼
This Julia Grant, a Gulfport High School alumna who is currently attending the University of Mississippi where she studies Public Policy Leadership and Economics. She is the daughter of Ashley and Kas Grant and enjoys reading, jogging, and cooking in her free time.

Q&A
Why did you decide to intern in D.C.?
""I find D.C. to be the most engaging, energizing city in the nation. It is such a young, vibrant city, and each person has an interest in developing his or her knowledge and understanding of the world. Everyone is genuinely excited about the work they are doing, or the goals they hope to achieve in the future. It is uplifting.""

What about politics interests you?
""Truthfully, it’s not really politics that interest me; I am more interested in the policy created once all of the politics are said and done. "" 

What is the most eye-opening about working on Capitol Hill?
""I think the most eye-opening thing about working on Capitol Hill is how much goes on behind the scenes. Americans at home merely see elected and appointed officials; yet, behind these officials are teams of people working diligently to help them carry out their duties to serve the American people."" 

What have you learned since being in D.C.?
""The world is a small place.  Use that to your advantage.  Also, confidence is important, but humility is key."" 

What’s some advice you have for someone looking to intern in D.C.?
""Make a group of friends and go to trivia in one of the many restaurants that offer it across the city! It is one of the most fun ways to unwind after work and spend time with other interns who are likely interested in the same topics as you are.""

What's your favorite memory in D.C. or Congressman Palazzo's office?
""My favorite memory in DC thus far is watching the Fourth of July fireworks from the steps of the Capitol. I watched the fireworks explode over the national monument while an artist performed her renditions of classic patriotic songs—it was an experience like none other.""

What have you learned since being in D.C.? 
""One of the most significant and difficult things I’ve learned is simply how to live in a city. Public transportation is confusing and tough, two miles may as well be a marathon distance, and going grocery shopping is an all-day event. However, with these trade-offs come enormous benefits—delicious restaurants dot the city, innovative exercise studios are throughout the town, and there is always something new to discover."" 

Please enjoy what's left of your summer, and good luck to all the students starting school this week. Hang in there folks, college football is right around the corner!

In your service,

Dear Lindsey, 
It was a jam-packed week of meetings and events throughout Southwest Alabama. We visited five different counties and put hundreds of miles on the car as we traveled the First District to learn what issues are on people's minds. Below are seven photos that help sum up the busy week on the road! 
￼ 
Our first town hall meeting of the week was in the Salipta community in Clarke County. According to then local press, it was the first time a congressman has ever visited the community!
￼ 
I had the opportunity to ride along with UPS last week to see firsthand what their job entails. It was an eye-opening experience. Thanks to Chris Dorgan for showing me the ropes!
￼ 
While in Atmore, I was able to check out the new, cool mural being painted downtown. It is always a joy to be in Escambia County!
￼ 
I always enjoy visiting local businesses to learn more about the challenges they face. I stopped by Serda Brewing in Mobile, and I was thrilled to learn that the tax reform bill we passed last year has helped their business!
￼ 
We had a great town hall in Millry, one of six town hall meetings we held last week. Other stops were in Salipta, Atmore, Brewton, Dauphin Island, and Citronelle.
￼ 
I had a very informative tour and visit to Olin in McIntosh. They employ over 400 people and have been operating in our area since 1952.
￼ 
We wrapped things up for the week at the annual Women's Forum in downtown Mobile organized by the Community Foundation of South Alabama. This year's guest speaker was Susie Redman, a Mobile-native and LPGA golfer!
￼ 
Bonus: After a busy week, I was thrilled to be able to spend some time with the family, including my grandson MacGuire. 
More Town Hall Meetings 
￼ 
I will continue my ""Better Off Now"" Town Hall Tour on Wednesday with a stop out in west Mobile at the Connie Hudson Senior Center. Later this month, we have more town halls planned in Grand Bay, Monroeville, Seminole, Loxley, and Spanish Fort. I hope you will mark your calendars and invite others to attend!

What's Ahead 
The August District Work Period continues this week, and I look forward to continuing to get around Southwest Alabama. Priorities this week will focus on our national security, Red Snapper fishing, taking care of our veterans, and visiting local businesses. Despite what some may believe, the August District Work Period is very busy and allows me to be a better Congressman.

Congressman McHenry Weekly Update 


Hearing From You



This week I was back home in the Tenth District, where I hosted the first three of this year's annual town halls. I enjoyed getting to hear the issues and concerns most important to Tenth District residents. On Wednesday morning we had a well attended town hall event at the Riceville Fire Department.

￼

We then headed over to Hickory to speak with constituents from Catawba County that afternoon.

￼

On Thursday, I hosted my third scheduled town hall event for constituents from Lincoln and Iredell County at the East Lincoln Fire Department.
 
￼

Thank you to everyone who participated in the town halls. Next week I will be hosting additional town halls for Rutherford, Polk, Gaston, and Cleveland County constituents. You can find the times and locations for these events below.    

 ￼





Back Home in the Tenth District



Last week I was back home in the Tenth District for the House of Representatives' yearly August district work period. I started the week in Buncombe County at the Asheville Chamber of Commerce luncheon, where I enjoyed talking about Opportunity Zones created by the Tax Cut and Jobs Act.

￼

I then headed to the Asheville Mall where it was good to hear about future plans and visit with a few of the local businesses that got their start at the mall.

￼

That afternoon, I participated in an opioid discussion roundtable with community leaders who are addressing the opioid crisis in Buncombe County and Western North Carolina.

￼

I ended my day with a visit to the Fairview Animal Hospital, where I had the opportunity to congratulate them on receiving the Rural Energy for America Program grant, which is being used for a solar array at their facility.

￼

On Thursday, it was great to catch up with the executive committee of the North Carolina State Firefighters Association to discuss issues affecting the fire service. I'm proud to say most of the current state officers are from the Tenth District.

￼

I also enjoyed joining North Carolina's newest State Senator, Vickie Sawyer, for the Lincolnton-Lincoln County Chamber of Commerce's annual Legislative Luncheon. Senator Sawyer was actually sworn a few hours later to fill the vacant District 44 seat. It was great to speak to Lincoln County business and civic leaders about tax reform and all that is happening in Washington.

￼





Release Pastor Andrew Brunson



Thank you to President Trump and his Administration for following through on their commitment to holding the Turkish government accountable for their continued detention of Pastor Andrew Brunson. Pastor Brunson has done nothing wrong and should be released now. Click here to learn more about what the Administration is doing to free Pastor Brunson. Watch the speech I delivered on the House floor calling for the release of Pastor Brunson by clicking here or on the image below.

What I Have Been Reading



Worker Pay Rate Hits Highest Level Since 2008

CNBC 

It is easy to see why so many Americans are feeling more confident in our economy when we hear good news like worker pay rate hitting its highest level in ten years. It is great to see tax reform continuing to help our economy grow.                                              


U.S. Consumer Spending Stayed Solid In June

Bloomberg 

This latest report is just another example of the positive effect of letting taxpayers keep more of their hard earned money. It also shows that tax reform is more than just cutting taxes as our economy continues to grow. Consumer confidence is hitting some of its highest levels thanks to our booming economy. 


Jobless Claims Cling Near 45 Year Low

Market Watch 

Another reason why tax reform is helping make Americans better off is more jobs. Virtually every industry is hiring, which is why we've seen our unemployment at some of the lowest levels in almost 50 years.

Friends,
 
As a father, I pray for the good health of my family and loved ones. Good health is a blessing – whether that’s physical, mental, or emotional. 
 
And a critical factor in overall wellness is access to quality health services.
 
That’s one reason why I have worked hard to advance polices that ensure everyone has access to high-quality, timely, and more affordable health care. As part of my efforts, I met with patients, caregivers and health care providers at a local dialysis center last week. We had a great discussion about different ideas like the bipartisan Dialysis PATIENTS Demonstration Act (H.R. 4143), which I’m proud to cosponsor. As a leader on the Energy and Commerce Committee and the committee tasked with writing most of the nation’s health care laws, I support this legislation which would introduce a pilot program to significantly expand access to integrated care for dialysis patients.
 
By the same token, I’m working to address one of the biggest public health crises in our country. The opioid epidemic is devastating our small towns and rural communities. And while I’m proud of the bipartisan work we’ve done so far – from investing billions of dollars for recovery and prevention, to bolstering efforts to fight deadly illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl – there’s still so much more work to do.
 
Last week, I invited Anne Hazlett, the Assistant to the Secretary for Rural Development at the United States Department of Agriculture, to Hoke County to meet with Hope-N-Hoke, a group consisting of local medical professionals, law enforcement, elected officials and community leaders who work to find solutions to the opioid crisis in the county. They’re doing an outstanding job, and I want to make sure they have the resources they need. I’ll continue to work to connect local leaders with federal leaders and decision makers to make sure we have the resource and tools we need for our priorities. I see that as one of my core responsibilities as your representative in Congress. 
 
Last, but certainly not least, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina – the only health insurance company covering all 100 counties in our state – announced they were lowering health insurance rates for the first time under Obamacare. Blue Cross cited the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a factor in the lowered rates. To put this in perspective, in 2015, rates increased by 13.5%; in 2016, by 32.5%; and in 2017, by 24.3%.
 
Make no mistake, after years of double-digit rate hikes, this is good news. 
 
But we can do better. Imagine the lower costs and additional options patients could have if the Senate followed the House’s action to repeal and replace Obamacare with a patient-centered, market-based health care system that prioritizes affordability, quality and choice.
 
I want to return control of health care from Washington back to you and restore the free market so you can access quality, affordable health care options that meet your needs. And this can be done while protecting coverage for pre-existing conditions. The health of our community isn’t a partisan issue. I give you my word I’ll continue to work to find bipartisan solutions.
 
 
Until next week,
￼
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress (NC-08)

August 05, 2018 
Dear Friend,
Hope everyone is enjoying a safe and fun-filled summer with their families. We had an important week to close out July with a big bipartisan vote on my bill to permanently repeal the Medical Device Tax -- something very important to Minnesota because of our 35,000 jobs in the medtech industry. More on that below. 
I visited Winsupply in Eden Prairie, a locally-owned supplier of electrical and HVAC equipment. Winsupply shared a similar story I'm hearing from so many employers -- tax reform is making our economy boom and creating more job opportunities, but they are having difficulty finding people to fill these jobs. Nationally, for the first time ever we have more job openings than job seekers!
On other tax news I am authoring new bipartisan legislation to make it easier for people to make charitable contributions (especially middle-income folks) through charitable giving accounts setup with an employer. It would function similar to a health savings account, where an employee and employer have easier ways to facilitate donations and see a tax benefit from charitable contributions. The bill will lessen the paperwork burden on taxpayers -- and spur more giving to the kinds of charities that do vital work for Minnesota. Learn more about the bill here.
Have a great week and please let me know whenever I can be of assistance to you or your family. Join the conversation online by visiting my website, Facebook page, Twitter, and Instagram, and please watch the latest Erik's Correspondence Corner video.

￼
 
Sincerely,
 
￼ Erik Paulsen Member of Congress
 
Repealing the Medical Device Tax 
The medical device industry is an American success story and vitally important to Minnesota's economy. There are more than 35,000 Minnesotans employed by the medtech sector, mostly at small and growing companies you've probably never even heard of. But the onerous excise tax on all medical device sales (not profits) resulted in the loss of 29,000 jobs across the country and less development of life-improving and life-saving medical devices that are important to patients. 
That's why I continue to lead the charge to repeal the Medical Device Tax once and for all. The good news is we scored a big win when the House voted on a strong bipartisan basis to pass my legislation for a permanent repeal of this job-killing tax. I will continue to work with others, including Sen. Klobuchar, to see that this repeal is signed into law. Read more about the vote and what it means for Minnesota here.
￼
WATCH: Rep. Paulsen speaks on the House floor in support of his bill repealing the Medical Device Tax
 
More Good Economic News 
The good economic news just keeps rolling in. America’s economy has taken off, growing at a 4.1 percent pace thanks to a more competitive tax code and real regulatory reform. Revisions to last quarter’s GDP show the economy is even stronger than we thought. What's more, just on Friday we learned that the employment-to-population ratio is at its highest since January 2009 and the unemployment rate dropped to 3.9 percent. 
This economy is leaving no one behind: the unemployment rate for those without high school diplomas is its lowest ever and those who want to work full-time but can only find part-time employment is the lowest since December 2007. We need to continue to build on this momentum. I will continue working to modernize the tax code so it is more small business friendly, more innovation friendly, and more family friendly, as well as support initiatives that make it easier for families to save and invest.
 
￼
 
Progress in the Fight Against Opioid Abuse
Synthetic drugs like fentanyl have become the most lethal kind of opioid, murdering hundreds of Minnesotans each year. They're far more lethal than other opioids, and most of them come in from overseas. I'm working to close one glaring loophole that is making it easier for traffickers of fentanyl to evade detection by our law enforcement personnel. 
I visited the UPS facility in Maple Grove to meet with law enforcement, postal inspectors and others to discuss this effort and get their views. Learn more about the visit and my work to keep synthetic opioids from reaching our shores here.
 
￼
Rep. Paulsen meeting with law enforcement and leaders from UPS to talk about how we can prevent traffickers from smuggling fentanyl into the U.S. 
 
Making Medications More Affordable 
Rising drug costs are a growing problem for Minnesota families. It's a complicated problem with no easy solutions, but there are steps that can be taken to ensure medications are more affordable. 
I've introduced bipartisan legislation with Rep. Anna Eshoo from California called the True Cost-Sharing Of Seniors' drugs Transparency (True COST) Act to help patients make better-informed decisions when paying for their medications.
Here's how: some pharmacists operate under rules that restrict them from informing a patient when the cash price of a drug is lower than what they would pay through their insurance plan. Called ""gag clauses"", the bottom line is that you may be paying more for your drugs than necessary -- but your pharmacist is prohibited from telling you unless you ask them specifically.
These restrictions are not in consumers' best interests. Our bill is another way to make it more affordable for Minnesotans to get the medical care and treatment they need.

Dear Friends,   Hope you're having a wonderful Sunday. I wanted to take a quick second to share with you some updates from Wisconsin and Washington this Summer. 
Our Economy Continues To Grow 
Republicans in Congress have worked tirelessly to enact laws that reduce the size and scope of government, allow you to keep more of your hard-earned money, and encourage small businesses to hire more workers. 
The American people see the results of these pro-growth policies. Not only is unemployment down and economic optimism up, but workers have also received their biggest pay bump in almost a decade!  
The Department of Labor recently reported that U.S. workers received their largest pay increases since 2008.

Connecting the Seventh District 
 
 
I met with Horry Telephone Cooperative (HTC) this week to discuss our shared priority of improving the Seventh District's broadband infrastructure. Reliable broadband internet provides important employment, educational, and health opportunities that are essential to engaging in today's economy. In the Seventh District, building robust broadband infrastructure will create jobs, attract new industries, and improve the quality of life in rural areas. HTC is doing important work for the Seventh District and I will continue to look for opportunities to improve broadband connectivity in our region. 
 

￼
 
 
Less Time on Paperwork, More Time Serving You
 
 
I joined Synovus Bank Advisory Board's monthly meeting to discuss policies that directly impact the banking community and their customers- small businesses, entrepreneurs, and families. I was happy to report that President Trump recently signed the most pro-growth financial reform package in twenty years, releasing Dodd-Frank's regulatory chokehold on small financial institutions. I received positive feedback about how easing duplicative regulations will allow Seventh District banks to better serve their customers and our community!
 

￼
 
 
Increasing Charitable Giving 
 
 
It was great to meet with leaders from local chapters of charitable organizations this week. We had a productive discussion about ways to increase charitable giving as well as the important work these organizations do in the Seventh District. I am so thankful for their dedication to lifting people up in our community! 
 

￼
 
 
HSA Legislation Passes House
 
 
As I traveled through the district this week, many of you asked me what Congress is doing to lower the cost of health care. While my colleagues and I continue to pursue comprehensive health care reform, we are also working to enact targeted policies that will lower costs and expand choice. Just last week, the House passed two pieces of legislation that expand Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). HSAs are used by over 20 million Americans and put individuals and families in control of how their health care dollars are spent. These bills will increase choice and lower costs for South Carolinians struggling to afford health insurance under Obamacare. You can watch my floor speech in support of these important bills below.

Continued Benefits of Tax Reform
This week, I visited Omnicell, a health care automation company in Butler County, where I had the opportunity to speak with business leaders about how tax reform is helping Pennsylvania employers grow and stay globally competitive.
Because of tax reform, Omnicell is reinvesting in the company, buying new equipment, and hiring more employees. Tax reform continues to generate positive economic news. On Friday, the Labor Department announced the unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent. For the first time in 20 years, there are now more job openings than workers available to fill them.
I appreciated the opportunity to get a firsthand look at a cutting-edge employer that's creating a lot of jobs right here in Pennsylvania.
Read more about my visit in the Cranberry Eagle.
￼
￼
Visiting Eagles Mere Air Museum
While visiting Sullivan County, I had the chance to visit Eagles Mere Air Museum this week. Founded in 2008, the museum includes approximately 30 vintage aircraft and engines, with a focus on aviation between 1917 and 1944. Many of the airplanes featured are the best remaining examples of their particular model. The museum is a premier tourist destination for families vacationing in the Endless Mountains region of Pennsylvania.
In addition to the planes featured in the museum, several other aircraft are currently in various phases of restoration.
Learn more about the Eagles Mere Air Museum here.

Getting Feedback from Constituents
My duties as a United States Senator frequently keep me in Washington, so I do my best to stay in touch and hear about the issues that matter to you. The feedback I receive from you greatly informs the work I do.  
This week, I held my 56th tele-town hall and answered questions on issues spanning from the economy and tariffs, to the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Over 10,000 Pennsylvanians were able to join the conversation.
I always appreciate feedback from my constituents, and I look forward to hosting more forums like this in the future.
Read more about my tele town hall in WESA.

￼
Expanding Consumer Choices
For years, federal rules and onerous government regulations dramatically increased the cost of health insurance while also taxing those who did not want it, or couldn't afford it.
This week, the Trump Administration expanded flexibility and choice in the health care market by increasing the amount of time an individual can have short-term health care coverage.
Due to a regulation crafted late in the Obama Administration, short-term, limited duration health insurance plans were only available for three months and were non-renewable. This week's announcement extends the duration of these plans up to 364 days and permits the plan to be renewed for up to three years.
The administration's announcement, coupled with the repeal of the individual mandate, is a good step towards restoring affordable and renewable health insurance options to the millions of Americans who have been left behind by Obamacare.
This decision will bring about greater flexibility and choice in the health care market and I applaud the administration's move.

Tenney Kicks Off Second Year of Renew NY-22 Tour with Infrastructure Week
On Monday, I began the second year of Renew NY-22, a plan I introduced last year to create jobs, grow the economy and increase economic opportunity in upstate New York. After taking what I learned from my tour of the district back to Washington, I started another tour of the district to highlight what was accomplished and the work that still needs to be done. During the month of August I will continue the Renew NY-22 tour of our district. This week, emphasized the need to invest in infrastructure in a fiscally responsible way that targets those projects most in need of support. 
On Monday morning, I kicked off infrastructure week at the Deansboro Water Development Facility to see firsthand how federal dollars are being spent to support and upgrade our water infrastructure. I then visited the Vernon Center to speak with local officials about the proposed Vernon Center Water District. The tour highlighted water systems identified in a needs survey conducted by New York Rural Water Association Circuit Rider Doug Smorol, who joined me on the tour.
Due to a lack of strong and sustained investments, America’s infrastructure is lagging behind—especially in rural communities like the 22nd District. I had the opportunity to tour Deansboro Water Development Facility which serves hundreds of people throughout the Town of Marshall. It is vital that rural water facilities are properly funded to ensure safe drinking water. During my tour, I met with David Lenhart, a Vernon resident whose drinking water was contaminated with salt. Safe drinking water is a priority for every community and through Renew NY-22, I’ll continue to ensure our municipalities receive the funding to support and upgrade rural infrastructure.

Cybersecurity Workshop with Local Small Businesses 
Nearly 50% of small businesses experience cyber-attacks. However, our small businesses rarely have the additional resources to invest in improving cybersecurity as it is often a complex and costly undertaking. This forum will provide our local small business community with training on methods to mitigate cyber-attack risks and provide guidance on ways to harden cyber infrastructure.I am grateful to the Mohawk Valley SBDC and the Rome Chamber of Commerce for working alongside our office to provide this important training for our local business community. 
As part of my Renew NY-22 tour, I hosted a cybersecurity workshop on Tuesday morning to provide small businesses with training on ways to handle increasing cyber threats. The event was cosponsored by the Rome Chamber of Commerce, Mohawk Valley Small Business Development Center (SBDC) and Anjolen Cybersecurity. 
In an increasingly ever-connected society, cybersecurity is an important component of our broadband infrastructure. This is particularly the case for small businesses who rely on e-commerce to expand the reach of goods and services. 
￼ 
Rep. Claudia Tenney at Cybersecurity Workshop 
Small Businesses Need Reliable Infrastructure to Grow
Investments and innovations in infrastructure, especially in rural communities, are critically important to small businesses like Yorkville Battery. From roads and bridges to broadband access, reliable infrastructure provides certainty and stability empowering businesses to focus on growing and expanding. Through advancements in broadband infrastructure, small businesses like Yorkville Battery are able to grow through access to new markets, customers, and services.
On Tuesday, I toured Yorkville Battery as part of the Renew NY-22 infrastructure week. I toured the facility, met with employees and learned more about the operation. Since 1975, Yorkville Battery has become the one-stop source for any battery application, including tractor batteries, powersport batteries and cell phone batteries.
In Congress, I have supported rural economies by voting to provide $2.6 billion for infrastructure development, housing needs and loans to expand rural businesses and industries. 
￼ 
Rep. Claudia Tenney visits Yorkville Battery        
On Thursday, I visited Willow Run Foods Inc. as part of my tour highlighting important investments and innovations to Renew NY-22. Willow Run is the premier fast food distributor in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. Based in the 22nd District, Willow Run serves customers in 14 states from Maine to Virginia.  During the tour, I learned Willow Run Foods is an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) company. This allows employees to share in the growth and prosperity of the company, enabling the employees to work harder and ultimately contribute more to our economy. 
Revitalizing and upgrading our infrastructure and transportation systems is a vital step in bringing new opportunities to our region and business community. Reliable infrastructure connects employees with employers and consumers with local small businesses. In New York a lack of investment in infrastructure has burdened our local businesses that rely on dependable infrastructure to effectively serve their customers. I'll continue to advocate for funding to ensure our rural communities have the necessary resources to upgrade infrastructure.
￼ 
Rep. Claudia Tenney tours Willow Run Foods Inc. with CEO Terry Wood 
On Thursday, I also visited Kris-Tech Wire as part of my tour highlighting important investments and innovations to Renew NY-22. Kris-Tech Wire, a family owned multi-generational business, is a vertically integrated wire manufacturer serving commercial buildings, water and gas, solar, explosives industries, and more.  
On the tour, Graham Brodock the President and CEO informed me that Kris-Tech Wire has reinvested in the company as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Kris-Tech is building an addition and acquiring new equipment-thanks to the newly created ability to write off equipment charges. Kris-Tech has over 400 employees and a deep commitment to continuing to invest in the facility and employees here in Rome.    Since 1984 Kris-Tech Wire has faithfully served our community, becoming a nationally renowned leader in the copper wire industry. Businesses like Kris-Tech are proof that providing desperately needed relief from the failed ‘tax and spend’ status quo helps to improve and grow the economy. Not only did Kris-Tech give back to employees as a result of tax reform but has for years given back to the community through public service projects and donations. 
During our visit, the Kris-Tech team highlighted this important initiative called Kris-Tech CARES. From supporting a local baseball league to repainting and providing a new roof for our local senior center, this is proof that our small businesses are among the most generous in our community. In Congress, I’ll continue to advocate for business-friendly policies including strong and reliable infrastructure to ensure our local businesses can grow, expand and continue to give back to the community.

Providing Infrastructure Funding for Rural Communities 
America’s rural communities have been left behind due to a lack of strong and sustained investments. It is vital that our water infrastructure in rural communities like the 22nd District is properly funded to ensure safe, clean drinking water.  
On Wednesday, I announced that a total of $4,229,000 in federal funds from the Department of Agriculture has been awarded to the towns of Mexico and Lenox and the Village of Boonville. This funding comes as I head on another tour of the 22nd District to highlight Renew NY-22, my plan to revitalize and renew opportunities for our region. This funding will be used for improving our rural infrastructure and expanding water access for rural areas. 
Listening to the needs of our Seniors 
On Wednesday, I visited the Northern Broome Community Center as part of the Renew NY-22 tour. Located in Whitney Point, the Northern Broome Community Center has been part of the community for over 35 years. The facility provides nutrition programs and activities on a daily basis for seniors throughout the region. 
Northern Broome Community Center offers vital services to hundreds of seniors in the area. During my visit I had the opportunity to tour the facility, play cards and eat chicken spiedes with seniors at the center. It was an opportunity to learn more about the issues impacting our Upstate New York seniors including a lack of access to affordable senior housing. In Congress, I have always been an advocate for our seniors especially working to protect and strengthen Medicare and Social Security.

On Thursday, I had the opportunity to visit the Ava Dorfman Senior Center, which provides important services to our senior citizens throughout Oneida County. It was great to sit down with residents and learn firsthand about the everyday issues impacting our Upstate senior community. Medicare and Social Security are lifelines for our senior citizens, and I will continue my advocacy in Congress to protect and preserve these vital programs.

Combatting the Opioid Epidemic  
Thank you to the Hamilton Police Department and the Hamilton Area Community Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention for your continued dedication in working to combat the opioid scourge in our community. Drop boxes like the one installed here will go a long way toward preventing unnecessary addiction and death. In Congress, I will continue to work to ensure we bring forth meaningful solutions that will end this epidemic and make our families and communities whole again.

From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:
Good Afternoon,
This week in Congress, I added my name to a growing list of lawmakers calling on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to push for access to the next wave of diabetes management technologies.
￼
Expanding Diabetes Management Technologies
I was pleased to sit down with Dan Lankford of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and Miranda Dincher, the mother of Thomas who was recently diagnosed with juvenile diabetes. Hearing Thomas’s story reaffirmed my steadfast commitment to this critical issue. I will continue to advocate on behalf of people with type 1 diabetes and support new treatments and therapies that will make daily life with this disease easier.  
Promoting Gun Safety and Rights
On Tuesday, I had the opportunity to visit the National Range & Amory in Williamsport and meet the owner, Adam Kordes.
￼
During my time at the range, Adam and I discussed the importance of 2nd Amendment rights, specifically Eric’s Law and the ability for corrections officers to protect themselves without carrying a weapon. Thank you to Adam and his team of professionals for educating our community with the proper use of firearms. August is National Shooting Sports Month and a great time to get to the range.
Bridging the Digital Divide
Thank you to Mansfield University for facilitating a productive roundtable with public and private experts regarding rural broadband access.
￼
The disparity of internet access between urban and rural areas translates to tremendously negative impacts on local economies. Because of the lack of widespread broadband deployment, rural communities often miss out on opportunities to participate in today’s e-commerce marketplace, obtain advanced online education, and use new technologies that require stable high-speed internet. I am proud to say that I have fought for my constituents in rural Pennsylvania to bridge the digital divide between big cities and small-town America. I look forward to bringing greater economic opportunities to rural America through expanded access to broadband.
Tax Law Changes Affecting 529 Education Savings Plans
Three recent tax law changes made by the U.S. Treasury and IRS, under Notice 2018-58, will affect (1) tuition refunds, (2) K-12 education, and (3) Rollovers to an Able account. A change to the PATH Act adds a special rule allowing 529 plan participants to write-off tuition refunds or other qualified education expenses for tax purposes. Additionally, a new rule change allows distributions from 529 plans to be used to pay up to a total of $10,000 of tuition per beneficiary at an elementary or secondary school (K-12). Finally, funds from a beneficiary’s 529 plan can now be rolled over to an ABLE account for the same beneficiary or a family member.
Department of Justice PSA on Sexual Harassment in Housing
The Department of Justice released a public service announcement aimed to raise awareness and reach victims of sexual harassment in housing. By enlisting the assistance of victims to share their experience, the goal of the Department of Justice is to make people more aware that no one should have to choose between a home and the right to be free from sexual harassment. 
To learn more about the Justice Department’s sexual harassment initiative, visit www.fhlaw.org.
Keeping Pace with the 2020 Census 
As data gathering technology continues to improve, I’d like to inform you of some changes regarding the upcoming 2020 Census. I recently met with Joe Quartullo, Data Dissemination Specialist, from the Philadelphia Regional Office, U.S. Census Bureau as well as Lynne Newman, a Partnership Specialist for the 2020 Census. Occurring once every decade, the U.S. Census provides an unparalleled look at the demographic and socioeconomic breakdown of U.S. citizens. Under U.S. Code Title 13, The U.S. Census and American Community Survey (ACS) are mandatory; In 2020, for the first time, selected participants will be able to respond online, by phone, or by mail. Though the work of the U.S. Census Bureau is not easy, it is fundamental in tailoring policy that is reflective of a dynamic American society. 
As Always…
Please never hesitate to contact me at my offices in the district or in Washington, D.C.  I want to hear from you and learn what is most important to serve you in the best possible way.

Walker Weekly Report
Despite the rainy week, I very much enjoyed being home in North Carolina, having the opportunity to meet with constituents in Alamance, Caswell, Guilford, Person and Randolph counties to discuss how our reforms are bringing hope and opportunity to everyone in our community. 
Cutting through the noise of Washington, we are working fervently everyday to improve the lives of families in North Carolina, always remembering our promises and striving to make a difference, not just an argument. This Congress, I am proud to say we have delivered results – not rhetoric – making strides on the issues that matter to you and your family: our economy, our security, lowering the cost of living, reducing drug and health care costs, and improving education for our next generation.
Just this week, we had great economic news including that worker pay rates have now hit the highest level in a decade, we learned that healthcare costs are going down in North Carolina and we had important education legislation signed into law by the President.
Keep reading for the full update. Have a blessed week.  Sincerely, ￼ Mark Walker

HIGHLIGHTS

BCBS NC Announce Drop in Rates of Individual Plans for the First Time in More than a Quarter-Century
Last week, I told you about how we've passed multiple healthcare bills aimed at lowering health insurance premiums, expanding options and flexibility and repealing harmful Obamacare taxes like the health insurance tax that costs North Carolina families nearly $5,000 per family over a decade – as well as the medical device tax that drives up the cost of life-saving medical equipment.
This week, Blue Cross Blue Shield NC announced they are lowering insurance rates on individual plans for the first time in more than a quarter-century. Here is the percent change on BCBS exchange plans in North Carolina since Obamacare was implemented:
2014: 14.1% increase; 2015: 24.3% increase; 2016: 32.5% increase; 2017: 13.5% increase; 2018: 4.1% decrease  
We have not arrived and there is still much work to do, but we will continue working to provide you and your family with lower costs and more options in healthcare. Blue Cross specifically cited tax reform and our repeal of Obamacare's health insurance tax as reasons they were able to lower the costs for consumers.

Meeting with Piedmont Community College President and Caswell County Superintendent as the President Signs House-Passed Legislation to Close the Skills Gap into Law
This week, I was blessed to spend time in Caswell County and had the opportunity to meet with Superintendent Dr. Sandra Carter and Piedmont Community College President Dr. Pamela Senegal to learn more about the fast-track option for high school students, allowing them to earn their associate's degree by the time they graduate. Educational partnerships like this bring a brighter future to our students and helps them attain more affordable knowledge and skills, paving the way for a more prosperous life. I am thankful for the work Dr. Carter and Dr. Senegal are doing.    Important news happened this week, as the President signed the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act into law. Some of our most important industries have vacant jobs, but not enough qualified workers to fill them. With this legislation, we will help the people of North Carolina - especially young North Carolinians - get the knowledge and skills they need to enter the workforce and compete for good-paying and in-demand careers.
Because of our positive reforms, the economy is expanding and job opportunities in North Carolina are growing. In fact, across our country, there are now more job openings than job-seekers. We are working hard to close that skills gap and open the door to brighter futures for our workers.

Senate Passes ""Miscellaneous Tariff Bill"" to Save NC’s Manufacturers Millions on Unnecessary Tax Burdens and Spur Investment; Legislation Sent Back to the House
Last week, we saw more evidence of how delivering on our promise to cut taxes on hardworking families and businesses has helped our nation prosper with the announcement of 4.1 percent second quarter growth. Tariffs on imported goods are a tax on American families and businesses, especially when those tariffs are on imported materials needed for American manufacturing, but unavailable domestically. Passing the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act will help our workers continue to thrive without government intervention or the choosing of winners and losers in the economy.
The Senate-passed Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) Act of 2018 will remove harmful and useless penalties that punish manufacturers for hiring and investing in our communities.
Looking at the MTB petitions that make up the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) Act of 2018, one thing is clear, North Carolina is a big winner. The legislations consists of 1,686 petitions – American manufacturers who need to purchase materials for production that are not available in the United States. Of those 333 petitions, 19.75%, are manufacturers in North Carolina, more than any other state. That represents a savings of $71 million in 2018, also the most in the nation.
These needless taxes, which do nothing to support the production of American products, drive up production costs and ultimately the final costs of the product being manufactured. This relief will help North Carolina’s manufacturers free up their resources, hire more employees and grow overall business in our local communities.  Manufacturing represents more than one-fifth of North Carolina’s total output and employs more than 10% of the state’s workforce.

MORE GOOD NEWS ABOUT TAX REFORM
￼
""North Carolina Manufacturer Doubling Workforce, Building New Production Facility Due to Tax Reform""
Thanks to tax reform, Advanced Superabrasives of Mars Hill, North Carolina, is creating high-paying jobs, investing in workforce training and growing its operations. But what’s even more impressive is it has already given many of the 43 employees not just one, not just two, but three pay raises in 2018.
“For a small business like us, our biggest burden has always been taxes,” explained Jonathan Szucs, general manager of Advanced Superabrasives. “We would love to have had the opportunity to reinvest money in our company, in our employees and our communities—rather than give it to the government. Because of tax reform, now we finally have that opportunity.”
“We’ve handed out more raises this year than ever before in the history of our company,” Szucs said. “We’ve never done more than one raise per year—but so far in 2018, we’ve given as many as three raises to many of our employees. And we’re only halfway through the year!”
In addition to the hefty new pay bumps, Advanced Superabrasives is also using its tax savings to continue to pay 100 percent of their employees’ health care premiums—something that would have been impossible in 2018 under its old tax rate.

August 5, 2018
Dear Friend, 
The first week of the August District Work Period was eventful. In addition to meeting with constituents and participating in events around the district, I had the opportunity to speak with President Trump about my legislative priorities for the remainder of this term.  In doing so, I had the chance to reflect upon what has already been accomplished this Congress.  Since January of 2017, a total of 7 of the bills I have introduced have been signed into law.  Not all of them have passed under my name, but rather have been placed into larger bills that were deemed “must pass” by House and Senate leadership.  As Ronald Reagan said, “It is amazing what you can accomplish if you don’t care who gets the credit.” 
During this same time period, an additional 10 bills I have sponsored have passed the House (one of which also passed the Senate and is awaiting the President’s signature to become law).  These bills address tangible problems and will help people in our community and throughout our country.  The chart below outlines these 17 initiatives.  Additionally, I have also helped secure $3.5 million to dredge the Anclote River, $6.1 million to help alleviate flooding problems in Pasco, $2.7 million for much needed improvements at Baldemero Lopez Veterans Nursing home in Land O’ Lakes and $1 million to improve interagency coordination between the DoD and VA to assist those exposed to burn pit toxins.  While the practice of earmarking is banned, these are your tax dollars, and I am proud to work hard to ensure that we get our fair share of them invested into the improvement of our community.     
Became Law 
Bill Name/Issue 
Short Description 
VETERAN ACT
Modernized VA antiquated technology system 
Community CARE Act 
Reauthorized and provided funding for community health centers, at which 25 million Americans obtain their primary care, dental and mental health services.

Provided $5 million to increase the number of visa security posts in the most dangerous parts of the world
The SHUT Act 
Prevents fraud in the child tax credit program by requiring documentation of social security number or other proof of legal identification prior to distribution of funds. 
Removed cap on therapy in Medicare 
Historically, there was an annual cap of approximately $2,000 on the amount of therapy (physical, speech, occupational) a senior could use. It was insufficient to meet the needs of seniors. My language eliminated that cap. 
Passed the House 
SPACE A
Allows Veterans who are 100% disabled to use a travel benefit currently extended to active duty and retired military members and their families to travel on military aircraft when there is extra space onboard.

Please continue reading for a brief recap of my work last week.  
Protecting our Children 
It was an honor to participate in Pasco County's Safety Guard Graduation Ceremony, during which I discussed federal funding for school safety (pictured below). These men and women come from diverse backgrounds and life experiences, but share a commitment to keeping our kids safe at school. Many are retired military and law enforcement who are stepping up to serve yet again. The unique and creative partnership between the Pasco County Sheriff's Office and school district is helping keep our children safe, despite a lack of adequate funding. 
During the ceremony, I renewed my commitment to everyone in the room that I will keep fighting to secure additional federal funding for school safety. Though we've recently provided increases, large school districts still need more support. My bill, the PROTECT KIDS ACT, will help districts like Pasco, Pinellas and Hillsborough through a matching grant program. There is no greater priority than keeping our kids safe at school. 
￼ 
Ending Human Trafficking 
We kicked off the week on Monday recognizing World Day Against Trafficking In Persons. In 2013, the United Nations member states adopted a resolution which declared that such a day was necessary to “raise awareness of the situation of victims of human trafficking and for the promotion and protection of their rights.” Human trafficking is a form of modern slavery that occurs in every state, including Florida. I am proud to have voted on several human trafficking bills which have become law including the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, the Department of Homeland Security Blue Campaign Authorization Act, the No Human Trafficking on Our Roads Act, and the Combating Human Trafficking in Commercial Vehicles Act. As a result, online advertising for commercial sex trafficking has gone down by 60-80. We must continue to work together to end this horrific crime. According to the National Human Trafficking Hotline, in 2017, Florida had the third highest number of human trafficking cases in the country, with 604 cases reported. You CAN help!! If you suspect human trafficking, call the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888.
￼ 
Fighting for Veterans 
Bureaucracy is currently keeping many sick Veterans from being able to access the medical care and disability compensation benefits to which they should be entitled. It is a widely known fact that Veterans serving in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom were exposed to toxic chemicals emanating from burn pits during their deployments. The sand storms exacerbated the problem by spreading the toxins throughout a large area.  Many of these Veterans are now battling a wide range of diseases, some of which have proven fatal. I have just filed a bipartisan bill, the Protection for Veterans Burn Pit Exposure Act of 2018 (HR 6582), to correct this injustice.  My bill will help ensure these Veterans are able to access the VA medical care and disability benefits they rightfully deserve. 
At the bill’s unveiling (pictured below), I was joined by a handful of Veterans who shared heartbreaking stories about how their lives have been negatively impacted by exposure to toxins.  Two of them have been diagnosed with the same, rare terminal illness impacting the lungs. I was glad the media highlighted their struggles in these segments.  By doing so, they are helping bring attention to the fact that something must be done now.  
￼ 
However, I was extremely disappointed by the comments made by a senior VA employee in this local story about the issue.  Not only does it show a complete lack of understanding for the plight of those who were exposed to burn pit toxins, but also for the injustice that has been perpetuated against Blue Water Navy Veterans.  Our focus should be on the cost that has been incurred by these Veterans, who are sick and in some cases dying, as well as, the financial and emotional hardship their families have endured—not the cost to the system.  Congress has given the VA record increases in funding in recent years.  These dollars are to be used to help our Veterans.  The brave men and women who have been exposed to these toxins risked their lives to defend our nation.  Now, it is our job to defend them against this bureaucratic way of thinking, to remove the red tape and to ensure we honor our commitment to them by providing the medical care and benefits they have earned through their sacrifice and service.    
After Vietnam, it took the VA decades of studying the effects of Agent Orange before it made the official determination that exposure to the deadly chemical caused Veterans to get sick. This determination allowed them to access medical care and disability benefits.  In the case of the Blue Water Navy Veterans, they are still waiting.  Burn pit toxin exposure is the Agent Orange of this generation. It is a moral imperative that we learn from the mistakes in the way Agent Orange was handled. These Veterans are suffering and they need help now. I promise to keep fighting on their behalf.
Additionally, I am pleased that the VA finally broke ground last week on a project I have been working on for over seven years. Securing 136 state-of-the-art, private rooms for Pasco and Hillsborough Veterans who receive their care at this hospital has been extremely important to me. When I learned from an independent study in 2011 that this project would save the VA $500,000,000 and be more convenient for Veterans, I immediately began fighting for its approval. There were many steps involved- but it was about doing the right thing –the common sense thing for those who have bravely served our nation. However, in Washington sometimes doing something that just makes good sense can be difficult. It has been a long and arduous process to get to this point, but I would not quit, and the results are going to be worth the effort. 
Our Veterans deserve the dignity that these private rooms will offer. I have always said that they should have access to the highest quality care in the very best facilities, and today we are one step closer to making that a reality. Additionally, taxpayers are owed the good stewardship that was reflected in this decision. I will continue to seek these kind of win-win opportunities for my constituents because that is what public service is all about. This is going to be an amazing facility and I am eager for its completion.
Fostering Economic Prosperity 
Every week, I have had the opportunity to share good news about how the work we are doing to boost the economy is benefitting Americans.  This Wall Street Journal article highlights more positive news about how the American economy is working for the middle class, with workers seeing their biggest pay raises in nearly a decade. I will continue to support pro-growth policies that foster an environment in which all Americans can prosper.  Additionally, this article notes that we just added 157,000 jobs in July, with the unemployment rate slipping to 3.9%, and hourly earnings continuing to rise.  The year-over-year gain in earnings is 2.7%.  
An important element of creating a sustainable economy that benefits all Americans is the development of a skilled workforce. Last week, I was proud to attend a roundtable discussion at Tampa Bay Technical High School with President Trump, Governor Scott, Hillsborough County Superintendent Eakins and other leaders in both the education and business communities.   I have been a strong supporter of career and technical education since sponsoring legislation to create Career Academies in Florida high schools, which was signed into law in 2006. 
Today’s youth face a job market that is vastly different from the one that existed a generation ago.  Advances in technology and the growth of a global economy have dramatically changed the kinds of jobs that are available, making high-skills development vital to competing in today’s workplace. Career and technical education plays an important role in preparing students for meeting those ever-evolving challenges, which is why I was proud to support the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, which increases federal funding and updates policies related to career and technical education, something that hasn’t been done in over a decade.  President Trump signed this important bill last week while we were discussing this issue at Tampa Bay Technical High School (pictured below).     
￼  
Ensuring the Availability of Affordable Flood Insurance 
I am very relieved that the Senate overwhelmingly approved the House’s bill to extend the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) until November and that the President signed it into law last week. Now, we must work together to find long-term solutions and ensure the availability of affordable flood insurance.  As I have mentioned previously, the bill passed by the House last fall is not perfect, but it does reflect language that is significantly more helpful to Floridians than the original version of the bill.  That did not happen by chance, but rather was the culmination of hard fought negotiations among myself and a bipartisan group of delegates from states whose constituents and local economies rely upon the existence of NFIP. I look forward to working with this group as we continue negotiations with the Senate.
Additionally, last week I had the privilege of meeting with Pinellas County Property Appraiser Mike Twitty (pictured below) to get updated information about how Pinellas residents are being impacted by proposed changes to NFIP.  He has kept me well-informed throughout the past year and has given me a tremendous amount of data which has proven useful when advocating for the needs of our community.  
￼ 
Hearing from You 
I was joined by several thousand constituents during my live tele-town hall last week. I'd like to thank everyone who took the time to participate.  Constituents asked and I provided my thoughts on the following subjects: the integrity of our elections, border security, immigration, Blue Water Navy legislation, school safety, the solvency of social security, reciprocity across state lines, the Forever GI law, sanctuary cities and the opioid crisis plaguing our nation. I appreciated the opportunity to share my perspective and provide information about the work I have done on these important matters. Unfortunately, with so many callers I was not able to get to everyone's question. Please feel free to contact my office to ask your question or share your feedback. My office number is 727-232-2921. Additionally, if you do not wish to be contacted for future meetings, please contact my office and leave your name and the number you would like added to our Do Not Call Li! st.

Friends,
This week, I had the pleasure to meet with so many constituents across Northeast Ohio! Thank you to everyone who was able to make it to my district office hours on Wednesday. For those of you who could not make it, be sure to send me an email or call my office to let me know what issues are important to you.
Here are some other highlights from the week.
Perry Nuclear Plant Producing 14% of the entire State's generation capacity and 90% of Ohio's zero emissions electricity, Ohio's two nuclear plants are powerhouses of clean energy. Perry itself employs about 760 high-skilled workers. One major discussion point during the visit was the planned decommissioning of Perry and the impact a closure would have on not only the local and State communities, but on our nation's electric grid. It is valuable to see firsthand the hard work and high skill that goes into the 24/7 operation of the plant, which powers 1.7 million homes. It is my hope that we can work toward a solution to maintain the diverse Ohio energy capacity, retain these high-skilled jobs in the Buckeye state, and continue providing consumers with affordable, clean, and reliable energy to power homes and businesses. ￼
STERIS The STERIS tour, in Mentor, showcased the ""mock"" procedure rooms and available medical devices manufactured at the facility. STERIS is Lake County's largest employer and one of the many companies that has benefited from tax reform! ￼
U.S. Postal Service Fentanyl Detector I say it time and again because I see it impacting our district, friends and neighbors: the opioid epidemic is a national emergency. It is in every community and is costing the lives of our families, friends, and coworkers. Congress has passed over 70 bills addressing the epidemic, bringing resources directly to our communities for research, safety, treatment, and recovery. Our effort also included resources to combat the illegal transportation of opioids and fentanyl through our U.S. Postal Service. I visited with local law enforcement and postal inspectors and tested out a new tool that scans and detects fentanyl in packages being shipped throughout our country. Tools like this will help get this extremely dangerous drug off the streets. ￼
Cuyahoga County Airport Control Center Our nation's regional airports need significant infrastructure and transportation upgrades. The Cuyahoga County Airport tour highlighted their state-of-the-art control center and provided updates on their runway rehabilitation project. I was instrumental in securing additional funding to rebuild our nation's infrastructure for regional airports like the Cuyahoga County Airport. ￼
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative at Work On Tuesday, I joined representatives from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Great Lakes Fishery Commission, and Western Reserve Land Conservancy to tour the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) research vessel on Lake Erie, the R/V Muskie, to see first-hand how Great Lakes Restoration Initiative funding I fought so hard for is helping protect the $7 billion Great Lakes fishery and the 75,000+ jobs the fishery supports from invasive species like Asian carp. Keep up the great work! ￼
Macedonia Fire Department Receives Federal Emergency Grant Congrats to the Macedonia Fire Department on being awarded an Assistance to Firefighters Grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to better protect our firefighters and our communities! I was proud to secure additional support for this critical program last week through my service on the House Committee on Appropriations. Our brave firefighters deserve the best equipment and training available. Read more here. 
Beware of Postal Scams The past couple of years, I have been traveling all over the district with law enforcement and postal inspectors warning seniors of scam and fraud risks. This past week, I addressed seniors at the Lyndhurst Community Center about this issue. If you have questions about a possible scam, call the U.S. Postal Inspection Service at 1-877-876-2455 and select option 4. Read more about this event here.  ￼
National Federation of Independent Business Owners-Lake County Small business owners are always looking for more opportunities to expand their reach and hire more people. The members of NFIB Ohio in Lake County are no different. I had the opportunity to discuss with them the benefits of tax reform and the growing economy in Northeast Ohio. Thanks for a great conversation! ￼

News from Representative Bucshon 
￼ 
MEET LARRY     CONTACT     SERVING YOU     MEDIA     LEGISLATION     INDIANA'S 8TH 
Fellow Hoosier,

In case you missed it, July was a busy month in the House of Representatives. Here are some important Congressional actions that are important to Hoosiers like yourself. Congress is working hard to keep our promises and I want to tell you about it. Keep reading for information on my upcoming event next week!
Americans are Better Off Now
Two years ago, House Republicans unveiled the Better Way agenda. At that time, we made a promise to the American people that if we were given the chance to lead and implement this agenda, Americans would not have to accept the stagnant economic growth, stagnant wages, higher taxes, and burdensome regulations that the Obama Administration and Washington liberals told them was the future we all had to settle for.    
￼
Working with President Trump, we have put in the hard-work to fulfill our promises to the American people. We’ve been implementing our agenda by cutting taxes, rolling back burdensome regulations, and empowering consumers. As a result, our economy is once again roaring – reaching an impressive rate of growth of 4.1 percent this past quarter. While Americans are better off now as a result of our pro-growth policies, we still have more work to do to continue strengthening our economy, growing paychecks, reducing healthcare costs and helping hardworking American families get ahead.                             
￼
Improving Health Outcomes and Lowering Healhcare Costs for Hoosiers
This July, Congress took some important steps to improve healthcare and lower its cost for Hoosiers.
I supported H.R. 184, the Protect Medical Innovation Act, when it passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 283-172 on July 24. As a physician, I understand the vital importance the medical device industry plays in healthcare, and I routinely used innovative medical devices in the operating room to help save the lives of my patients. Indiana has a robust medical device industry with more than one hundred businesses employing 20,000 Hoosiers in high-paying jobs. When implemented in 2013, the job killing medical device tax caused companies in Indiana to halt investments in innovation and expansion, and ultimately to hire fewer employees.  
￼
Congress should not continue giving temporary relief from the medical device tax, but rather, fully repeal this jobs-killing tax and give much-needed certainty to this home-grown, innovative industry. Once the medical device tax is repealed, medical device manufacturers will be able to make long-term investments in expanded research and development, leading to new, innovative, and life-saving devices. Advancements in healthcare and good-paying jobs in the United States depend on this industry, and so I strongly urge my Senate colleagues to send this important bill to President Trump’s desk to be signed into law without delay.
I also supported two bills, the Increasing Access to Lower Premium Plans and Expanding Health Savings Accounts Act of 2018 (H.R. 6311) and the Restoring Access to Medication and Modernizing Health Savings Accounts Act of 2018 (H.R. 6199), when they passed the House with bipartisan support on July 25.
Obamacare’s flawed policies and regulations have left Americans stuck with health care choices that continue to climb in cost and decrease in number year after year. Americans want an off-ramp from Obamacare that will enable them to have access to affordable health care options that give individuals and families greater choice to make decisions that are best for them.
One of the ways to give Americans more affordable health care options is to expand the ability of Americans to use health savings accounts (HSAs), which allow families to set aside their money on a pre-tax basis to use for qualified health care costs. HSAs empower individuals and families to make health care decisions that best fit their needs and budget. These bills will provide more affordable health care options by making it possible for greater numbers of Americans to contribute more money to an HSA while also giving more flexibility to families and individuals on how they can spend their funds.
Supporting Our Military
On July 26, I voted to send the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019 to President Trump’s desk. One of the most important responsibilities that the Constitution specifically charges the federal government with is providing for our nation’s defense.   
￼
The NDAA is how Congress fulfills that responsibility every year, authorizing spending for our troops, weapons systems, national security programs, and military operations. To carry out the mission of protecting our freedoms and ensuring the security of our nation, our armed forces must be fully equipped and prepared. As international threats continue to rise, we must meet the rigorous demands of a fully prepared and well trained military. After years of chronic underfunding, which negatively impacted readiness and unnecessarily put the lives of our service men and women in danger, we’ve begun the slow process of rebuilding our nation’s military capacity and ensuring our troops have the training, tools, and support they need to meet the national security challenges of the 21st century.
Visiting Our Southern Border
I recently visited our southern border and toured several immigration facilities, including Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) facilities where children detained at the border, both who crossed unaccompanied and who crossed as part of a family unit, are being housed. While it is clear that much more needs to be done to secure our border, the facilities we toured along the U.S.–Mexico border are well maintained, fully supplied, and adequately staffed to take proper care of the children in their charge. Unfortunately, many of these children have crossed the border with an adult who may not be a family member, and the vast majority of these children crossed the border unaccompanied.  
￼
Visiting our southern border with fellow members of the House Committee on Energy & Commerce including Chairman Walden and Indiana's 5th district Representative, Susan Brooks.
I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to ensure families that were separated at the border are reunified in a timely manner with a process that also protects the safety of the children. I believe the best solution to the situation at hand is to pass legislation to fix our nation’s broken immigration system and truly secure our borders, strengthen our legal immigration system, keep families together, and ensure that our nation remains true to our heritage as a nation of immigrants.  Supporting Main Street  I supported the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act of 2018 on July 17 because entrepreneurs and small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. Ensuring Hoosier small businesses have access to capital to get up and running, and to reinvest as they grow, is critical to creating jobs and prosperity in our communities. The best way for legislators to help main street businesses reach their full potential is to lift regulations that are stifling job growth and limiting access to capital. We must continue to support our small businesses by building upon pro-growth policies that have led to recent economic growth.  A New Supreme Court Nominee  President Trump has nominated another immensely qualified candidate to the Supreme Court. In over a decade of service on the federal bench, Judge Brett Kavanaugh has become a well-respected judge and has amassed a strong record as a defender of the Constitution and the rule of law. While I do not have a vote in his confirmation as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, I strongly urge the United States Senate to swiftly confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.

THE LAW ENFORCEMENT CONGRESSIONAL BADGE OF BRAVERY
 
In 2008, the U.S. Congress passed legislation creating the Federal Law Enforcement Congressional Badge of Bravery and the State and Local Law Enforcement Congressional Badge of Bravery. This award honors exceptional acts of bravery in the line of duty by federal, state, and local law enforcement officers. 

This week, Congressman Mark Sanford and I presented the Badge of Bravery to some of the best in our community. 

￼

Representatives Carter and Sanford presenting the Federal Law Enforcement Congressional Badge of Bravery

On November 18, 2016, deputies from the United States Marshals Service Southern District of Georgia, and members of the Agency’s Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force, sought to locate and arrest a fugitive wanted for multiple counts of attempted murder of police officers.  The award recipients demonstrated great courage during the apprehension of the armed fugitive in Long County. Tragically, the apprehension resulted in the line-of-duty death of Pat Carothers, who was serving at the time as the Task Force Deputy Commander.  

In addition to fallen Deputy Commander Pat Carothers, we presented the award to Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Ram Suraez, Deputy U.S. Marshal James Turner, and Deputy U.S. Marshal Robert Doherty.

Thank you to these brave officers for their service to our community. 

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CLXXIII

Monday, July 30, 2018:  Every 5th Sunday is a special time for men in Effingham County as the Guyton United Methodist Church hosts the 5th Sunday Men’s Breakfast featuring a delicious meal and a message from a local speaker.  Co-founded in 1956 by Lawton Nease and Neal Ratchford, the breakfast continues on today and I was fortunate to attend this past Sunday as we heard from Effingham County Sheriff Jimmy McDuffie. 
￼
Rep. Carter participating in the annual AAA “School’s Open Drive Carefully” Awareness event and press conference
This morning, I’m at the Savannah-Chatham County Public School System (SCCPSS) Office in downtown Savannah for the annual AAA “School’s Open Drive Carefully” Awareness event and press conference.  Along with SCCPSS Superintendent Dr. Ann Levett, Police Chief Terry Enoch and Governor’s Office of Highway Safety (GOHS) Director Harris Blackwood, we take the opportunity to remind drivers that school begins later this week and we all need to slow down and pay close attention.  Afterwards, I head to our Savannah office where I meet with representatives from the Georgia Chapter of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation followed by a meeting with Evory-Aspen Scott, a young lady from Savannah who I met over a year ago and has recently completed a student study program in Germany.  After a meeting with Scott Terry with the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, I have a phone interview with the Atlanta Journal Constitution to discuss passage of legislation to extend the National Flood Insurance Program through this year’s hurricane season and hurricane preparedness.  Next, I head to Henry Plumbing in Savannah and meet with Todd and Tonya Reed to learn more about their small business and the positive impact the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has had on their business.  Afterwards, I head to Oatland Island to witness the damage they sustained from last week’s tornado.  Although significant damage was incurred, this hidden gem will not be deterred and they will bounce back.  My last visit of the day is with Frank Peeples Jr. with Peeples Industries as I tour their impressive facilities on the Savannah River and learn more about their bulk marine terminal operations.

Tuesday, July 31, 2018:  I’m at the Garden City terminal of the Georgia Ports Authority (GPA) this morning to take part in the official signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Ports, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Georgia Center of Innovation for Logistics.  GPA is one of the fastest growing ports in the country and the world because of the planning and logistics that have been invested by the Authority.  Today’s MOU will lead to continued growth and expertise development within the state.  Afterwards, I head downtown to the Savannah Civic Center where I speak to the participants of the “Connect the Dots” poverty summit being held this morning.  The summit brings together members of Savannah’s faith-based community and social organizations to talk about improving the local quality of living. 
￼
Rep. Carter at the official signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Georgia Ports Authority, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Georgia Center of Innovation for Logistics
Next, I head to River Street to tour the Savannah Riverboat Cruises and discuss tax reform with the owner, Captain Jonathan Claughton.  After a great visit and tour of the Georgia Queen, I head to Woodville Tompkins Technical and Career High School for an appreciation luncheon honoring the teachers, staff and business associates of this great facility that has been named one of the Best High Schools in the Nation for the past four years by U.S. News and World Report.  Next, I head to NLaws produce in Garden City to meet with co-founder Jay Epstein to discuss tax reform and tour the facility.  Started in 2003, this family owned business has seen tremendous growth through the years by stressing quality customer service.  Afterwards, I head to the Salvation Army Command Center in Savannah where I meet with Major Paul Egan and his staff to learn more about what this great organization does to help those in need in our community.  Finally, I head to our Savannah office where I have a telephone town hall call throughout the First District to hear from constituents and answer their questions.

Wednesday, August 1, 2018:  My day starts off in Pembroke in North Bryan County where I tour Pembroke Advanced Communications (PAC) to learn more about their business and the challenges of independent carriers.  Telecommunications falls under the jurisdiction of the Energy and Commerce (E&C) Committee that I serve on and assuring rural broadband availability is one of our primary initiatives.  Next, I head to the southern part of Bryan County to meet with members of the Richmond Hill Chamber of Commerce to discuss tax reform. 
￼
Rep. Carter presents a flag in honor of Officer Joseph Lupus to his father Sergeant Mark Lupus
Afterwards, I head to Chatham Parkway in Savannah where I meet with First District members of the Georgia Broadcasters Association to discuss their issues and challenges.  Again, as a member of the E&C Committee, this area falls under our jurisdiction and it is important for me to be familiar with their issues.  Next, I head to the Savannah Police Department headquarters on Habersham Street where I present a flag flown over the Capitol in honor of Officer Joseph Lupus to his father Sergeant Mark Lupus.  Officer Joseph Lupus recently passed while he and his father were both serving on the Savannah Police force.  Afterwards, I head to the Tomochichi Federal Courthouse where, along with fellow Congressman Mark Sanford (R-SC), I participate in presenting the Congressional Badge of Bravery to the widow of fallen Deputy Commander Patrick Carothers, and U.S. Marshalls Ramiro Suarez, Robert Doherty and James Turner.  These brave men were involved in apprehending a fugitive in Long County in 2016 when Deputy Commander Carothers was killed in the line of duty.  After this solemn ceremony, I head down to Jekyll Island where I speak to the Georgia Sheriff’s Association at their annual convention and witness my good friend Savannah Attorney Steve Scheer receive the Meritorious Service Award. 

Thursday, August 2, 2018:  I’m in Darien in McIntosh County this morning where I tour the Darien Telephone Company as part of my telecommunications tour this week. 
￼
Rep. Carter discusses tax reform at Liberty Cycle Polaris
After a great meeting with Director of Operations David Stevens and other managers, I head to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Glynn County where I have the honor of speaking at the FLETC Honor Graduate of the Year Luncheon.  This year’s honoree is National Security Agency Police Officer Shawn Mayer, who played college football at Penn State University and was a member of the 2003 Super Bowl Champion New England Patriots.  My final stop today is in Hinesville in Liberty County as I tour the Liberty Cycle Polaris dealership and meet with owners John and Ken Jenkinson to discuss tax reform and what it has meant to their small business.

￼ 


Safeguarding Wisconsin’s Election System
￼

In July, I joined my Democratic colleagues to demand the funding Wisconsin desperately needs to defend our vulnerable election system. Republican attempts to zero out funding to protect our country and our elections from Russian interference is shameful.

LEARN MORE


Funding Lead Reduction Programs 
￼

This month, my amendment to increase funding for federal lead reduction programs passed the US House of Representatives. Smart legislation like this can help ensure lead poisoning is preventable, not inevitable. We must continue to fight for these programs, especially in high-risk communities like those impacted in Milwaukee.

LEARN MORE

Protecting the Supreme Court
￼

This month, the Trump administration threatened to reverse decades of progress by nominating Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh’s confirmation threatens to create the most conservative court since Jim Crow, putting women’s, workers’, and minority civil rights on the line. We must protect the Supreme Court, so that it can protect us.

LEARN MORE


GOP Health Care Sabotage 
￼

In July, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi joined Citizen Action Wisconsin in our great city to oppose the ruthless Republican attacks on Medicare, Medicaid, and the ACA. I will continue to fight with Leader Pelosi to protect people with pre-existing conditions, lower the cost of prescription drugs, and to ensure every American their right to affordable health insurance.

LEARN MORE


Fighting Poverty, Not the Poor
￼

This month, I spoke to the Center for American Progress about my bill, the Family Poverty is Not Child Neglect Act, which would stop children being taken from their parents as punishment simply for being poor. We need a government that supports families, rather than tearing them apart.

LEARN MORE


Providing Relief to Small Businesses
￼

Small, minority-owned, and women-run investment adviser firms should be subject to regulations commensurate with their scale, so they have the resources they need to support local economic growth. This month, we got a step closer to providing that relief when my bipartisan bill, the Investment Adviser Regulatory Flexibility Improvement Act, passed the US House of Representatives.

Email Update: August 5, 2018  

Dear Lindsey, 

For this weeks newsletter, I wanted to share some of our achievements on behalf of our nation’s veterans. The last year and a half we’ve doubled down on our bipartisan efforts to transform the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). It is important for our veterans and to know that Congress and the administration is fighting for them and, while there is still work ahead, the progress made to reform VA has been remarkable. 

We’ve had over two dozen veterans bills signed into law by President Trump this Congress, and below are five key pieces of legislation that the House has passed to improve the VA:


1. VA MISSION Act: Signed into law on June 6, 2018 by President Trump, the VA MISSION Act of 2018 increases the availability for our veterans to access healthcare through coordinating care programs, gives more opportunities for walk-in appointments, and improves insurance options. To learn more about this bill, please follow this link. 

2. VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act: This bill was passed in an effort to provide more transparency and clarity within the Department of Veterans Affairs. This bill will hold the VA accountable for their actions and provide veterans with the peace of mind in knowing that they are receiving the good care that they have earned. To learn more about this bill, please follow this link. 

3. H.R. 5895: The Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act of 2018, passed in the House on June 8, 2018. This bill provides $145.4 billion dollars in funding for the Army Corps of Engineers, the VA, and military construction and family housing for the Department of Defense. To learn more about this bill, please follow this link. 

4. H.R. 4958: Each year, Social Security benefits are automatically adjusted to match inflation. Conversely, Congress must pass a new law annually for veterans' disability compensation to do the same. The Veterans Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2018 increases the disability compensation for our veterans and their survivors. To learn more about this bill, please follow this link. 

5. H.R. 3832: The opioid epidemic has had a detrimental impact on our country. In May 2018, the House unanimously passed the Veterans Opioid Abuse Prevention Act in an effort to combat the opioid crisis. This bill specifically, connects the VA to national drug monitoring databases to ensure that our veterans do not go unnoticed. To learn more about this bill, please follow this link. 


Please know that during my remaining months in office, I will continue working with all of my colleagues to advance policies and reforms that work for you. As always, if there is anything that my office can do to be of assistance to you, please do not hesitate to contact either our Troy or Washington offices. 

Thank you and best wishes.

 July in Photos 📸


July was packed full of travel, events, and announcements—here are a few photo highlights from the month.
￼

I enjoyed a visit to Goodwill of Central Texas in Austin, where I learned more about their partnership with Google to develop the new Digital Career Accelerator program. 

￼
Judge Brett Kavanaugh stopped by to discuss his nomination to be an associate justice on the Supreme Court.

￼
In Houston, Congressmen Olson and Culberson joined me for a discussion with federal, state, and local officials about funding we helped secure for flood control projects to protect the region.

￼
Texas has led the nation in exports since 2002, and our largest export market is Mexico. I spent some time talking US-Mexico trade and the importance of NAFTA with Ambassador Geronimo Gutierrez and other Mexican officials. 

￼
I enjoyed the opportunity to speak about the threats posed by Hezbollah, Hamas, and Iran as well as the conflict in Syria at this year's Christians United for Israel Summit.

￼
Back in Texas, I was honored to spend time with some of our veterans at the annual convention of the Texas Department of the American Legion and discuss the recently enacted VA Mission Act to modernize the veterans appeal process, reform GI Bill benefits, and improve the VA’s accountability.

￼
And finally, I helped welcome a new member to the Texas congressional delegation in DC this month, Representative Michael Cloud. 
The Senate will remain in session during August, and I look forward to updating you on more work soon.

Addressing the Relocation of LPG Storage Facilities
￼ 
Dear Lindsey, 

In our community of San Pedro, there is a Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) storage facility next to a park where children play and near family homes. These storage tanks contain millions of gallons of highly combustible fuel and don’t belong in our neighborhoods. 

Last week, I introduced a bill that would provide $500 million for the relocation of the San Pedro LPG facility and similar sites away from homes, schools, and other sensitive locations. Residents that live near these facilities have dealt with this issue for far too long and we can’t continue to ignore their existence. 

Please find some weekly highlights below.

In Community,

Engaging with Youth at the Watts/Willowbrook Boys & Girls Club
￼ 
The Watts/Willowbrook Boys & Girls Club is a beacon of hope for youth in our district. I am thankful for the opportunity to have visited this past Monday and provide students with advice on how to keep our community engaged on local and national issues. These youth are the future leaders of our community and the Boys & Girls Club is preparing them to be successful.  

Visiting the Children's Institute in Watts
￼ 
On Tuesday, I toured the Children’s Institute Inc. center in Watts - a place of caring, hope, and transformative change for children and families affected by violence. Thank you for providing early childhood education, mental health services, and your work on collaborating with local stakeholders and organizations to strengthen our Watts community. 

Touring the Jordan Downs Redevelopment Site
￼ 
I recently toured Phase 1 of the Jordan Downs Redevelopment Project in Watts. This project will provide 9 acres of public parks and open space, a 160,000 square foot shopping center with businesses that will employ hundreds of local residents, and housing to 1,400 families in the community. I appreciate the leadership of the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles and Bridge Housing on this project, as well as the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco for the Affordable Housing Program Grant awarded to Jordan Downs.  

Visiting Western Tube, A Successful Supplier of Steel and Aluminum
￼ 
Western Tube & Conduit Corporation, a division of Zekelman Industries, is one of our nation’s largest steel pipe and tube producing companies, and located right here in our district! I am so thankful for the job opportunities they provide for men and women living in our district, and employing generations of families.

August 4, 2018
Greetings,
On Wednesday, I voted to pass the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019. I am proud to have secured over 30 provisions that will ensure the continued success of Texas’ military communities and address the United States’ national security interests. In the challenging and threatening environment that we live in today, it is imperative that we have a strong, well-funded military to effectively achieve peace. Though no reward can truly match the sacrifices made by our troops, this bill includes a well-deserved increase to our troops’ take-home pay. With unified Republican leadership, the Senate has once again been able to fulfill our first responsibility, which is equipping our servicemen and women and ensuring the defense of this nation.
Last year, Congress passed historic tax cuts which are expanding opportunity and allowing hardworking men and women to rightfully keep more of their hard-earned money in their pockets. As a result, millions of Americans have seen well-deserved, significant tax relief. However, charities, churches, and other tax-exempt organizations have been required to pay federal taxes on employee fringe benefits. On Wednesday, I introduced the Protect Charities and Houses of Worship Act, which would repeal a mandate requiring traditionally tax-exempt organizations like churches and charities to pay these taxes to the federal government and instead allow them to fulfill their intended purpose of helping people and the community. 
This week, as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Space, Science, and Competitiveness, I chaired the second in a series of hearings that will lead toward the introduction of new legislation. This legislative effort will look to provide continued support for core programs at NASA, the Johnson Space Center, and our growing space sector in Texas. The hearing focused on the search for life beyond Earth, and ensures that we equip NASA with the capabilities that it needs to support science missions and priorities that will lead to discoveries across our solar system. America’s leadership in space continues to receive broad, bipartisan support in Congress. I am grateful that this week my colleagues in the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation passed the Cruz-Nelson-Markey Space Frontier Act, which supports the continued development of a robust commercial space sector, among other items. On Friday, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and I visited Houston’s Johnson Space Center for NASA’s announcement naming the astronauts assigned to crew the first test flights and maiden voyages of the Boeing CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX Crew Dragon. Texas continues to lead the way for America’s manned exploration of space and this announcement marks a new era of discovery.
As we continue to rebuild from the unprecedented devastation from Hurricane Harvey, we must also take all steps necessary to prepare for the hurricane season ahead. For those seeking information or assistance during the recovery and rebuilding process, please do not hesitate to contact my office or use the federal and state resources listed here. For those seeking preparedness information and resources, please refer to the federal and state resources listed here.

Congressman Smith's E-news: August 4, 2018 
 ￼  Last week we said farewell to our summer intern, Sara, with the Congressional Internship Program for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities. Arranged by the Committee on House Administration, of which I am a member, and George Mason University, this internship program allows young people with intellectual disabilities to learn about Congress and build job skills by spending time in congressional offices and helping with administrative tasks.   
Reducing Unnecessary Senior Hospitalization 
Caring for the elderly and disabled among us is one of our most sacred responsibilities. Many of us have family or friends living in skilled nursing facilities and we want them to have access to the best care available in the event of an emergency.   Unfortunately, this is not always the case. Despite the availability of new technologies and qualified medical professionals in nursing facilities, seniors and the disabled across our country are frequently transported to hospital emergency rooms to receive emergency care. In fact, around 19 percent of hospital transfers come from skilled nursing facilities and one in five of those discharged after treatment will have to return yet again for a follow up visit.  This needs to change. I introduced the Reducing Unnecessary Senior Hospitalization (RUSH) Act to bring much-needed innovation to these facilities and the Medicare program as a whole. The RUSH Act would allow the use of technologies such as telehealth in skilled nursing facilities to treat patients in place rather than transferring them to the hospital.   Telehealth gives medical professionals and first responders like those already working in skilled nursing facilities access to doctors who can provide immediate consultation in emergency situations. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) found that 45 percent of hospital admissions from these facilities could have been avoided with such an arrangement. This would not only save a great deal of money, but also prevent Medicare beneficiaries from being unnecessarily exposed to health risks such as falls, delirium, infections, and adverse medication interactions.   At present, however, Medicare is unable to reimburse skilled nursing facilities for the cost of telehealth providers. The RUSH Act would address this problem by allowing Medicare to make arrangements with medical providers to allow acute care at skilled nursing facilities using a combination of telehealth and on-site first responders.   Treating patients in place with the aid of an emergency physician represents a three-way win: patients are not subjected to traumatic, rushed trips to the emergency room unless absolutely necessary, emergency rooms are less congested and thus enabled to more swiftly treat those in need, and the American taxpayer bears a lower cost to maintain the Medicare program.    This innovative, 21st century care model is long overdue. The RUSH Act would significantly decrease emergency room visits and improve quality of life at skilled nursing facilities across the country. I look forward to the implementation of this and many other great ideas which will improve the Medicare program and help us to keep our promises to seniors.   Tax Reform Roundtables 
This week I announced a series of small business roundtables to provide an opportunity for small business owners, including farmers and ranchers, to share their opinions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and how to further improve the tax code. As a member of the House Committee on Ways and Means which has jurisdiction over tax legislation, I take pride in representing the concerns of Nebraskans in such discussions.   Tax reform roundtables will be held at the following times and locations:  Monday, August 13  Weborg 21 Centre 2625 10th Street, Gering 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. MDT  Wednesday, August 15  Central Community College, Room 131 1215 30th Avenue, Kearney 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. CDT  Thursday, August 30  Nebraska State Fair Nebraska Building, Second Floor Board Room 501 E Fonner Park Road, Grand Island 12:00 p.m to 1:00 p.m. CDT  
My Schedule Next Week
Next week I will be holding public events in Sidney, Thedford, Cozad, Ravenna, Grand Island, and Beatrice. Among them will be mobile offices, at which residents of the Third District can speak with me about current issues such as trade, the Farm Bill, and tax reform, and Excellence in Economic Development award presentations, which the public is also welcome to attend.   The purpose of the Excellence in Economic Development program is to recognize local individuals and businesses who help to strengthen Nebraska communities through innovation, hard work, entrepreneurship, and historic preservation.  
Monday, August 6  Cheyenne County Mobile Office  Cheyenne County Chamber of Commerce 740 Illinois Street, Sidney 10:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. MDT   Tuesday, August 7  Thomas County Mobile Office Thedford Life Center 507 Walnut Street Thedford 12:00 p.m. to 1:00 p.m. CDT

Dear Friend,
America, in her earliest days, was founded as a safe haven for religious people. After our founding fathers fought a revolution and established this liberty, many Europeans fled persecution of their faiths and suffered a long, perilous pilgrimage to America to find free land. A land of people united in establishing a country unlike any other seen before, a union of free states governed by people with the freedom to live according to their own individual conscience and religious beliefs...KEEP READING HERE


WHAT'S GREAT IN THE 8TH

￼
Jackson Egg Company was recently started by childhood friends who grew up on family farms in Jackson. Adam Birk and his grandfather Glen were kind enough to show me around the farm and share some ideas on eliminating barriers for young farmers getting started. Congressman Bill Emerson visited Glen on his first farm tour stop, how neat is that?
￼
Dave Steinbecker Jr. of Steinbecker Livestock has quite the impressive operation in Perryville. He recently started growing cover crops and using monoslope barns to increase soil and water quality, and his family farm was the winner of the prestigious BEEF Magazine Stocker Award for excellence and innovation in the cattle industry.
￼
Lane Falch brought 11 sheep with him to the St. Francois County Fair this year, winning him first in several categories and he took home the Junior Sheep Showmanship Award! This was one of many events for Lane this year, he's taken his sheep to national competitions in Indiana and Ohio. Congratulations! 
￼
It's not every day you get to drive a mule, let alone a Missouri State Fair champion! I appreciate Dale and Carol Moreland sharing with me what sets Moreland's Mules apart and taking me for a ride on their mules Tom and Jerry. 
￼

Mike Graham has a simple message to his agriculture students in Farmington: “Don’t ever cuss a farmer with your mouth full. You should appreciate the fact that there’s a handful of people — less than 2 percent of the population in the United States — who feed all of us.”

Mike and his wife Kendra have devoted their lives to telling others the importance of agriculture to Missouri and the entire world. Agriculture touches us all, the Grahams say.

THE SCALISE CAPITOL REPORT
To begin my report this week, I'd like to again ask if you will take a moment to tell me how I'm doing in Congress and how the policies we've passed have impacted your life. To provide feedback, please visit this link and share your thoughts. Thank you!  National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) Extended to November 30 This week, the Senate passed the NFIP extension. I applaud the Senate’s quick action to pass the NFIP extension bill that the House passed last week, and appreciate the strong efforts by Senators Cassidy and Kennedy to expedite passage of this bill that will prevent a lapse in the flood insurance program and extend NFIP through the remainder of hurricane season.
Millions of families and small businesses across the country rely on the flood insurance program. While this extension is necessary to prevent a lapse in the program, I will continue to fight for a long-term reauthorization of the NFIP that includes much-needed reforms to the program. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in both the House and Senate to come to an agreement that provides long-term certainty to policyholders and taxpayers.
Standing Up for Religious Freedom
Last Friday, I led 84 of my House colleagues and Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) led 23 of his Senate colleagues in filing an amicus brief to stand up for religious freedom and the memory-of and tributes-to our fallen soldiers. 

The American Humanist Association filed suit to remove a 90-year-old war memorial built by the American Legion honoring 49 soldiers from Prince George’s County, Maryland, who lost their lives in World War I. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the American Legion, and now the American Legion, with our support in Congress, has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review and reverse this decision.

I’m proud to lead the fight in the House in support of this  appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court that honors the religious tradition of our nation, protects memorials and monuments across the country that incorporate religious symbols, and seeks to clarify court rulings that misinterpret the true meaning of the separation of church and state. We must protect our national memorials to those who have given their all in support of our country and acknowledge the role that religion plays in American life. For 90 years, this cross has stood to honor 49 brave soldiers who gave the ultimate sacrifice to our country in World War I, and it’s incumbent upon us to make sure their memory and legacy is protected and defended at all costs.

Bevolo Visits the White House
Last week, President Trump held his Made in America summit and hosted Bevolo, a historic Louisiana family business, to showcase some of what Louisiana has to offer. Bevolo makes classic New Orleans style lighting fixtures and has operated in New Orleans since 1945. It was great to visit with the Bevolo team last week and congratulate them in person!

It is an honor to represent you in Congress. For more information please visit my website, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook pages.

Friend-  The people's House accomplished a great deal of work this July. We passed landmark legislation to improve career and technical education programs. We passed a defense bill that provides the authorities and resources for our men and women of the Armed Forces to do the job we've asked them to do. We also passed a series of bills targeted at lowering healthcare costs – specifically the cost of medication and premiums.
To see more of what I was up to this month, check it out below!

￼

I was honored to receive the Transparency and Accountability Democracy Award from the Congressional Management Foundation! My number one priority is listening to the people I represent and using their thoughts, concerns, and insights to better represent them in Washington.
 
￼
I stopped by Carepac Pharmacy in Mechanicsville to talk with folks about solutions to the rising cost of premiums and prescription drug prices. I am still focused on fighting for  a health care system where doctors and patients can be in control of their own health care decisions and everyday American families have the option to see a doctor of their choice. 
￼
I enjoyed spending the Fourth of July traveling across the First District, celebrating the gift of liberty, and talking with constituents about the latest happenings in Washington.  
￼

I visited with Minuteman Press in Ashland to hear how their business has benefited from the work Congress has done to bring our our booming economy. 

￼
I enjoyed visiting the Hanover Regional Governor's School for Career and Technical Advancement to see how our students are developing tangible skill sets to succeed in the workforce. 
￼
I spoke with American Enterprise Institute about how our Navy does not consistently receive the predictable funding it truly needs nor does it have the requisite ships to meet global demand. This proves that now more than ever we must reach a fleet of 355 ships to meet global demand. 
￼
I toured Trivett’s Furniture in Fredericksburg and spoke with folks about how Congress is working to get government out of the way so small businesses can succeed. 
￼
I toured the Pamunkey Regional Jail in Hanover with the McShin Foundation. I’m grateful for their work to assist folks struggling with addiction and I enjoyed our conversation about criminal justice reform and Congress’ continued work to combat the opioid epidemic.

...Not Washington's.  The 24-hour news is consistently negative. Even though they’re not reporting on the good news, I have been working hard on the issues that matter to you and your family.  We’ve made real progress in Congress to help the people of the 2nd District.
We’ve made real progress: 
	•	Supporting U.S. Energy 
	•	Lowering Taxes 
	•	Improving Health Care 
	•	Growing the Economy  
	•	Cutting Red Tape 
	•	Improving Vets’ Care 
	•	Rebuilding the Military 
	•	Reforming Immigration  
￼
 
As a Member of the Energy & Commerce Committee:
	•	Extended critical programs our communities rely on, including the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for 10 years—the longest and most generous reauthorization in the program’s history – and Community Health Centers for two years.
	•	Passed the most ambitious congressional package ever to combat the opioid crisis – H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act – and other opioids-related legislation to promote treatment and recovery, encourage prevention, protect communities, and fight fentanyl. This is the most comprehensive effort to battle opioid addiction to date.
	•	Passed several bills to modernize our energy infrastructure, including my bill, H.R. 2883, the Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act, and others dealing with issues such as pipelines, hydropower, nuclear waste storage, drinking water modernization, and more.
	•	Gave patients hope by passing  S. 292, the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research (STAR) Act, the most comprehensive childhood cancer legislation ever taken up by Congress, and one of my priorities, the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity (RACE) for Children Act, was signed into law. The RACE for Children Act ensures that lifesaving treatments are available to children battling cancer.
	•	Passed H.R. 2430, the FDA Reauthorization Act (FDARA), which will help lower the cost of important medication and devices and expedites the process for approving new treatments and cures for patients and my bill, H.R. 5554, Animal Drug and Animal Generic Drug User Fee (ADUFA/AGDUFA) Amendments.
	•	Passed H.R. 3917 to extend funding for the Indian Health Service’s Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI), the Indian employment tax credit, and accelerated depreciation for business property on Indian reservations as a part of the budget agreement signed into law by President Trump.
￼

	•	26 out of 26 Counties in the 2nd District Visited
	•	200+ Bills Sponsored or Co-Sponsored 
	•	Helped 2,000+ OK-2 Residents Get Answers From Federal Agencies
	•	2,600+ Oklahomans Went on Tours in D.C. Arranged by My Office
	•	14,000+ Pieces of Correspondence Sent to OK-2 Residents
￼

Too many Americans feel that their voice doesn't matter anymore, that they're left out and locked out of their own democracy. That's why I introduced the By the People Resolution (H. Res. 975), a robust framework of democracy reforms that will:

Hultgren to Host Districtwide Town Hall Meetings
I am always grateful for the opportunity to hear from my constituents. I regularly host coffees, forums on policy issues, and meetings throughout the district.

While I am back in the District for the August recess, I will be holding a series of Town Hall meetings. I am looking forward to continue connecting with my constituents. I always say that the best solutions I bring to Washington come directly from the residents of the 14th District. 
I invite everyone who lives in the District to visit my website and sign-up for one of my upcoming Town Hall meetings. And for those that cannot make it out to a Town Hall in person, I invite you to join me from the comfort of your home for an E-Town Hall.

McHenry County Fair Proves to be Great Place to Connect with Constituents
￼ 
The McHenry County Fair is a 70 year tradition held annually in Woodstock. At the fair you can see 4-H, livestock shows, conservation and agriculture displays, a carnival, and more. The fair offers so many opportunities to come and make summertime memories.
In addition to fun, there is so much great information to be found at the fair – including at my booth in Vendor Building D. Throughout the week and into this weekend, you can stop by and chat with my staff or me about the services that we offer through my offices. Constituent Services is such an important part of what I do as your Congressman, so if you are having issues with a federal agency, planning a trip to D.C., looking for a Service Academy Nomination, would like an American Flag flown over the Capitol or have other needs, please stop by!

Hultgren Talks Proper Prescription Disposal
￼ 
Click the picture above to watch some of Congressman Hultgren's remarks 
I want to thank Walgreens for the important work they are doing to get highly addictive medications out of the home and disposed of correctly. It is so important to have a place to properly dispose of these drugs. How often do we let old prescriptions sit in our medicine cabinets, oftentimes past the point where we still need them? How frequently do we even forget what the prescription was originally for? Many may just throw them in the garbage where they sit in landfills or worse, flush them down the toilet where they pollute our drinking water. Both of which is bad for the environment.
By having a convenient and safe method of disposal we can do our part to ensure that medications are not falling into the wrong hands. Opioid misuse is an ever-growing issue and I have made combating drug addiction in northern Illinois a top priority. Bringing attention to this epidemic takes a multifaceted approach to identify our challenges as a community and to come together on solutions to this devastating problem.
This past spring I hosted the U.S. Surgeon General at a Community Leadership Forum where we had a discussion on addiction. I have also convened meetings with local emergency first responders, health care leaders and providers as well as state and local government officials, and released a Community Action Plan to Combat Heroin and Opioid Abuse. In addition to this community approach, I have been a fervent supporter of legislation to tackle this issue head-on. I voted in favor of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, the Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act, the THRIVE Act to provide transitional housing for individuals in recovery, and just this past June, H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, a bipartisan legislation package to combat the opioid crisis.
￼ 

Rush Medical Center Works to Combat Opioid Abuse with Alternative Pain Management
￼ 
This past week I was invited to come out to Rush Surgery Center to learn more about how their doctors are dealing with pain management breakthroughs and treatment. I started out my visit by changing in to surgical scrubs and observing an interventional pain surgical procedure which is used to treat chronic pain. 
After the procedure, I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the patients who rely on these and other breakthrough procedures for their pain management. 
Members of the staff at Rush are nationally recognized for their advanced work on technologies to treat painful medical conditions with minimal opioids. With the ever growing issue of opioid misuse, I am so grateful to medical centers like this one that treat people throughout Illinois, including here in the 14th District, while using alternative forms of treatment rather than relying solely on opioids. 
￼ 

Hultgren Addresses Stakeholders at DOE Hydrogen Consortium Kick-Off
￼ 
I was thankful for the opportunity to address stakeholders at the U.S. Department of Energy H2@ Scale Consortium Kick-Off Meeting. As a member of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, I recognize the need to be discussing bipartisan solutions to reduce human impact on the planet and explore alternative fuel sources to preserve our environment for future generations.
The Department of Energy continues ground breaking work to bring our next generation of cleaners and more reliable energy sources online to compete.  Hydrogen is an important part of this mix, and I look forward to continue working with the H2@ Scale Consortium as they generate great ideas that I can help take back to DC.

Congressional Report

Dear Friends, 
This week in Washington, D.C. I met with various individuals and organizations including Members of the British Parliament who participated in the British American Parliamentary Group (BAPG) exchange program. I also helped pass a bill alongside Rep. Castro to improve utility service infrastructure for San Antonio and the military community.

In the district, my staff attended various events including the Access to Capital event in Laredo. My staff also met with representatives from different agencies including the Mexican and Americans Thinking Together (MATT) Foundation and the U.S. Census Bureau.

Lastly, I have included a video from the Texas Department of Transportation that addresses back to school safety.

As always, please contact one of my offices if you need any assistance with any federal agency.

Home     Serving You     Contact     District     Legislation     Newsroom     About Bob 
Friends, 
Over the last few weeks, Congress has been working on legislation to improve our nation's healthcare system, provide resources for our military, and strengthen the U.S. intelligence community. In addition, several bills that I've authored have passed the House floor. These bills would expand access to rural broadband and increase innovation for over-the-counter products. I talk more about these important pieces of legislation below.  As the August work period begins, I look forward to talking to and hearing from constituents around Ohio's 5th Congressional District. Listening to the people I represent ensures I can better represent them in our nation's capital. 
Here's an update on recent happenings:
In Congress
Improving Broadband Access Critical to America’s Rural Communities
Recently, I raised the importance of expanding access to high-speed Internet for rural communities at an Energy and Commerce Subcommittee hearing. You can watch the video here. Though steps have been taken to improve connectivity in rural areas, there is still more that can be done to further close the ‘Digital Divide.’ 
In fact, the U.S. House of Representatives just passed my legislation, the Precision Agriculture Connectivity Act, to improve access to high-speed broadband. Our farmers are increasingly using technology to do their job in a more efficient, sustainable way. However, if they can't connect, then they aren't able to use this cutting-edge innovation. We need ensure those in our rural areas aren't left behind.  
Protecting Our Great Lakes, Saving for Our Children's Future 
I recently voted to pass H.R.6147, legislation consisting of two of the twelve appropriations bills that need to be passed each year. The bill includes a number of policies I support.   One of the most important provisions in the bill was full funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) to protect Lake Erie and the other Great Lakes. The GLRI funds a number of projects in the region, and I've long supported ensuring the program has the resources necessary to continue it's great work.   H.R. 6147 also creates a Fund for America’s Kids and Grandkids, an account where money is saved for future generations and is not accessible until the budget deficit is erased. As a supporter of a Balanced Budget Amendment, it makes sense to set aside money until the government gets its fiscal house in order.  The bill also funds the High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program which will help combat the opioid epidemic and includes a number of pro-life provisions.  
Stopping the Rise of Drugged Driving
According to a 2016 Governors Highway Association report, the number of fatalities from accidents where drivers had drugs in their systems surpassed the number of fatalities from alcohol-only accidents. Ohio alone has seen an increase in drugged driving accidents, with a 25 percent increase in accidents from 2012 to 2016.  Amid the devastating opioid crisis, tackling this problem is now more important than ever. 
As Chairman of the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee, I held a subcommittee hearing on this topic and raised concerns about the rise of drugged driving accidents and possible solutions to understanding and addressing this problem. This issue is complex, but understanding the problem is an important first step to fixing it. 
 Aspiring Journalist in Washington 
It was a pleasure talking with Taylor Legall, a student at Southview High School in Sylvania, who was in DC as a National Youth Correspondent at the Washington Journalism and Media Conference. It’s always great to see young people who are interested in journalism. Way to go, Taylor!

Around the District
Economy Continues to Soar 
The last couple of weeks have seen a number of releases from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) about our economy and how things are going. The pro-growth polices I've supported in Congress are paying off.  For instance, did you know our economy grew 4.1% in the 2nd quarter? That's the fastest rate of GDP growth in four years. Even better, wages and benefits grew at 2.8% for the quarter, the most they've grown in a DECADE. The unemployment rate continues to stay very low and unemployment claims are the lowest they've been in nearly 50 years.   Ohioans are benefiting from our current economy and jobs bills passed in Congress. For instance, a study from the Tax Foundation found that more than 8,000 new jobs in the Buckeye State have been created due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. When you allow Americans to keep more of their money, the economy soars. It's that simple. 
 
Ohio is Leading the Way on Technology 
I had the privilege of joining my fellow members of the Ohio delegation to discuss the need for the Department of Transportation to designate Ohio’s Transportation Research Center (TRC) as an autonomous vehicle (AV) testing ground. The Transportation Research Center is just south of my district in East Liberty, but it's important for the whole region.  Unfortunately, the Department of Transportation under the Obama Administration did not include TRC as one of the 10 approved AV testing sites -- an egregious oversight. 
TRC is a tremendous facility and just broke ground on a new SMARTCenter which will be the largest AV testing facility in the world. By designating it an AV testing ground, we can ensure that this innovation -- and the good-paying jobs it creates -- will continue to flourish here at home.

Wood County Fair Pork Sandwiches 
Speaking of technology, I recently did a podcast with Bloomberg on a number of my pro-innovation initiatives in Congress. That includes legislation I've authored to create a framework for self-driving car development, a bill to evaluate the impact of the Internet of Things, and efforts I've made to expand access to rural broadband.   However, the interview started off about talking about something a little different -- pork sandwiches at the Wood County Fair! I've helped out the stand for a number of years and this August was no different. You can listen to me talk about the delicious Pork-a-Lean sandwiches here.   
A Day in Henry County  To start out the August work period, I made a number of stops in Napoleon. I started the day with the Henry County Commissioners where we talked about our nation's cybersecurity efforts -- an issue very important to me. Then, I stopped by Custom Agri Systems to get an up close look at their facilities. I then joined Napoleon Mayor Maassel for a tour of the city's water building which was just massively upgraded and modernized -- an important development for the community.  After that, I toured the new Henry County Senior Center where they are providing a number of services for seniors in the area. Thank you to Sandy Blackwood for the tour. Finally, I stopped by WNDH and the Northwest Signal to give an update on what we're working on in Congress.   
￼
Wages and benefits in the 2nd quarter grew at the fastest rate in a decade

Building a Workforce for the Modern Economy  For the first time in our history, the amount of available jobs is greater than the number of people looking for employment. Right now, there are 6.7 million open jobs with 6.4 million Americans looking for work. This is great news, but it also underscores the need for Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs that prepare students for good-paying jobs in the modern economy. Allowing local stakeholders and the states to develop the best plans for their area will better ensure that we are building a workforce that has the tools needed to compete for these jobs and succeed in them.  I joined my colleagues in passing H.R. 2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, to revamp job training and career education programs. The bill updates the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, which had not been reformed since 2006.   The bill makes makes a number of key reforms to career and technical education by: 
	•	Easing burdensome requirements on state and local governments by streamlining the application process for CTE programs
	•	Increasing flexibility and allows for more funding to be set aside for rural areas or communities with high numbers of CTE students
	•	Encouraging better partnerships with employers and local business leaders
	•	Improving transparency and accountability by streamlining performance measures to ensure students graduate prepared to compete for good-paying jobs
	•	Reducing the Federal role in the programs and putting more decision-making in the hands of local stakeholders, overseen by state leaders
As a member of the House Career and Technical Education Caucus it was time to get something done on this issue. The bill was signed by President Trump this week and promises to make a big difference in developing a workforce that can succeed in the modern economy.  
Fixing Health Care: Lower Costs and More Options for Ohioans  
I continue to hear from Ohioans who feel that a one-size-fits-all system often leaves them with very few options when it comes to their health care. Even worse, less choice often means high costs for patients. It’s time to start giving patients more options and better care at lowers costs. That means reducing roadblocks that harm cutting-edge innovation and consumer choice. Whether it’s over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, medical devices, or access to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), I’m working to give Ohio families more options when it comes to their health care.  
For instance, I voted for legislation recently to suspend the Health Insurance Tax. This Obamacare tax raises premiums by 2.5% according to the Congressional Budget Office. I also voted to delay the Medical Device Tax, another Obamacare tax that stifles the innovation of life-saving and life-improving products.  HSAs are accounts that allow Americans more flexibility and choices when making their health care decision and have soared in popularity in recent years. Nearly 22 million people have HSA accounts -- more than double the 10.6 million enrolled in Obamacare exchanges. Despite this fact, there is much that can be done to make HSAs easier to use.  I joined my colleagues in passing H.R. 6311, the Increasing Access to Lower Premium Plans and Expanding Health Savings Account Act, which allows seniors with HSA-eligible coverage that are enrolled in Medicare Part A to contribute to an HSA. I actually authored legislation to fix this problem recently after hearing from constituents and was glad to see this provision included. In doing so, we’re providing working seniors more options by allowing them to stay on an employer-sponsored plan if they choose.   I also voted to pass H.R. 6199, the Restoring Access to Medication and Modernizing Health Savings Account Act, making it easier for Americans to use their HSAs and reduce the burden of high health care costs. This bill would provide more flexibility for plans to cover high-value, low-cost services without a deductible, while also allowing the use of HSAs to pay for over-the-counter products without needing to obtain a prescription.

Weekly Review
 

July 31

Endangered Salmon and Fisheries Predation Prevention Act Vote: Under the category of catching up with votes, before we headed home to respective districts the House voted on H.R. 2083, which is a bill that would allow nearly a thousand sea lions to be taken (or killed) each year in the Columbia River system in order to better protect the endangered salmon population.
The bill creates a special carve-out from existing law for the salmon on the Columbia River, and doing so is at odds with the idea of equal application of the law.
It strikes me that we could have remedied this concern by doing one of two things:
One, the bill could have been made generally applicable to all river systems feeding the Pacific from our Western states, rather than one.
Two, state governments could have come up with more local remedies that would have prevented the federal government from stepping in and taking over what has historically been the jurisdiction of state departments of natural resources. Click here to read more.

 Reps. Sanford, Carter honoring US Marshals

Congressional Badge of Bravery: Today was a reminder for me of the risks taken, bravery shown and extraordinary service performed by so many in law enforcement roles across our country.
I say this because Buddy Carter, Congressman from the First District of Georgia, asked me to join him in an award ceremony for US Marshals who performed extraordinarily on November 18, 2016. Three of the awards were for living marshals; one award was posthumously given for Commander Carothers in the events that unfolded on that fateful night of 2016.
Long story short, these members of a southeast regional fugitive task force located and sought arrest of a fugitive wanted for multiple counts of attempted murder of police officers. The fugitive in question had shot at officers in Sumter County, SC and had ultimately fled to Allenhurst, Georgia.
The team had found the fugitive in a trailer park there, cleared the area, and when they attempted to enter the trailer in question, the fugitive opened fire on the team. There Deputy Commander Patrick Carothers was mortally wounded, but his shots, even while shot, saved others on his team.
All four team members were there today as was the widow of Commander Carothers. I was there in particular because Jimmy Turner was one of those four US Marshals assigned to Savannah – though he lives in Bluffton, which is in the southern end of the First District of South Carolina. Click here to read more.

Proposed Tri-County Waterfront Park: I write to ask for your help and involvement. If not yours, I ask for that of your friends in something that could make a profound difference in the livability of the Charleston metro area.
The Tri-County Waterfront Park.
It could consist of the 400-acres between the Daniel Island development and the tip of Daniel Island. The Port Authority owns 1,300 acres, and by carving off this portion of the long run, we could have a park of scale just as all the great cities around the world do. I find it fascinating that in the 1860s when the 1,017 acres that make up the Golden Gate Park in San Francisco were set aside, they recognized “the need for a spacious park similar to Central Park due to urbanization and crowding.”
Those things are happening here in the Lowcountry, as 50 people a day move into the tri-county area. Click here to read more.

Dear Friend,  Since my time in law enforcement, my career has been dedicated to protecting, strengthening, and creating opportunities for our children. It was a true honor to join the ranks of First Lady Michelle Obama, Senator Edward Kennedy, and Senator Orrin Hatch when I received the prestigious Excellence in Public Service Award from the American Academy of Pediatrics for the work I have done to further children’s health care. This includes establishing the Children’s Health Care Caucus and co-chairing the Global Health Caucus, sponsoring bills critical to the health and development of children worldwide, such as the Reach Every Mother and Child Act and the READ Act, as well as legislation I have ushered into law such as the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act and the Family First Prevention Services Act. It has been my privilege to advocate on behalf of children in our community and around the world. 
￼

It has been a privilege working with them on legislative efforts to address our nation’s homelessness, provide access to affordable health care, and reform our immigration system. 
￼
Encouraging Our New Leaders  It was a privilege to talk with law enforcement officers in training at the U.S. Citizen and Leadership Immigration Retreat. I shared some memories from my time in law enforcement with them and the important values of leadership I strongly believe in and live by. 
￼

Dear Lindsey, 
The past couple of weeks on Capitol Hill have proven to be very busy, but I wanted to take the time to give you all an update on the recent work in Washington, D.C. and the 15th District of Texas. 
It is an honor to serve as your congressman.
On Friday, July 20, 2018, I led a congressional delegation (pictured below) at the U.S. Federal Courthouse in McAllen, Texas, to discuss the current state of border crossing proceedings with Federal Public Defender, Azalea Aleman-Bendiks. I will work with Members of Congress to approach the immigration crisis on the U.S.-Mexico Border with sound judgment and an understanding of the context, not snap decisions.
￼ 
On Friday, July 20, 2018, I visited the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Disaster Recovery Center (DRC) 3, in McAllen, Texas (first picture), to view the facility and urge Hidalgo County residents to seek out available assistance, following historic severe storms and flooding. This is what America is about – lending a helping hand in times of need.

Recently, I spoke on the House Floor to condemn the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) over reports of the mistreatment and abuse of children at the Shiloh Residential Treatment Center. I am calling on the administration to provide the American people with an explanation for what I believe is the inhumane treatment of children. I believe that neither the administration, nor agencies therein, can hide behind subcontractors. I urge my colleagues to join in this argument and utilize their powers of congressional oversight to call for an end to this practice.

Recently, Northern District Director Albert Martinez presented Mr. and Mrs. Felix Farias of Seguin, Texas (pictured below) with a certificate and flag to commemorate their late son, U.S. Marine Corps Lance Corporal John Felix Farias, who was killed in action while serving in Afghanistan. It was my honor to have this American flag flown over the U.S. Capitol on the anniversary of this fallen officer's sacrifice for our country. Mr. and Mrs. Farias, your son is an American hero, and we are all forever indebted to his service.

On Thursday, July 26, 2018, my amendment encouraging high schools with U.S. Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (JROTC) to add cybersecurity coursework was included in the Conference Report to accompany H.R. 5519, the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. 
Increasing numbers of cyber-attacks and cyber terrorism put our country, democracy, our businesses, and even our own social media accounts, at risk. 
Our ability to sensibly detect and combat these threats starts in the classroom. Future generations of JROTC students will now be equipped with skillsets as innovative as the technology they use. Now is the time to better prepare and protect ourselves from cyber-attacks and develop sound strategies to address them. 
￼ 
On Tuesday, July 31, 2018, I joined community banking and housing leaders (first picture) to provide a legislative update (second picture) and chart a path forward for business and community development in South Texas. Our community bankers and housing leaders are our eyes and ears on the ground. Connecting with these individuals has given me a clearer picture of the local impact of what we have already done in the banking and housing space and where we need to go. I look forward to working with each and every one of them to continue building a brighter future for South Texans from all walks of life.

REBUILDING OUR MILITARY IN INDIANA
￼
Our brave men and women in uniform need the best tools and most advanced technology to keep them safe and help them succeed in their missions.
This week, I saw firsthand how the hardworking Hoosiers at Arconic in La Porte contribute to the cutting-edge F-35 Lightning II aircraft. I had a chance to tour their manufacturing facility and see the incredible work being done on complex engine components.
With the help of Arconic in La Porte and other suppliers in Indiana and across the country, the F-35 program supports our servicemembers, protects our national security, and strengthens our economy.
￼
The F-35 Lightning II isn’t just another stealth fighter – it’s the most advanced and most capable fighter in the world. It is a critical tool for our warfighters to counter the threats our nation faces, maintain our military readiness, and defeat any enemy.
￼
In Congress, we are working to give our military the tools, training, and support needed to keep America safe.
Providing for the national defense is our most important responsibility. Just last week, the House passed a bipartisan national defense bill that puts the safety and security of the American people first.
This critical bill boosts readiness by investing in maintenance, modernization, technology, and training. It restores our Armed Forces to full strength. And it gives our troops their biggest pay raise in nine years. I look forward to the Senate passing it and President Trump signing it into law.
BOYS & GIRLS CLUB OF ELKHART
￼
Thank you to the Boys & Girls Clubs of Elkhart County for the opportunity to visit the brand new Brady Center in Elkhart this week. It was an honor to meet these bright young Hoosiers and the dedicated staff and volunteers who help ensure they have what they need to succeed. I got to tour the club and learn all about the programs they have to offer.
￼
The knowledge, skills, and personal growth these kids will take away from their time with Boys & Girls Clubs is sure to stay with them far into their future. I am grateful for the resources and opportunities this organization provides our community, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds.

8/4/18 9:45,Good News for West Virginia,"￼  


Friends,  Yesterday, we received more good news regarding jobs and the economy. According to the U.S. Department of Labor’s latest jobs report, the U.S. economy added 157,000 jobs last month, and our unemployment rate dropped to 3.9 percent. This is a common trend under the leadership of President Trump and the Republican-led Congress. In fact, in West Virginia, our unemployment has been lower every single month during the Trump administration than it was during any month of President Obama’s eight years in office.  As our economy continues to improve, it’s important that our workforce has the knowledge and skills necessary to take advantage of all these new opportunities. That’s why Congress passed and the president signed into law the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, which will help improve career education and workforce development. Learn more about this news by clicking here or the image below, and keep scrolling for more exciting updates from this week in the Senate. 
￼ 
Continuing to Provide Resources for WV Priorities  This week, the Republican-led Congress continued to do the people’s work by debating and passing government funding legislation that makes critical investments in many national priorities. And even better news: The minibus appropriations legislation we passed this week includes significant resources for a wide range of priorities that are important to West Virginians and will go a long way in helping to meet numerous needs in the state.  From driving economic growth and development and cutting regulatory red tape to improving rural broadband access and fighting the opioid epidemic, this legislation will help support programs and projects that can improve the lives of families and individuals across the Mountain State. Read my full statement about the progress we made this week, and learn more about the West Virginia highlights included in the bill here. In case you missed it last week, click here or the image below for a video of remarks I made on the Senate floor to highlight many of the West Virginia priorities in the bill. 
￼ 
Supporting Our Next Supreme Court Justice  A few weeks ago, I told you about my meetings with Judge Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee to be our next U.S. Supreme Court justice. As a senator, I take my responsibility to evaluate presidential nominees very seriously. That is especially true when it comes to a nominee to our nation’s highest court. When I consider a Supreme Court nominee, I don’t look for a person who promises a particular policy outcome or someone who is out to actually create laws. Instead, I look for a person whose record reflects experience, fairness, and respect for the Constitution as it is written. After meeting with Judge Kavanaugh, it’s clear to me that he holds this same philosophy.  As the confirmation process for Judge Kavanaugh continues, I look forward to remaining engaged and supportive of him, and I urge my colleagues to set aside partisan rhetoric, stop the political theatrics, and do the same. Read more about why I’m supporting Judge Kavanaugh in a recent op-ed I penned for The Intelligencer / Wheeling News-Register and other Ogden publications here. 
￼ 
Senator Capito meets with Judge Kavanaugh in her office following his nomination. 
Helping to Deliver Assistance to State Efforts  Making sure our West Virginia communities, businesses, and programs have the resources they need to succeed is important. As a leader on the Senate Appropriations Committee, I’ve worked hard to advocate for West Virginia priorities when it comes to federal funding. This week, I was proud to announce several grants that will help communities and programs across the state. Learn more about each one below: 
	•	$2,900,000 for the Cowen Public Service District.
	•	$2,773,296 for various health care programs across the state.
	•	$1,278,441 for health information systems and research.
	•	$1,084,025 for Early Head Start programs for Raleigh County.
	•	$846,829 for airport enhancements in three WV counties.
	•	$400,000 to implement a new agritherapy pilot program.
	•	$122,429 to support safety efforts at a local volunteer fire department.
	•	$116,667 to spur economic development in West Virginia communities.

8/4/18 9:18,August 2018 - The Hastings Monthly Report,"￼

The Hastings Monthly Report
August 2018


Dear Friend,
Last week, the Trump Administration stood silently as electronic files allowing individuals to produce untraceable firearms through 3-D printing were posted online. I am deeply alarmed by the Administration’s continued inaction on gun violence and unwillingness to stand up for communities left devastated by this epidemic. The wide-spread printing of do-it-yourself guns will embolden those who seek to do us harm, putting the lives of law enforcement and the American public at great risk. The irreparable harm by the publication of these codes is unquestionable. We must take proactive steps, in Florida and across the country, to address the risk posed by these weapons before it is too late.
Trafficking Awareness
On July 30th, our country joined in observing United Nations World Day against Trafficking in Persons. Approximately twenty one million people are victims of trafficking each year, and three quarters of these victims are women and girls. Often, they are lured into this illicit multi-billion dollar industry under false premises or lies and subjected to forced labor and sexual exploitation. Centers of tourism, including Florida, are major destinations for human trafficking victims – many of whom come from our own communities and schools. Florida now has the third highest rate of trafficking in the country, and Broward and Palm Beach Counties rank 1st and 4th respectively for in-state incidences. I have continued to support anti-trafficking programs at the state and federal level, and have urged our school systems to do more to educate our children on the risks of trafficking. 
Recognizing Vietnam Veterans
As a country, we recognize the service, sacrifice, and patriotism of our veterans. Veterans of the Vietnam War never got the recognition they deserved, but they are no less worthy. In fact, when I meet Vietnam veterans in my district and thank them for their service, I am often told that I am the first person to ever do so. This is unfortunate, yet it happens far too frequently. This is why I have partnered with the United States of America Vietnam War Commemoration, which was authorized by Congress in commemoration of the War’s 50th anniversary, to help ensure that Vietnam veterans are thanked and given the respect they deserve.

PFAS data needs to be released



Dear Friend:  Welcome to your weekly update. As always, you can learn more about these and other legislative issue at my website: upton.house.gov.
PFAS data needs to be released
On Wednesday, I sent a letter to General Joseph Lengyel, Chief of the National Guard Bureau and Lieutenant General L. Scott Rice, Director of the Air National Guard, urging the swift release of data related to PFAS contamination testing at the W.K. Kellogg Air National Guard Base in Battle Creek, Michigan, as well as any plans to remediate possible contamination.
PFAS testing data collected on the base between April and May of this year was not shared at a public meeting on July 30.
It is utterly unacceptable and irresponsible that any information on PFAS levels would be withheld from individuals who are possibly affected. To read the full letter, please click here.
Also this week, I released a statement with my colleague U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Flint, in which we announced we would continue to work together to hold the EPA accountable and work on bipartisan legislation to set a national drinking water standard for PFAS. The EPA has failed to act with the proper urgency to set a standard and therefore we support bipartisan legislative action that would require them to do so.
Every Michigan family deserves safe and clean drinking water. No exceptions. Learn more here.
Learn more here on my work to respond to the PFAS issue.
Passing of Cass County Treasurer Linda Pruett
This week, I was saddened to hear Cass County Treasurer Lina Pruett passed away.
This is a truly tragic loss. Linda was a no-nonsense public servant who always had her constituent’s concerns number run. She ran a tight ship and was respected in so many ways by all who encountered her.
We will greatly miss her sense of humor and dedication to our community.
Busy at home 
With no votes in the House until September, I am back in Southwest Michigan for the August District Work Period.
Already, this week I passed out lunches and books to students at the South Haven Farm Market, celebrated our first responders at the 100 year anniversary of the Covert Township Fire Department and attended, and spoke, at a public town hall in Parchment on PFAS – just to name a few.
To stay up to date on my work here at home this summer, follow my Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter pages.
 Have a great weekend and God bless,

District Office Internships
To continue serving my constituents and to give college students exposure to a congressional office I am accepting internship applications for my Jonesboro district office.  Intern duties include assisting caseworkers in communicating with federal agencies, as well as, special project needs. Specifically, interns will answer calls from constituents expressing opinions on legislative matters and conduct legislative research to assist field staff working closely with local leaders. Interns will get the opportunity to experience how the federal government operates on a local level and will need proficient office, computer, and written and oral communication skills.   I would appreciate interns who are able to work a minimum of 10 hours each week with a consistent schedule, and each student must have a university advisor or professor serving as an intern advisor. This individual will receive monthly updates from the district office regarding the intern’s participation and duties performed in the district office.  While unpaid, internships are often approved for college credit. Interns do not need a background or interest in politics to apply, but they must always have a willingness to further the Congressman’s official priorities, regardless of their personal political leanings.  If interested, please email Sherrie.Mitchell@mail.house.gov or call the Jonesboro office at (870) 203-0540.
FAQ (What folks have been calling my office about this week)
Q: What will the Congressman do about 3D Printed Guns? 
A: The State Department has determined that they can no longer block the release of blueprints for 3D printed guns to the public. It is currently being determined in the courts whether these blueprints can be released. I understand the concerns about these guns potentially being untraceable, but I do not expect it to be an issue. These printers are expensive and for the guns to be effective they will require metal parts, rather than plastic. I will continue to monitor this situation as the blueprints become available to the public.
Q: What is the Congressman doing to ensure election security for midterm elections?
A: In the House Intelligence Committee, we concluded that Russia did attempt to influence our elections in 2016. Since we've started the investigation I've voiced the need to ensure that foreign interference in our elections never occurs again.That is why Congress allotted $380 million dollars to election security in the Omnibus Bill for the fiscal year of 2018. This was an important step to keep the most sacred part of our democracy safe and ensure our elections are secure from outside influence
Q: Who will the Congressman support for Speaker of the House?
A: I have received a lot of calls either asking me to support specific candidates for Speaker of the House or asking who I will support. It is simply too early to make my decision on who I would support, especially considering that midterm elections haven’t occurred yet. Feedback from my constituents is always welcomed and come November I look forward to casting my vote for a Speaker who will uphold and represent the ideals of the American people.

Washington Week Ahead: Senate actions on farm bill, ag spending on tap
Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Ark., said he and other House conferees were told to be on call during August in case they are needed for a meeting. He expressed optimism that a new bill could be enacted this fall.
“I’m sure there will be some contentious issues that will be discussed, but at the end of the day we’ll get it done, and the president is going to sign it, and we’ll move on,” Crawford said. 
The toughest issue the negotiators face is what to do about the House GOP’s demands to tighten work requirements for people who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits. Roberts said he thought a deal could be fashioned around the work that USDA has done on ways to modify rules for state and local waivers of the work requirements.  Arkansas Democrat-Gazette Trump: AG should end Mueller probe 'right now'  U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford, a Republican from Jonesboro who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, said Trump's dissatisfaction with Mueller's probe is shared by others.
""We see sort of an attitude out of the Department of Justice that they're really not subject to any kind of oversight and they'll do things the way they want to do it and they don't like to provide answers to Congress,"" he said. ""This whole thing has really kind of tried my patience, and I think the patience of my constituents. And anybody who is watching this probably can sense that.""
There's no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians, Crawford said.
""Either bring forth some evidence and charge people or it's time to shut it down,"" he said.

Greetings Friend,
 
I had the honor of attending a Naturalization Ceremony where 110 people swore their allegiance to the Constitution and to America at the Utah State Capitol.   
 
￼
￼
 
It’s truly a joy to see and meet the people who take that oath seriously and to share my family’s story with them.  They now have something that no one can take away: full, legal American citizenship.  

I am concerned about the impact of tariffs on Utah’s economy.  I recently had the opportunity to meet with top White House economic and trade advisors to speak with them about the current situation.  I am also co-sponsoring a bill that would limit the President’s authority to impose certain tariffs.
 
My comments on the meeting with White House economic advisor Peter Navarro and Economic Council Larry Kudlow are contained in this article.
 
The bill I mentioned, H.R. 6337, would require the President to consult Congress before levying tariffs in the interest of national security.  Under this legislation, Congress would have 60 days to review the proposed tariffs, which could also be fast-tracked to ensure consideration.  There is a similar bill in the Senate.

I am pleased to host open office hours next Wednesday at 10am in my District office.  This is an opportunity exclusively for you, my constituents.  Please sign up at love.house.gov, and I look forward to seeing you there!

Opioid Manufacturers Must Be Held Accountable
The House Energy and Commerce Committee announced this week that it is expanding the investigation on the opioid crisis to include opioid manufacturers. The investigation had previously focused on five of the nation’s largest distributors who oversaw the shipment of large amounts of opioid pills into West Virginia, as well as the DEA’s oversight over these companies. 

The nearly 800 million opioid pills that were shipped into small communities throughout West Virginia has wreaked havoc on our communities and contributed to our state becoming the epicenter of the opioid epidemic. Bad doctors and pharmacies running pill mills are being held accountable for their contribution to the scourge of this crisis, but the distributors and manufacturers need to accept responsibility for their role as well.

Previously, we had the distributors before the Committee and they shirked all responsibility for their part in this epidemic. This is a process and we’re now taking steps to hold the manufacturers accountable.

McKinley: Further Closures of Coal and Nuclear Power Plants Dangerous to America's National Security
Yesterday, I joined the West Virginia Coal Association to discuss the serious national security risks from the continued premature closures of coal and nuclear-fired power plants. With the verified threats from cyber-attacks and the stresses on our electric grid during extreme weather events, coal and nuclear are essential to maintaining reliable, resilient electricity.

Our office has been advocating with President Trump to use his emergency authority to keep these power plants open and protect the security of our electric grid.

Dear Friends,
On Monday, I hosted the 7th Congressional District Opioid Symposium in an effort to raise awareness, reduce the stigma and engage the community on best practices occurring throughout the 7th District.  The Symposium focused on the main categories of stigma, rehabilitation, prevention, and enforcement.  If you were unable to attend the event, I invite you to re-watch the live stream of the event by clicking on this link.  Additionally, please see below for some of the articles written on the event.  
I look forward to continuing our work, as a community, to reduce the stigma surrounding opioid addiction and curb this scourge.

 ￼  ""Symposium Brings Stories and Solutions to Ongoing Opioid Crisis""  By: Andrew James July 30, 2018 
The ongoing battle against the opioid drug epidemic is front and center in the public spotlight. Congressman David Rouzer created a group to spread awareness and information. 
This symposium comes after months of planning by the Congressman and other. It brought together key figures on every level, from the recovery clinic to the USDA all in an effort to reach those struggling and inform others. 
“We’re going to celebrate recovery wherever it’s found,” said Kenny House Vice President of Clinical Services at Coastal Horizons. 
House spoke alongside Mark Allen who leads the Refuge recovery program at Port City Community Church. It’s a conversation we have had with them before. This time was different as their panel discussion reached dozens on a public platform organized by the Congressman and his staff. 
These men also sit on the steering committee Rep. Rouzer developed that also includes federal officials talking prevention programs as well as county Sheriff’s and District Attorney’s Jon and Ben David. 
His idea for this committee sparked by the sit down he had with Alecia Roberts and her team. 
“Tonight is proof that we do have voice and when we speak out even when we’re not sure that we’re going to get that response that we’re looking for, that sometimes we do,” said Roberts who chairs the group NC Coalition of Parents for Change. 
The group is composed of parents impacted by the opioid epidemic. Roberts lost her 25-year-old daughter to it. 
A year ago she reached out to the congressman to join their effort to bring those addicted to recovery and safety. To her surprise, he answered the call. 
“Extremely grateful, my heart is full,” said Roberts. 
The discussion ended with everyone elevating the message Roberts has for so many parents and victims. 
“Don’t lose hope, don’t lose faith and don’t give up and keep fighting for them,” said Roberts. 
Rep. Rouzer’s staff told Roberts they will look at hosting the symposium as an annual event. 
￼  ""Rouzer Hosts Symposium on Opioid Addiction""  By: Lindsay Kriz July 31, 2018 
Opioid experts came together to share their knowledge at the 7th District Opioid Symposium, hosted by Congressman David Rouzer at Coastline Conference & Event Center on Monday night. 
Three panels discussed four topics: stigma, treatment, prevention and enforcement. 
Mark Allen, representing the faith-based community as a refuge coordinator for Port City Community Church in Wilmington, struggled with addiction for 22 years. He said he knows firsthand there can be freedom from opioid abuse, but the stigma behind the disease keeps so many people hidden from seeking treatment. “Stigma keeps people in a place of shame,” he said. 
Kenny House, vice president of Coastal Horizons Inc.’s clinical services, said the way to bring people out of hiding and into a place where treatment and recovery are possible, is to normalize the discussion about addiction as a chronic illness. 
Yvette Barbour lost her husband Michael Barbour on May 16 to an opioid overdose. Her addiction to crack cocaine at 18 evolved into a heroin addiction, but she got and remained clean for her son, Mikey, after the Department of Social Services removed him from the home and even as her husband kept using. 
Lona Currie said talking about her disease with others was what helped her keep going through recovery. Before that, she said she had a negative view of herself — feeling like a criminal and praying for death every time she would use again. 
“I used because there was no hope for me,” she said. “When people love you where you are — you are a process — you begin to reach for hope.” 
Matt Jones, who works as a volunteer at Port City Community Church, said he found in the church and the community people who would love and support him no matter how broken he was. 
“I drank for the first time in fourth grade. Attention was my first addiction,” he said. 
Jones had bouts of success, like getting a scholarship to play football at the collegiate level, but his lack of self esteem led him to addiction and homelessness. He sought refuge and recovery for years and found it three years ago in his move to Wilmington. 
“I really started to see through Christ and through ministry that God was kind, saying, ‘Dude, what other people say doesn’t really matter, because I’ve got so much more for you, and if you allow me to work in your life, and if you allow me to the opportunity and get to know who I am and who I call you to, maybe we can change some lives, and maybe we can touch some people,’” Jones said. “So that’s really kind of where I started, and where I am today.” 
Anne Hazlett, U.S. Department of Agriculture assistant to the secretary for rural development, said because so much of rural America has conservative values, the subject of addiction is difficult to address. Too much discussion is based on the idea that young people are the only ones affected by the opioid crisis, she said. 
“Drug overdoses are the leading cause of death for adults under 50 also,” she said. “We need prevention activity in rural communities.” 
Some successful campaigns in rural communities include the “Let’s Talk” campaign out of Crawford County, Pa., which opens up a conversation and focuses on local stories of addiction that are featured on hospital websites, and “Operation Unite” out of eastern Kentucky. Operation Unite works with 32 counties in the state deeply affected by the opioid crisis and hosts a weeklong summer camp for children to remind them they have a bright future no matter what their home life is like. This year, it had 223 campers from 23 counties. 
“I think in many rural places the crisis is fueled by hopelessness and despair and the lack of opportunity, and isolation,” Hazlett said. “It’s time for rural leaders (to address) deeper and systemic challenges we see in rural communities.” 
Dr. Phil Brown, executive vice president and chief physician executive at New Hanover Regional Medical Center, said treatment and scientific knowledge have come a long way since bloodletting caused the death of George Washington. The most recent NHRMC medicine take-back events have brought in 7,000 pounds of medication, 50,000 needles and $90,000 in unneeded medicine. 
“The amount of fewer opioid tablets in our county is 1 million,” he said. 
Brown said first responders went to 79 overdose calls between January and March this year. Between January and March 2017, the number was 124 — a 37 percent reduction. The number of visits for opioid overdoses from January through June of this year is 36, down 64 percent from the same period in 2017. 
Brown also praised the work of The Tides nonprofit in New Hanover County, which is working to treat pregnant addicts and keep families together from birth through postpartum and recovery stages. 
The first baby to be helped through the nonprofit was born last Wednesday, with both mother and baby being treated for chemical dependency, Brown said. 
“We’re creating a completely different future for this family, and that’s what it’s all about,” he said. 
Twin brothers Jon David and Ben David, district attorneys for the 13th and 5th prosecutorial districts, respectively, emphasized the importance of differentiating between users and dealers, and between those who sell opioids to feed their own addictions and those who sell them for profit. Dealers in the latter category have the attention of their offices. 
“We have to remove from the debate what a users looks like and what a dealer looks like,” Ben David said. 
“Tonight is about consciously stepping outside of silence,” Jon David said. “We have to have prevention, and we must remove stigmatization.”

Q&A: Flores Agreement
Q. How does the Flores v. Reno agreement apply to detention policy at the southern border? Q. How would you amend the Flores settlement to improve immigration enforcement?

Workers who come forward to report fraud or misconduct in the federal government are frequently punished by their superiors for simply telling the truth. These brave citizens should not be penalized, they should be praised. In honor of National Whistleblower Appreciation Day, I gave a speech to thank our citizen truth-tellers. They deserve our profound gratitude.  
Like millions of Americans, I was disturbed by thousands of children being separated from their parents. I convened a Judiciary Committee hearing to examine the progress of reuniting these children with their families. For years, Congress has failed to take action to prevent family separations. In an op-ed I wrote with Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Ted Cruz of Texas, we recognize that a legislative fix to the Flores consent decree is the only viable solution. This would allow families to stay together and prevent it from happening in future administrations.  
Governor Reynolds determined that the recent natural disasters in Iowa are of such severity and magnitude that federal assistance is needed. I joined the entire Iowa delegation in writing to President Trump urging the Administration to grant Governor Reynold's request for a declaration of a major disaster for 30 Iowa counties in response to severe weather.
The Des Moines Register recently published reports revealing a disturbing lack of professional and compassionate care for elderly residents in some of Iowa’s nursing homes. Particularly heartbreaking is the case of one nursing home resident who passed away seemingly due to lapses in care at the facility. In light of these reports, I’ve asked the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for more information into what happened and what steps will be taken moving forward to stop it from happening to anyone else. I’ll continue to work to improve the quality of life for older Americans in Iowa and throughout the nation as long as I serve as Iowa’s senior senator.
I’m proud to preside over what will be the most transparent Supreme Court confirmation process in history. Judge Brett Kavanaugh's record includes his more than 300 opinions written during his 12 years on the D.C. Circuit, in addition to the hundreds more opinions he joined and the more than 17,000 pages submitted in connection with his Senate Judiciary Questionnaire. The Senate will receive more pages of executive branch documents than we did for any Supreme Court nominee ever. This is more than enough information for the Senate to conduct a fair and thorough review of the President's Supreme Court nominee.

Dear Friend, 
Florida’s fisheries are a very important precious resource that have a substantial impact on Florida’s environment and economy.  Hurricane Irma had a significant effect on our state’s commercial and recreational fishing industry, which is why I joined with my colleagues from the Florida delegation to fight for $44,608,039 in disaster relief funding for this industry.  The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) is in the process of developing a plan for how to best utilize these funds, in cooperation with the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (DEO).  I am told that any stakeholder wishing to provide input into the development of this plan should contact Jim Estes at 850-251-2458 as soon as possible, since the plan is likely to be completed by mid-August.  My hope is that these funds will be distributed as quickly as possible so that those of you who experienced economic hardship due to hurricane losses can begin to recover. 
There has also been a great deal of conversation about drilling off the coast of Florida.  Please be assured I also understand how dangerous an oil spill would be to our pristine natural resources, sensitive environment and the tourism industry upon which our state’s economy is dependent.  Therefore, I have worked in a bi-partisan manner with members from the Florida delegation to protect our state.  While we did receive assurances from the administration that there would be no drilling off Florida’s coast, I’ve co-sponsored a bill to extend the current moratorium on drilling until 2029, and another bill to make the current moratorium permanent.  There is widespread support from within our delegation that we must ensure drilling does not happen off our coast.  I will continue to work with my colleagues to protect our state. 
Finally, I wanted to mention the recent House vote on the reauthorization of the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  I heard from many of my constituents who expressed concerns about the sustainability of Florida’s fisheries.  As a result,  I opposed the bill.  Unfortunately, it did pass the House.  I will work with my Senate colleagues to try to address the concerns of my constituents as the legislation moves to the next phase in the process. 
Again, thank you for allowing me to update you on the status of issues impacting Florida’s fisheries.  Should you have any federal issue that I can assist you with, please do not hesitate to contact my office. 
Sincerely,
￼ 
Gus Bilirakis

Dear Friend, 
No matter how busy the calendar in Washington, or how tense the political climate, it is a summer tradition for representatives to spend time back in the district listening to constituents.  This past week, I had many important conversations during community town hall meetings in Bellevue, Lincoln, Blair, Fremont, David City, Columbus, and Norfolk.
Here is the positive news.  From innovative whole person care clinics to ag tech startups, to farm-to-table restaurants and breweries, local entrepreneurial momentum has picked up.  Economic activity is rising.  So are wages.  Tax cuts and deregulation have helped.  Nebraska remains one of the happiest places to live.  
Here’s where work needs to be done. What is clear: Many people are very anxious about our country, some heatedly so.  The First Congressional District is very diverse. From the issues of how trade will affect the Nebraska ag sector to investigations into Russian collusion, from the importance of Social Security and Medicare to our growing national debt, a wide range of perspectives formed the discussion.  
This is not exhaustive, but here are some quotes that summarize the general points made at the meetings. 
“You’ve failed in your duty to checks and balances.  Speaker, Senate, House all failed to do their duty.” 
“Read about Russian’s hacking our electrical grid, airport guidance, elections.  I’m concerned things aren’t getting done to protect us.”
“Thanks for taking these difficult questions, it means you care.” 
“The news makes me nervous.  Who’s really in charge of the news?” 
“How confident are you that President Trump is being truthful about collusion?”
“I’m a farmer, get government out of my business.” 
“At what point should Congress step in during the Mueller investigation?” 
“You need to educate people more about reviewing their Medicare prescription drugs plans every year.”
“Young people have no idea what Medicare is.  They think Medicare is free.  Not true!” 
“I’m upset when Medicare is referred to as an entitlement program.” 
“How can you justify your bi-partisan bill for wildlife when we’re flooding along the Missouri River? What are you going to do to help?  We're retired but can’t endure constant flooding.  We lost 28 acres to flooding.”
“No border? Try living without a front door on your home.” 
“If we lose the 2nd Amendment, we’re done.  We’d have no way to protect ourselves.” 
“Did you read and understand the Omnibus Spending Bill? Why do we do it that way?”
“With respect to the Chinese stealing intellectual property, do they steal from other countries too?” 
“When are we getting away from the Russian investigation? Move on and spend time on it when all these other things addressed.” 
“Everyone should read the history of how the Declaration of Independence came about.” 
“The health care issue is unfair to farmers…especially when young people have to leave the farm to secure health care.” 
“How do you feel about the Wall?”  
""If Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh is confirmed, will it really strongly affect and shape our country?” 
""What do you see as a reasonable immigration plan?”   
Again, this is just a sampling of what was said.  In a time when many officials have stopped these types of meetings due to security concerns and the hyper-volatility, I believe it is important that we hold dear the essential Nebraska value of civil discourse.
I have to say that the first person who spoke said something quite interesting: “You look different.  A bit thinner.”    Sincerely, ￼  Congressman Jeff Fortenberry

Russians Attempts to Divide Americans Continue; 
We Must Do More to Stop It
 
 This week, the Senate Intelligence Committee heard from third-party experts on about foreign influence operations’ continued use of social media platforms to sow discord and divide Americans. These assaults on the democratic foundation of this republic cannot stand, and our Committee, in a bipartisan fashion, is addressing the issue head-on.   
 
 Russia continues its aggressive and pervasive influence campaign against the United States to create chaos in the virtual domain and create potential dangerous physical confrontations between unwitting Americans. The Russian-affiliated cyber actors want to spread disinformation, provoke societal conflict and undermine public faith in our democratic institutions.  Yesterday’s experts confirmed that these operations were never about elections, they were meant to exploit divisive issues like race and religion to sow discord.  These actors want to weaken America.

 WATCH – Senator Burr: “We’re Fighting for the Integrity of Our Society”
 
 As I told our panelists this week, some feel that we as a society are sitting in a burning room, calmly drinking a cup of coffee, telling ourselves this is fine. That’s not fine, and that’s not the case. The challenge we face – preserving our American rights while defending them against a hostile foreign power – is a difficult one, but the Senate Intelligence Committee is uniquely positioned to foster this critical conversation. We are now entering the 20th month of our investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections. In recent months, we have released a series of initial findings, provided recommendations to help improve election security, and unanimously passed out of Committee an Intelligence Authorization Act that will ensure the United States Intelligence Community has the tools, resources, and authorities needed to defend our nation. 
 
 We’re fighting for nothing less than the integrity of our society, and we need to enlist every person we can. What happened in 2016 is just one look at Russia’s attempts to erode the world’s faith in democracy by weakening history’s greatest example of it. We cannot and will not let them succeed.

U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s eNewsletter - - July 30th through August 3rd

 McConnell: I Will Continue to Stand with the Brave Men and Women of ICE 
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell visited the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office in Louisville, Kentucky on Friday, July 27th to personally thank the brave men and women for their work. In fiscal year 2017, ICE recorded more than 105,000 arrests of aliens with known criminal convictions on their records: nearly 4,600 convictions for robbery, more than 3,700 for sexual assault, and more than 1,500 for homicide. We’re talking about the men and women in law enforcement who confront all this in order to keep their fellow citizens safe. This is hardly a controversial mission. It’s essential. We are lucky these agents are willing to serve. The nation is better off for it.
Click the image below to view the Senator's video message during his visit to the ICE office in Louisville ￼
This week Senator McConnell delivered remarks this week on the Senate floor regarding his ICE visit, saying:
""I wanted to pay these agents a visit in Louisville and thank them firsthand for their work. Because recently, they’ve fallen into the crosshairs of some extremely vocal far-left special interest groups. Groups who explicitly say -- now get this -- that our nation would be better off with no borders and no immigration laws of any kind...
""This is the moment we’re in. Leading Democrats taking cues from the open-borders socialist crowd and proposing to eliminate the very agency that enforces federal immigration laws within the interior of our nation. Talk about a political stunt. The American people want nothing to do with these dangerous antics.
""My neighbors and constituents in Kentucky certainly don’t. So my fellow Republicans and I will continue to proudly stand with ICE, stand with the rule of law, and stand with all the American families who would rather have fewer drugs and less crime in the communities where they’re raising their children.""
Click the image below to view the Senator's floor speech ￼
On Wednesday, Senator McConnell's column was published in the Courier Journal. He wrote:
""I’m really not sure where to begin in responding to this foaming hysteria. It is one thing for a few protestors and socialist hecklers who want open borders and the elimination of all immigration laws to adopt a slogan as silly and ill-considered as “Abolish ICE.” But it is something else entirely when United States senators are so eager to please these left-wing extremists that they join in denigrating the men and women of U.S. law enforcement.   ""I never thought I would have to defend capitalism in America. Our nation has enjoyed unprecedented prosperity and become the leader of the free world as a result of our commitment to the free market. The American Dream is based on the promise of individual freedom and opportunity, not the top-down, government controlled system proposed by socialists. Socialism is a complete rejection of our nation’s core values and the ideas which have lifted billions of people out of poverty around the world."" Click HERE to read the entire column.
On Friday, Senator McConnell discussed this topic in addition to President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, with radio host, Tony Cruise, on 840 WHAS Radio in Louisville. Click the following image to listen to the interview:

McCain 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) conference report, which authorizes $716 billion to equip and train America’s 21st-century forces to meet and overcome today’s security challenges. The bipartisan bill authorizes more than $150 million in funding secured by Senator McConnell for military construction projects at installations in Kentucky in addition to other defense priorities. The bill also supports our troops with a well-earned pay raise.
WDRB-TV in Louisville reported on the military construction projects Senator McConnell helped secure money for  at installations in Kentucky:
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) praised Senate passage of the John S. McCain 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)...The list includes training facilities for the 101st Airborne at Fort Campbell, the Army's Human Resources Command and Recruiting Command at Fort Knox and support for chemical weapon demilitarization at the Blue Grass Army Depot.
Kentucky projects funded by the defense bill include:
	•	$26 million for a Digital Air/Ground Integration Range at Fort Knox 
	•	$32 million for a Vehicle Maintenance Shop at Fort Campbell 
	•	$18 million for a Microgrid and Power Plant at Fort Campbell 
	•	$62.6 million for the Fort Campbell Middle School 
	•	$5.4 million for a Special Operations Forces Logistics Support Operations Facility at Fort Campbell 
	•	$9.1 million for a Special Operations Forces Air/Ground Integration Urban Live Fire Range at Fort Campbell 
	•	$5.1 million for a Special Operations Forces Multi-Use Helicopter Training Facility at Fort Campbell 
	•	$993.8 million for Department of Defense chemical agents and munitions destruction activities, which will support chemical demilitarization efforts at the Blue Grass Army Depot. 
The bill also gives authority for the production and use of natural gas at Fort Knox.
McConnell Secures Funding for Kentucky  
Senator McConnell secured a number of critical resources for Kentucky in a government funding bill that passed the Senate on Wednesday. This legislation now goes to a Conference Committee to finalize the differences between the Senate and House versions of the bill.
The provisions Senator McConnell secured in the bill include the following:
	•	a measure to combat the infestation of Asian Carp in both Kentucky Lake and Lake Barkley in Western Kentucky; 
	•	funding for the Abandoned Mine Land (AML) pilot program, which will provide $25 million to Kentucky for economic development activities in communities with abandoned mine sites; 
	•	a provision to direct the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to encourage grant recipients to provide more transitional housing opportunities for individuals transitioning from substance abuse treatment back into the workforce; and 
	•	language that allows haulers of coal, livestock, grain, and other agricultural products to continue to use the Julian M. Carroll Purchase and William H. Natcher Parkways in Western Kentucky to move products efficiently to market. 
Senator McConnell applauded passage of the bill, saying, ""Every single day, Kentuckians from across the Commonwealth contact me with their concerns. As Senate Majority Leader and a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I am able to ensure that these issues – both large and small – are part of the national discussion. Kentucky continues to punch above its weight in Washington, and I am proud to be a strong voice for my constituents in the Senate.""
WKDZ Radio in Cadiz, Kentucky reported on Senate passage of funding to combat Asian Carp:
""Some good news out of the nation’s Capital Wednesday regarding the war on Asian Carp. The U.S. Senate has passed U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s measure to combat the spread of Asian Carp in both Kentucky Lake and Lake Barkley...McConnell’s provision directs the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to focus its efforts on combating the serious threat of the invasive species in the lakes in Land Between the Lakes Recreational Area. The legislation also provides $11 million dollars — a $600,000 increase from last year’s enacted level – for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to control Asian Carp in both lakes and the larger Mississippi and Ohio River Basins.
""McConnell says with the passage of the Senate bill, they are one step closer to sending federal resources to combat the spread of Asian Carp in western Kentucky. He notes the Asian Carp is severely affecting tourism, the Lake Barkley and Kentucky Lake communities, and the multi-billion dollar fishing industry in the state. He adds the fish are not only a danger for the local economy, but they are also a safety hazard for anglers and boaters.""

 McConnell to Serve as a Key Negotiator on Farm Bill Conference Committee   
This week, Senator McConnell was officially named as a Senate member for the Farm Bill Conference Committee. The Conference Committee includes members from both chambers who will reconcile the Senate and House versions of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Farm Bill). On the Conference, Senator McConnell is joined by Representative James Comer (KY-01), who was named as a House conferee in July.
“I have proudly served on the Agriculture Committee since my first day in the Senate and know exactly how important this legislation is to agricultural communities across Kentucky, so as Majority Leader, I put myself on the Conference, and we’re ready to get to work to ensure the future of American agriculture,” said Senator McConnell. “I will advocate for Kentucky’s multi-billion-dollar agriculture industry that supports thousands of good jobs and families in nearly every corner of the Commonwealth. Additionally, I will strongly advocate to legalize industrial hemp. I’m optimistic that my Hemp Farming Act, which I secured in the Senate bill, will be included in the final bill sent to the President for his signature. I am also glad to have the support of Congressman Comer on the Conference for legalizing industrial hemp.”
Kentucky Farm Bureau President Mark Haney said, “The Farm Bill is important to farm families and rural communities in Kentucky and across the country. It is critical to the agriculture industry to get this piece of legislation finalized and on the President’s desk. The process of bringing the House and Senate versions together is about to begin. Kentucky Farm Bureau is grateful to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for making the passage of the Farm Bill a priority and choosing to appoint himself to the Conference Committee. The Commonwealth will be well-represented with Congressman James Comer also serving. I would like to thank these agriculture champions for their continued support of this bill and for their commitment to the hard-working farmers who provide the valuable food and fiber needed in our state, this nation, and around the world.”

An All-Out Assault on Children’s & Seniors’ Health


￼
Medicare and Medicaid Under Threat 
I had the great privilege of returning to Mission Neighborhood Health Center on Tuesday to discuss our shared commitment to protecting the health care of our San Francisco residents.  Thank you to the courageous advocates like Jonah Cohen and his mother Jennifer, and Brenda Storey and her daughter, Sage, who told their stories about the impact of the GOP health care sabotage on their lives.  
Fifty-three years ago, President Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law, making a fundamental promise of health and economic security to our seniors and working families.  Two years after President Johnson signed that legislation, Mission Neighborhood Health Center opened its doors, securing the promise of health and economic security for so many San Franciscans.
Yet today, our nation’s bedrock guarantee of dignity and security is under attack. Republicans’ malicious campaign to undermine these bedrock promises has left the American people with a raw deal on health care, jeopardizing our families’ futures and the future of our economy.  After exploding the deficit with their tax scam, they are fighting to dismantle protections for 130 million people with pre-existing conditions and working to shatter the guarantee of Medicare and Medicaid.
Democrats are fighting for A Better Deal for the people, with real action to strengthen the vital lifelines of Medicare and Medicaid, lower Americans’ health care and prescription drug costs and protect the health care of people with pre-existing conditions. 
￼ 
Congresswoman Pelosi San Francisco held a press conference highlighting relentless attacks on Medicare, Medicaid and people with pre-existing conditions with impacted individuals and families at the Mission Neighborhood Health Center.  
Hunters Point Naval Shipyard Clean-Up 
Last Friday, I sent letters to the Office of Inspectors General of the EPA and Navy calling for an immediate investigation of the failed Tetra Tech EC clean-up and for an urgent briefing on the status of the Hunters Point clean-up and re-testing.  Following my request, on Tuesday, I met with representatives from the Navy, Environmental Protection Agency, California Department of Public Health, California Department of Toxic Substances Control and Hunters Point Naval Shipyard Citizens Advisory Council.
I articulated my concerns and those of the community about the unacceptable lack of progress and the results of the clean-up, in addition to the concerns of transparency from the federal agencies.  Bayview-Hunters Point residents deserve an expedited plan to clean up the Shipyard to restore trust within the community, address concerns about health and safety, and deliver on promises of revitalization and opportunity. 
The fraud committed by Tetra Tech EC was universally acknowledged as unprecedented and wholly unacceptable.  All parties agreed that it is essential to hold Tetra Tech EC accountable for their monumental failures and that progress must be made expeditiously and as safely as possible. 
The health and security of Bayview-Hunters Point residents remains a top priority of mine, and I will continue to work closely with the community and state and federal agencies to ensure the proper completion of this project.

My office recently assisted a constituent who was experiencing issues with retirement benefits from the Social Security Administration (SSA). As a dual American-Canadian citizen, she was required to provide documentation from the SSA showing coverage in order to qualify for the Canadian pension program. She had contacted our office because she was unable to obtain a resolution on her own. Therefore, my office contacted SSA on her behalf and conveyed the details of her situation. As a result, SSA sent over the relevant documentation, allowing her to receive her pension.

August 3, 2018 
Dear Friend,  This Thursday, I hosted my 8th annual Central Valley Jobs Fair at Modesto Junior College. Over 60 employers from a wide variety of fields participated, including major companies like Amazon and McDonalds, and local businesses like Taylor Farms. For the past eight years, my jobs fair has connected thousands of CA-10 residents to jobs right here in our community. I have made it a priority in Congress to bring more jobs to the Central Valley, and the job fair provides job seekers the opportunity to connect with employers across our community.  I am especially optimistic about the results of this year’s event given the strong state of our economy. Since I entered federal office in 2011, the employment rate in California’s 10th District has gone from over 17 percent to under 7 percent. In Modesto, this number is even lower, hovering around 5.1 percent. Veterans, too, are seeing unemployment rates decrease, with Stanislaus County veterans at just 3.7 percent unemployment, right around the national average. In the second quarter of 2018, Gross Domestic Product grew at 4.1%, putting the economy on pace to grow at 3% for the calendar year for the first time in 13 years.  I extend my thanks to all the businesses who came out to this year’s jobs fair, and a special thanks to all the members of our community who came to participate. I am already looking forward to next year! As your Representative, I will continue to work hard to expand opportunities for all members of our Central Valley Community. 
￼ 
Naturalization ceremony On Tuesday, 82 new citizens joined these United States as new citizens in a ceremony held right here in Ceres. I am extremely proud to have had the opportunity to welcome people from all over the world into our community, where they now have the chance to work, raise their family, and forge a bright future. I would also like to take the opportunity to thank my excellent staff, who coordinated with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to make this ceremony possible.  The promise of America should be available to all who are willing to work hard for a better life. Our country is made better when brave, enterprising people like these are willing to take enormous risk for a better life. Ensuring that the federal government is taking care of those that wear the cloth of this great nation will always be a priority of mine. 
￼ 
HR 5899 School Based health centers This week, I agreed to cosponsor a bill that will improve access to important health care services for children in the 10th District. School-Based Health Centers are healthcare centers that are set up inside of public schools. There are thousands of these Health Centers across the country, serving more than 2 million K-12 students. Four of these centers are in our area – in Modesto, Riverbank, and Westley, and they play a major role in providing a safe environment for our children to get the specialized care they need. The School-Based Health Centers Reauthorization Act provides funding for these critical institutions for the next five years, making sure that our children can still receive the services that they need to stay healthy and active.  Communities like ours face unique barriers in accessing healthcare and we have faced some of the greatest challenges trying to fight the opioid epidemic and other major health crises. Access is the number one healthcare issue facing our community, and student health centers are an innovative approach to bringing essential services to children. Our children should continue to have a safe and healthy environment at school. With common-sense bills like these, Congress can work to provide peace of mind to American families and children who otherwise do not have access to healthcare services.  Check out my new veterans e-newsletter and subscribe Each quarter I distribute a special edition newsletter with the latest veterans news out of Washington to local VFW Halls and on my website; but now you can subscribe to receive this special edition newsletter directly in your inbox by visiting www.Denham.house.gov/vets and filling out the form at the top of the page.

Gov, please support legacy workers

In a letter to Governor Ralph Torres this week I asked him to support the Northern Mariana Islands Workforce Stabilization Act—my bill that gives permanent status to our long-term workers and investors. The Governor has not yet replied, or endorsed my bill, H.R. 6578. I introduced the Stabilization Act two days after the Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act was signed into law. I included a definition of “long-term worker” in the Workforce Act, so that I could use that legal definition in the Stabilization Act to determine who would be eligible for permanent status. This legal definition makes it much easier to get support for the bill. In fact, after just one week we now have 20 cosponsors. I have worked for permanent status since I came to Congress, and I have learned in those ten years that persistence pays off. I hope Governor Torres will decide to support my new legislation and all our legacy workers and investors.

Honoring a friend at USCIS. Mr. Paul Powell of the USCIS Office of Legislative Affairs, who passed away in April, was so important in easing the Marianas through the immigration transition period and contributed much to our work on the Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act, Public Law 115-218. Last week, I met with some of his colleagues in a USCIS conference room now named in honor of Mr. Powell. With me next to the plaque commemorating Paul is Senior Legal Advisor Mr. Philip Busch. Also on hand to discuss implementation of the U.S. Workforce Act were representatives of the agency’s legislative affairs, policy, and field operations offices.

Help us help veterans

We need the help of veterans, family members, and those who provide services to veterans in building the case for a Vet Center in the Marianas. Some have already helped by completing the needs assessment survey that we distributed at this year’s Veterans Resource Fair, but we need more. Vet Centers assist veterans with transitioning into civilian life. I met with then-Secretary David Shulkin last fall and got his approval for a needs assessment, as a first step. And I enlisted the help of Dr. Edward Santos Director of the Vet Center in Guam, who devised the survey. Now we need your responses. You can take the survey here, online. All responses will be confidential and anonymous.

VA home loans available

Veterans interested in home loan assistance recently attended the Department of Veterans Affairs presentation on the Native American Direct Loan Program on Saipan. The program can be used to purchase, build, or improve a home. Let us know if you need help accessing this program or contact Jennifer Camacho at the Northern Marianas Housing Corporation, 670-234-6866. The chart below shows the maximum loan amount available for locations in the Marianas in 2018.

July Update From Congressman Kurt Schrader
 

￼
When the government shut down in 2013, something I heard about all the time was “How come I can’t get into my national park?” and “Why is Crater Lake closed?” As Oregonians, we love our national parks, but we love them a little too much. Currently, our national parks are in dire need of maintenance with a more than ten billion dollar backlog. This month, I introduced the bipartisan Restore Our Parks & Public Lands Act, along with Chairman Rob Bishop (R-UT) and Ranking Member Raul Grijalva (D-AZ) of the House Natural Resources Committee, to bring down that maintenance backlog because our ability to enjoy and appreciate the natural beauty of our parks, like Crater Lake, relies on sufficient funding for them. Watch our press conference on the bill’s introduction by clicking here.
￼
I share the frustration and anger with this Administration’s immigration policies that I know so many of you feel. This month, we saw continued vacant leadership in the House with a forced vote on a do-nothing resolution rather than any vote at all on actual legislation to reform our immigration system, pass the Dream Act, or take action on the zero-tolerance policy at the border. At the beginning of the month, I went down to the border to see firsthand the chaos, confusion, and heartbreak caused by the administration’s cavalier zero-tolerance policy, and over the past few months I have called out the treatment of those not only at our southern border, but here in Oregon, including calling for hearings and oversight into some egregious actions taken by some ICE agents. I closely monitor the treatment of the detainees at the prison in Sheridan, and I’ve had conversations with Oregon ICE Acting Field Office Director Elizabeth Godfrey regarding raids and harassment of Oregonians and also with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE back in Washington, DC. I have had enough of political stunts from leadership in Congress. It’s time for Congress to address these issues in a meaningful way.
￼
￼
This month, I was pleased that a bipartisan bill to strengthen our career and technical education (CTE) programs that I cosponsored – which was last authorized in 2006 – passed Congress unanimously and was signed into law on the 31st. Industry leaders and business owners throughout our district often tell me that they have open job positions they can’t fill because workers with the necessary skill sets just don’t exist. The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act will support innovative CTE learning by aligning and encouraging partnerships between local schools with businesses and industries that reflect the needs of the community, helping students gain the skills they need to succeed in today’s job market and filling those necessary job openings. 
For more than a year, I have been working to find solutions to reduce premiums and stabilize the individual health insurance market, bringing access to affordable health care to all. While the ACA has been an incredible success for millions of people, helping many access quality health care for the first time in their lives, some are still struggling with premiums and deductibles that are too high. We need to fix that. The longer we wait to act, the higher costs will continue to climb, especially as the Administration and right-wing Republicans in Congress have spent the last year and a half actively working to undermine and sabotage the ACA. Last summer, my Taskforce on Affordable and Accessible Healthcare released Solutions Over Politics and this month endorsed legislation to expand affordability of health insurance, offering constructive solutions to stabilize the marketplace and bring down costs for millions of families. Access to affordable health care is a right, not a privilege, and my focus is on working to make that a reality.
￼
￼
My goal as a legislator has always been to work towards getting to a ‘yes’ on legislation, not a ‘no.’ That requires working with a variety of ideologies and geographies in our great country to find solutions that will help everyone, not just a small, radical few. Unfortunately, in recent years, we’ve seen what happens when you have lacking and poor leadership that seeks to divide rather than unite. It is time for the rank-and-file membership to take back control of Congress so the American people are actually represented. I joined my colleagues in my bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus to reform the way we operate here in the House by empowering rank-and-file members who represent you – not special interests – and put us on a path to finding solutions to the problems that our constituents, our communities, and our economy are facing across the country.

Dear Friends, 
I have exciting news to report. This week the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced it would be opening a primary care facility in Clay County at 400 College Drive in Middleburg.  This is excellent news for our veterans in and around Clay County.
Once the clinic is up and running, it is projected to attract approximately 4,500 new Veterans and serve more than 11,000 Veteran enrollees in the following years. 
This project has been a priority for our team for a long time. In 2016, 2017 and again in February of 2018, we hosted community stakeholders, leaders, and local veterans in the county to make potential bidders aware of the multiple proposals available for this project. 
Despite the first two rounds of VA Requests for Proposals (RFPs) going unanswered, we persisted in garnering support for the project. In February, several proposals for the project were submitted. Those proposals led to this week’s announcement. 
I want to commend all the stakeholders who helped make this happen. There has been such a demand and a need for this facility, and I want to thank the VA for their efforts on this project. 
We cannot do enough for our veterans. I look forward to the increased care and service that will be provided once this clinic is fully operational. While we celebrate this milestone, we still have work to do; we will be working closely with the awardee and the VA in design and planning meetings to make sure we get this to the finish line as quickly as possible. This is a major win for Clay County and the 29,000 Veterans in the region. This is a project that we were not willing to give up on, and we refuse to let this chance slip away.
Sincerely,  
Ted

8/3/18 18:05,My August Newsletter,"￼ 
  

Dear Neighbors,

I hope your August is off to a wonderful start and that you’ll be able to make the most of summer. I’m writing to thank the many of you who made it out to our Opioid Roundtable in Wheaton, as well as my Town Hall meeting in Bensenville, and to update you on my career training bill which was signed into law last week.

On Tuesday, President Trump signed into law my bill, H.R. 2353, the bipartisan Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. This legislation, for which I served as lead sponsor with Republican Congressman Glenn ‘GT’ Thompson of Pennsylvania, reauthorizes and modernizes our career, technical, and vocational education system for the first time in 12 years. Today, two-thirds of Americans don’t have a four-year college degree and while the student debt crisis must end, it’s also essential that we modernize career training programs for Americans who don’t complete a four-year degree. At the same time, our country faces a huge skills gap: 6.5 million jobs in our economy remain unfilled because employers simply cannot find workers with the skills for the positions they require. By modernizing and expanding our career and technical education programs, we can ensure that millions more Americans develop the skills they need to start family-sustaining careers while helping businesses and our economy to grow.

￼
Congressman Krishnamoorthi with Republican Congressman Glenn ‘GT’ Thompson on an official visit to discuss how reforms made under the Congressmen’s new law will benefit the career training facility.

My legislation, which passed the U.S. House and Senate unanimously, increases funding for skills-based and on-the-job training up to $1.3 billion annually, providing high school, post-secondary, and community college students with increased educational opportunities in growing fields such as cybersecurity, advanced manufacturing, and healthcare. Beyond just increasing funding to these programs, the new law reforms them, increasing local control of career and technical education programs while requiring educators to work with local businesses to design curricula focused on the in-demand skills employers are looking for and which will help students start not just a job, but a career. A four-year degree may not be for everyone, but a post-secondary education must be and by modernizing career and technical education, this new law will ensure that these career training programs will be more available to Americans than ever before in our country’s history.

I also wanted to take this opportunity to invite you to the events that we have coming up in the 8th District. I will be holding a town hall with local students on August 8th from 6pm – 7pm at the Beth Tikvah Congregation at 300 Hillcrest Boulevard in Hoffman Estates. This will be a bipartisan conversation on school safety and gun violence prevention with guests State Representative David Harris and Northern Illinois University school shooting survivor Lauren Carr. Please RSVP here and if you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to my office at (847) 413-1959.

I’ll also be holding a forum on climate change with guest WGN Meteorologist Tom Skilling on August 11th from 1pm – 2pm at the Schaumburg Public Library at 130 S. Roselle Road in Schaumburg. We’ll also be joined by special guests that include former Obama White House climate advisor Dr. Don Wuebbles of the University of Illinois-Champaign and Doug Sisterson from Argonne National Laboratory. Please join me for a discussion of this existential issue and RSVP here. 

Finally, we will be honoring our Vietnam Veterans with a pinning ceremony in Elk Grove Village on August 14th from 6pm – 7pm at the Elk Grove VFW Club at 400 East Devon Ave. I encourage any Vietnam Veterans, their relatives, and the families of fallen Vietnam Veterans to join us at this medal pinning ceremony to recognize their service and sacrifice to this country. We will have light refreshments beginning at 5:30pm, and the ceremony will start at 6pm. Please RSVP by filling out this form and you can see more details on Facebook here.

As always, thank you to everyone who has contacted my office to share your concerns or ask for assistance. Please continue to reach out to my staff and me with your questions, thoughts, and concerns.


Warm Regards,

￼
￼
 
Dear  , 
I hope you find these quick updates from the past week insightful.
￼
Naval Submarine Base New London
Hoosiers coming to Eastern Connecticut
Our Navy’s newest Virginia-class fast-attack submarine, the USS Indiana will be making Naval Submarine Base New London its home starting this fall. The submarine’s arrival will bring another 138 military personnel members to Groton and will add to the base’s already high occupancy level.
The USS Indiana is headed to Connecticut now that Electric Boat will be conducting the submarine's “post shakedown” maintenance availability, which is repair work that is done on a submarine after its initial sea trials. That work will help to sustain 250-300 jobs at the shipyard, easing workforce fluctuations and preventing layoffs that were projected earlier this year.
As the Ranking Member of the Seapower subcommittee, I applaud the Navy for granting this key maintenance work to Electric Boat. This decision reflects the value that the Navy places in private shipyards who have been a critical partner in helping to keep up with the demands of our growing submarine force. 
￼
Congressman Courtney and Secretary Richard Spencer at Electric Boat in February
One of the key events leading to this decision was my invitation to Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer to visit the Electric Boat shipyard in Groton earlier this year. During our trip, he was briefed about the potential dip in work and the need to assign repair work in order to avoid costly layoffs. This decision will help sustain key jobs and skills in the Groton shipyard as we prepare for a surge in submarine construction work next year. It also ensures that one of our newest submarines, the USS Indiana, will not face delays before its first deployment.
￼
Congressman Courtney speaking at the Montville American Jobs Center opening
New Job Center in Montville
I recently joined the grand opening of the new Montville American Job Center, one of five full-service job centers located in Connecticut. The center will offer one-stop employment services for employers and job seekers including job search assistance, employment counseling, resume workshops, apprenticeship and training referrals, services for veterans, and services for businesses looking to hire. This center is a direct result of federal funding provided through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, which I helped pass in 2014 as a member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. 
This center could not be opening at a more opportune time for Eastern Connecticut as hiring continues to ramp up and parts of southeastern Connecticut continue to grow at the fastest rate in the state. The Montville jobs center will connect residents to with programs that will help them fill the skills gap, like the manufacturing pipeline programming that is training workers to fill high-tech manufacturing jobs across Eastern Connecticut. The pipeline has already placed more than 1,000 graduates in skilled manufacturing jobs.
￼
Touring a new performing arts space at Mitchell College 
An Arts and Culture Tour in Southeastern Connecticut
Earlier this week, I joined the Southeastern CT Cultural Coalition for an all-day arts tour across the region. We started at the Groton/New London airport to view several magnificent pieces crafted by creative individuals living with cerebral palsy. Thanks again to United Cerebral Palsy of Eastern Connecticut for their terrific work on that project. We then headed over to Mitchell College to check out the newly renovated Flock Theater and Red Barn which is an enormous space offering students flexibility to host many types of theatrical performances including puppetry. 
Then we headed over to Expressiones, a non-profit founded by Guido & Jose Garaycochea that hosts programs to build connections in the community through art and education. The non-profit brings in international artists to guide their bilingual arts programs for low-income families. Our day ended with Writers Block in New London, a non-profit that has hosted the New London youth talent show for almost a decade.
I hope you enjoyed this snapshot of my work, and as always thank you for taking a moment to read my weekly update. If you have any questions or concerns about the information in this newsletter, you can contact me through my website or by calling my Norwich district office at 860-886-0139.

Fighting for investments in infrastructure
I'm proud to have helped secure $950,000 in federal funding for water and wastewater projects in Cowen Public Service District.
This federal grant funding will improve the quality of life for residents by expanding services to the Upper Glade community, promoting public health, protecting our waterways, and promote economic growth.
Investment in southern West Virginia’s water infrastructure is crucial for our rural communities.

Marshall University receives $399,000 in grant money
Marshall University is leading the way in research in our state and community.
The National Science Foundation has granted the university $399,000 in funding to acquire a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope.
I have worked to ensure the National Science Foundation is funded so that all our research institutions can continue to win these highly competitive grants. This grant is one more reason that Marshall University is essential in research development.

Suicide awareness for our veterans is crucial 
I joined the Beckley, Clarksburg and Huntington VA Medical Centers’ at their suicide awareness training event.  Our veterans deserve nothing less than our respect and help in a time of crisis.  We must work to address mental health and remove the stigma from treatment. No one asking for help should ever be ignored, especially our veterans.
I used my role on the House Appropriations Committee to secure $196 million in suicide prevention outreach activities in the Fiscal Year 2019 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill.

8/3/18 17:44,Rep. Grothman Newsletter- Great News for Manufacturing,"￼ 
  

Career and Technical Education
Last week, the House and Senate passed H.R. 2353, the Strengthening CTE for the 21st Century Act, with unanimous bipartisan support. 
This week, President Trump signed the bill into law. This piece of legislation, that I cosponsored and voted for, will help address the nationwide skilled labor shortage, which includes pipe-fitters, welders and manufacturing workers. Wisconsin's 6th district is home to more manufacturing jobs than any other district in the country and this bill will help Americans enter the workforce with the knowledge required to compete for high-skilled, well-paying jobs in multiple sectors, including manufacturing.
I am proud to have been a cosponsor and strong supporter of legislation that helps U.S. citizens and residents in the 6th district acquire the education and skills necessary to take advantage of high-paying job opportunities and perform in today's modernized workforce. Organizations and corporations across the country have taken notice of the Strengthening CTE for the 21st Century Act and are eager to see the positive effects it will have on the nation's workforce.
For a short summary of the bill, please click here.

Secretary Zinke in Wisconsin
Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, visited Wisconsin last Friday and I was proud to show him the beautiful natural resources the 6th district has to offer.
Our first stop was in Sheboygan, where we had lunch with local leaders and volunteers from wildlife conservation groups. We were able to survey Lake Michigan and show Secretary Zinke how much cleaner it is than 20 years ago. However, we still have work to do in order to make sure the lake can be enjoyed for generations to come, which is why I made it clear that I support Great Lakes Restoration Funding.
￼ 
Our next stop was in Theinsville, the town I grew up in (go Highlanders!). We visited the Theinsville Dam and Fishway, where we discussed the Asian Carp problem. Asian Carp is an invasive species that is quickly destroying the natural ecosystem in the Great Lakes. I told Secretary Zinke about a bipartisan amendment that Congressman Mark Pocan (D-Madison) and I introduced last year to try to solve this problem. For more information on the amendment, please click here.

More on Economic Growth
Wisconsin and the United States continue to experience economic success, as highlighted by the second quarter's 4.1% GDP growth and Wisconsin's record low unemployment rates. Wisconsin's labor force reached record highs in June and manufacturing is on the rise across the country with 23,000 manufacturing jobs added in July alone. This spike in manufacturing jobs brings the 19 month total to 836,000 compared to 26,000 in the previous 19 months.  More opportunities are becoming readily available for job seekers, and annual wages and benefits for workers have risen at the fastest rate since 2008 as employers look to fill those new positions. I will continue to support legislation that promotes economic growth throughout the country and within the sixth district.
￼

In the District
Many of you have heard the phrase “August Recess” in connection with Congress and its schedule. I am not exactly sure who came up with that phrase, but I do know that my plans for August do not include a recess.  
This month, you will find me working hard every single day across our community on your behalf. It is a packed schedule of visits to our Main Street businesses, employee roundtables, constituent meetings, updates to our many community and business associations, a second opioid summit, parades, and festivals. It is going to be a great August work month, and I look forward to hopefully seeing you out and about in the great 6th District! 

This week, I met with mayors and county commissioners from DeKalb County. Good communication between federal and local officials is critical and helps all of us serve you better. I look forward to getting together with the North Fulton and East Cobb elected leaders in the coming weeks.  
￼ 
  

  
What a Sweet Treat
I had the great opportunity to visit High Road Ice Cream in Marietta. Started in 2010, High Road began as a great ‘mom and pop’ business. Now, they sell their high-quality ice cream products to food distributors, chefs, and hospitality groups among many other places. In 2017, they were featured as the Cobb Small Business of the Year. One of the unique things about High Road Ice Cream is that virtually all of their ingredients are from Georgia. From the cream to the blueberries and peaches to honey and pecans, High Road is definitely Georgia Grown! Today, High Road employs about 60 people. Thanks to a robust economy with a more favorable tax climate — and of course, because of their delicious ice cream – High Road is expanding and expects to hire another 40 people by early next year. 
￼ 
A special thank you to Nicki, Christian, and Kade for a great tour of High Road Ice Cream. 


Welcome Back to School
As our kids head back to school, I wanted to share with you some of the important steps that have been taken by Congress related to school safety. First, let me commend the leaders with Cobb, DeKalb, and Fulton School systems for their efforts in being so proactive in ensuring that our students and educators have the safest environment possible in which to learn and work. If you have a minute, take a read of this story from the AJC about their efforts. 
Because I want to do all I can to be sure our school systems have the resources they need, I supported The Students, Teachers, and Officers Preventing (STOP) School Violence Act (which passed earlier this year).  
The STOP Act creates a grant program to assist local officers, schools, and students in receiving training and assistance to identify school violence before it happens. This legislation will also bolster reporting systems for threats, foster coordination between law enforcement and school systems, and improve security infrastructure for our schools. Through other measures passed this year, $2.3 billion in resources for mental health care, training, and school safety has been appropriated to protect our children. 


Good News Recap
Tax reform and regulatory relief have provided our nation with incredible economic growth — and that is paying off for American workers and our Main Street businesses. In the second quarter of 2018, the economy grew at 4.1 percent. Over six million American workers have received bonuses or increased retirement contributions, and 642 companies have already given out pay raises. 
Four million Americans are receiving bigger paychecks under the new tax withholding tables. Next year’s “Tax Day” is going to look a lot different and whole lot less stressful for you and your family. Here are a few recent figures on how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is impacting hard working families in the 6th District of Georgia.
	•	A $2,198 average tax cut
	•	9.2% average income tax decrease
	•	$38,822 increase in take home pay over 10 years
	•	$62,729 average increase in take-home pay over 10 years for a family of four
I’d love to hear your tax reform story. Click here to share good news about you or your family as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed earlier this year. 
Despite what you hear, many members of Congress are hard at work to represent you, and I am fully committed to putting our district’s needs and values first in Congress. However, there is still more work to be done. With your voice and your help, we can hold Washington accountable. 
This Congress: 
	•	1,011 bills passed out of committee, which is 316 more than average.
	•	900 bills passed out of the House of Representatives, 257 more than average.
	•	Of those, 219 bills were enacted in to law.
	•	And the vast majority of bills that passed the House did so with bipartisan support.

Celebrating Archie Kelley's 100th Birthday
This week I had the distinct privilege to wish a U.S. Navy hero, Archie Kelley a happy 100th birthday. Captain Kelley served on the USS West Virginia during Pearl Harbor after graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy.  During the attack on Pearl Harbor, the USS West Virginia was hit by seven torpedoes. While Captain Kelley was on board he successfully helped save the ship from sinking after being hit. His brave actions saved the lives of many servicemen.  Olivia and I joined Archie Kelley, along with all of his friends for a birthday celebration to reflect on the vast accomplishments and honors Captain Kelley has earned in his 100 years.

Arizona is home to many veterans that are looking for jobs after honorably serving their country, and this group does a great job of helping them succeed in finding work.

POLICY UPDATE: DEFENSE
Congress is moving forward at a rapid pace to fulfill its constitutional duty to support the men and women who volunteer to defend our country. On July 26, 2018, the House agreed to the conference report for the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This week, the United States Senate also approved the Conference Report. The conference report was developed by a conference committee comprised of select members of the House and the Senate that reconciled the differences between the House-passed and Senate-passed versions. I was honored to be a member of the NDAA Conference Committee this year. The NDAA is an annual bill that authorizes the framework of our national security apparatus, and once signed by President Trump, it will be the first time in 21 years that it has been completed before the end of the fiscal year. But this bill is only one component of Congress’s constitutional duty to raise and support a military.
Once funding for the Department of Defense is authorized, funding must be appropriated through the enactment of a Defense Appropriations bill. This legislation is an annual product of the House Appropriations Committee – of which I am a member – and funds the programs, policies, and operations set forth in the NDAA. On June, 28, 2018, the House passed the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019 (H.R. 6157) in a bipartisan manner. The Senate Appropriations Committee has advanced their version of the bill, and the full Senate is expected to vote on passage later this month.
Both pieces of legislation focus on restoring readiness, increasing capability to combat threats, and support for our defenders. They also provide a 2.6 percent pay raise for our troops and grow our force to levels ready to defend our nation. I am proud to report that both bills make significant investments in Arkansas’s defense industry and acknowledge the important role Arkansas businesses play in supplying our armed forces. These bills also recognize the critical role National Guard and Reserve forces play in our national defense. As a 30-year veteran of the Arkansas Army National Guard, I know firsthand that they are an integral part of our Total Force, and these bills provide robust funding to maintain their operational readiness.
The world around us is quickly changing, and we in Congress are responsible for preparing our military for the threats we face today along with the emerging global threats of tomorrow. I am hopeful that Congress will do our part and  finish its work on this legislation before the fiscal year ends on September 30. Giving certainty and support to our men and women in uniform by providing timely and appropriate funding is of upmost importance; it is our duty. Unfortunately, we have not accomplished this since 2007 – before I was even in Congress. As co-chair of the Joint Select Committee tasked with reforming our flawed budget and appropriations process, I am working to find the solutions necessary to fulfill this fundamental responsibility to our troops.
I was proud to support both the NDAA conference report and the House version of the fiscal year 2019 Defense Appropriations bill. I will continue to work to provide for our common defense.

Dear Friend,
As we head into the weekend, I want to remind you that I’ll be holding another live telephone town hall next Tuesday, August 7 at 6:00 p.m. MT to discuss the many important things happening in Congress and to hear from you. 
￼ 
It’s been quite a summer -- from the crusade to reunite families separated at the border by the Trump administration to the fight to stop Judge Brett Kavanaugh from being confirmed to the Supreme Court, and more. I’m looking forward to hearing your views on all of these issues as we continue fighting to protect our western values; you’ll have the opportunity to ask questions throughout the call. 
To RSVP to participate or stream the event live, visit degette.house.gov/live.  

  
Sincerely, ￼  Diana DeGette Member of Congress

8.3.18 This is How We Can Address Teacher and Principal Shortages
Dear Friend, 
At the start of every school year we see the same headlines about exploding class sizes and districts facing teacher and principal shortages. These shortages plague the whole country, and are often worst in our rural communities, but it's a problem we can solve. When teachers and principals have the tools they need to succeed, they are more likely to stay in their roles and equip students with the necessary skills to thrive in today's economy.
This week, I introduced the Preparing and Retaining Education Professionals (PREP) Act to address the teacher and principal shortages that we are seeing in communities across Virginia and all over the country.
The legislation would expand the definition of ""high need"" districts to allow schools in these areas to access additional support resources, encourage school districts to create partnerships with local community colleges and universities in order to create a pipeline of recruitment of teachers back to those districts, as well as increase access to teacher and school leader residency and training programs so communities can recruit teachers locally. The bill also expands the support for teacher preparation programs at Minority Serving Institutions including Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions and Tribal Colleges to support a diverse and well-prepared educator workforce.  Read more about the bill here >>  This is about addressing a gap in our education system and ensuring students across the country get a quality education, no matter where they live.

Sincerely,
￼
Senator Tim Kaine

8/3/18 17:16,This Week in the Office of Senator Marco Rubio,"￼
This Week in the Office of Senator Marco Rubio 
This week I introduced my Economic Security for New Parents Act, which would give parents the option to pull a portion of their future Social Security benefits to finance paid parental leave. Read my op-ed with Rep. Ann Wagner in USA Today here. Watch my joint press conference with Rep. Wagner here.
￼ 
On CBS This Morning, I discussed my Economic Security for New Parents Act. If we are serious in this country about helping our children, it begins from the day they are born by allowing their parents to be involved in the early days of their lives, especially. And that should not be a bankruptcy-inducing event. Watch the full interview here.
￼ 
On Monday, I spoke on the Senate floor to push for the passage of my bipartisan DETER Act in light of today’s announcement by Facebook that it shut down a disinformation campaign that sought to sow chaos ahead of the 2018 elections. Watch my full speech here.
￼ 
I have never opposed an NDAA, and I have supported every single one of them, despite the fact that they didn't have everything I wanted or everything I liked—until this week. I spoke on the Senate floor about the threat ZTE & Huawei pose to our national security. Watch my full speech here.
￼  
At the Young America’s Foundation 40th Annual National Conservative Student Conference, I spoke about the unique challenges and opportunities young conservatives face in the 21 st century. Watch my full speech here.
￼ 
I spoke at a Senate Intelligence hearing on the threat of foreign influence in social media. My bipartisan DETER Act, works to combat this threat. Watch my remarks here.
￼ 
On Tuesday, the Senate extended the National Flood Insurance Program, which I spoke in support of on the Senate floor last week. Read more here.
￼ 
On Thursday the Senate passed my United States-Israel Security Assistance Authorization Act of 2018. Which I introduced with Senator Coons to strengthen the U.S.-Israel strategic alliance by authorizing foreign military financing for Israel over the next 10 years. Read more here.
￼ 
President Trump signed my American Dream Accounts Act into law, which is legislation I introduced with Senator Coons that will help to increase the number of low-income and at-risk students able to access and complete college or technical education. Read more here.
￼ 
On Wednesday the Senate passed the second FY2019 Minibus appropriations package, which includes key provisions that I advanced which are critical to securing funding for agencies working to address harmful algal blooms, legislation to deny Chinese investors access to U.S. small business aid and to crack down on shell companies using cash transactions in luxury real estate. Read more here.
￼ 
During my meeting with Supreme Court Nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh, he articulated an unwavering commitment to original intent, judicial restraint, and the understanding that the Supreme Court should be a ‘trier of law’ appellate court and not a ‘trier of fact’ trial court. Read more about our meeting here. 
￼
I met President-elect Mario Abdo of Paraguay to discuss security and infrastructure challenges. It is important to strengthen our bilateral relations and the need to continue supporting the role of democracy in the region.

Combating the Opioid Crisis at our Borders
Former Secretary of Homeland Security and Governor of Pennsylvania Tom Ridge highlights in an op-ed how important it is to crack down on synthetic opioids that enter the country through the U.S. Postal Service.
The STOP Act, which I’ve championed and recently passed through the House, would make significant progress in stemming the flow of these dangerous drugs by requiring actionable data to be provided before international mail packages reach our shores. This data will help officials target packages potentially filled with dangerous synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl.
Read more from Secretary Ridge in an op-ed for the Poughkeepsie Journal: https://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/…/closing-po…/788770002/

Upcoming Veterans Resource Fair
On Saturday, August 11th, I’ll be hosting another Veterans’ Resource Fair in Schoharie County to provide veterans an opportunity to access resources they have earned. The fair will take place at the Schoharie County Sunshine Fair and will be located next to the Cobleskill Fire Department Booth.
Representatives from the Schoharie County Veterans Service Office and the Stratton VA Medical Center to provide veterans with resources and guidance. Questions and concerns can be directed to New York 19’s Kinderhook Congressional Office at (518) 610-8133.
More information about the Sunshine Fair, including directions, can be found here: http://www.sunshinefair.org/. 

Protecting Taxpayer Money 
I introduced a bill, the RETILE Act, in response to a report that the state of New York wasted $20 to $30 million in federal taxpayer money by using multi-colored tiles, rather than single-colored tiles, during reconstruction of the Queens-Midtown and Brooklyn-Battery tunnels.
The bill would require tunnel projects using federal funds to utilize single-colored tiles to uphold the integrity of federal taxpayer dollars unless the state seeks a waiver. Every dollar should always be used as efficiently as possible.
When Congress considers federal funding for the state of New York, it pays attention to how money was spent in previous instances. When my colleagues from other states learn about situations such as this, they react negatively, putting future funding at risk.

Groundwood Paper Tariffs will Hurt Communities
Tariffs on groundwood paper, commonly used for newsprint, will hurt the newspaper industry and the communities they serve. People across the United States depend on local newspapers to know what is going on in their communities.   Smaller newspapers already operate on very thin margins, and implementing tariffs on newsprint would threaten their financial viability. These tariffs will not go into effect until the U.S. International Trade Commission considers and votes on the measure later this month.
I have co-sponsored the PRINT Act, which will suspend tariffs on imported groundwood paper commonly used for newsprint. Read more in the Daily Freeman: http://www.dailyfreeman.com/general-news/20180802/us-proceeds-with-tariffs-on-canadian-newsprint

Catskill Forest Festival
This weekend, I had the pleasure of attending the 9th Annual Catskill Forest Festival in Margaretville. The festival features vendors, live music, local foods and beverages, and arts & crafts.
This year, the festival honored the life of Middletown Town Councilman Jake Rosa. Jake tragically lost his life in a January accident. A life-long area resident, Jake was a member of the Board of Directors of the Catskill Forest Association. His life was one of service and commitment to the community.
￼

Visiting Callanan Industries
Callanan Industries, Inc. is a statewide leader in supplying paving materials and construction services. Callanan was founded in 1883, and in 1895 won the first road building contract in New York State.
I was glad to have the opportunity to visit their East Kingston facility with Senator George Amedore to learn more about Callanan’s business. Thank you to Don Fane, President of Callanan, for providing the tour.
￼

Congregation B'nai Israel Celebrates 100 Years
On Sunday, I attended the 100th Anniversary of the Congregation B'nai Israel in Fleischmanns. The anniversary event presented a concert featuring work from prominent Jewish American composers and songwriters in the 100 years since the congregation was established.
The congregation was founded by Jewish farmers and merchants in 1918 and serves the spiritual needs of the central Catskills region.
￼

Cobleskill Regional Hospital
This week, I visited Cobleskill Regional Hospital, part of Bassett Network, to learn more about the healthcare services the hospital provides. It is Schoharie County’s only provider of acute inpatient medical care, short-stay inpatient rehabilitation services, and emergency care. The hospital has a pending application with federal health authorities to designate the hospital as a critical access facility.
Thank you to Hospital President Eric Stein and Vice President Susan Oakes Ferrucci for giving me a tour.
￼

Discussing Nutrition, Visiting Dover Elementary
On Wednesday, I participated in a round table discussion hosted by Dutchess County Cooperative Extension with nutrition and agriculture stakeholders to discuss the farm bill. The Senate this week passed their motion to go to conference and negotiations with the House will begin soon. The discussion centered around the importance of SNAP, dairy initiatives to improve the market conditions for our farmers, and how we can bring more fresh foods and vegetables into households utilizing SNAP benefits.
￼
After the round table, I visited Dover Elementary School to learn more about their Summer Food Service Program. Thank you to Superintendent Michael Tierney, Principal Herman Harmelink, and Food Service Director Carol Jankowski for the tour, and all the staff who make this summer program such a success.
￼

Mohonk Mountain House
The Hotel industry employs over 15,000 people in New York’s 19th congressional district and is responsible for over $1 billion in business sales. One of the most renowned hotels in Upstate New York is the Mohonk Mountain House, which was originally founded by the Smiley Family in 1869.
I visited the resort earlier this week to learn more about the business, and the hotel industry in New York. The resort is surrounded by 40,000 acres of forest and is designated a National Historic Landmark.
￼

4-H Tour at the Ulster Co. Fair
I returned to the Ulster County Fair to visit the Cornell Cooperative Extension and tour the youth building. The building is organized by kids and young adults in the 4-H Youth Development Programs.
This program facilitates hands-on learning experiences and leadership training for our nation’s youth through partnerships with more than 100 public universities across the country.

Rep. Cummings speaks about the importance of Title X Funding
July 23, I was joined by Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, and Representatives Dutch Ruppersberger and John Sarbanes, as well as Baltimore City Health Commissioner Dr. Leana Wen and Mayor Catherine Pugh, at a press conference outlining the harm of potential Title X funding cuts due to the new “gag” rule.
The changes made by this proposed rule would greatly impede women’s access to family planning resources and ensure that low-income women have fewer health care providers to rely upon for comprehensive, quality reproductive care. The Trump Administration is trying to insert itself into one of the most intimate conversations between a patient and health care provider.  This is just another example of the Republican obsession with closing Planned Parenthood, and the Trump Administration’s all-out assault on health care.

Rep. Cummings with roundtable participants
July 27, Senator Elizabeth Warren and I held a roundtable with Maryland Senator Ben Cardin and Congressman John Sarbanes, Baltimore officials, health professionals, and community representatives to discuss the challenges they face in combating the opioid epidemic and the urgent need for new resources to expand treatment.  
Today we heard first-hand how the opioid epidemic is ravaging Baltimore and the nation, and how additional funding is urgently needed to expand access to treatment. This crisis does not discriminate based on politics. It affects red states, blue states, and purple states.  It affects rich families, poor families, and everyone in between – and people are dying across nation.  The bill I introduced with Senator Warren—the CARE Act—is the comprehensive approach we need to address this emergency and provide the resources we need to those who have this disease.

Perkins Homes
During a presentation last year to officials at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, I made the argument for additional funds for affordable housing. I knew that the 7th District relied on grants from initiatives like President Obama's ""Choice Neighborhoods"" program.  The Trump Administration wanted to slash those funds, but Congress decided to increase funding for this program. 
On July 19, HUD announced a $30 million Choice Neighborhoods grant to Baltimore that should help to transform the distressed Perkins Homes public housing project and its surrounding area into a mixed-income neighborhood of choice, both for current residents and new ones.  
Read more about what I am doing for affordable housing. 
Passing Legislation
On July 9, my legislation, the All Circuit Review Act, was signed into law. This law will help federal government employees who face punishment for blowing the whistle on wrongdoing such as health or safety violations or wasteful spending. The new law will allow these employees to file appeals in a court near where they work or where they live.  This will allow whistleblowers to have a more fair chance of making their case because it will mean judges from all over the country can consider appeals rather than only judges in Washington, D.C.

Long’s Short Report – Table Rock Lake Duck boat tragedy  By Rep. Billy Long  On Thursday evening, July 19, news broke of a tragic accident on Table Rock Lake involving an amphibious passenger vehicle known as a duck boat. What was supposed to be a great fun family experience on the lake turned into a nightmare for all involved. The entire region was in shock and in mourning. I did not want to believe the initial reports that stated 11 dead and six missing. The fact a duck boat had sank to the bottom of our own Table Rock Lake was unspeakable. More bad news arrived Friday morning when the death toll rose to 17, with nine of the deceased being from the same family.  I immediately reached out to Branson Mayor Karen Best to offer my full support and let her know that my Springfield, Joplin and Washington, D.C. offices were ready to assist in any capacity that would be helpful. As my staff and I continued to monitor the situation the following days, one thing that became clear was the inconsistent implementation of regulations.  This isn’t the first time duck boats have been involved in a tragic accident. In 1999, a duck boat on Lake Hamilton in Arkansas took on water and sank, resulting in 13 fatalities. Following that accident, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), an independent government investigative agency, suggested a number of recommendations to avoid future accidents. Unfortunately, even after the NTSB’s recommendations, several more duck boat accidents occurred.  Since these boats operate on both land and water, there are multiple agencies that regulate them, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Due to the number of agencies involved, many of the recommended regulations have not been implemented or enforced because conflicting regulations and lack of oversight.  Moving forward, I remain committed to finding solutions and ways to hopefully ensure an accident like this never happens again. I plan to work with all entities involved on a path forward, which means waiting until the NTSB’s preliminary report is released so we can fully understand how this situation occurred.  As the Branson community recovers from this heart wrenching tragedy, I want to thank our first responders, the Red Cross and mental health officials for their continued dedication and service to our community. And a special tip of my hat to Mayor Karen Best and Governor Mike Parson, who both have demonstrated the steady hands of true leaders during this difficult time. My colleagues and l in Washington will not forget the loved ones lost. I am not for legislating off 19-year-old NTSB reports, but once it completes its investigation of what went wrong, I will work tirelessly to ensure this horrific loss of life is not repeated.

The Hill Report   A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions Week of July 30 - August 3, 2018

Our students are the future of our great nation. That is why each year I am delighted to welcome young leaders to Washington for the annual Pete Sessions Leadership and Growth Program (PSLGP). This summer, I hosted 163 students from 42 high schools to see firsthand how government works, learn invaluable leadership skills, and visit historic sights. 
This year, students met with several of my colleagues, including fellow Rules Committee members Congressmen Bradley Byrne, Dan Newhouse, and Ken Buck, Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee Greg Walden, and Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and fellow Texan Michael McCaul, who were generous enough to share their time and insights with these young leaders. I hope that the stories, advice, and encouragement they provided will spur these students on to pursue a life of serving their communities in many different capacities.
￼ 
In addition to PSLGP, I am also proud to have welcomed students from the Today Foundation's Texas Leadership Forum who participated in the American Leadership Institute. Over the course of the week they spent in D.C., these bright young students met with diplomatic officials at the Turkish Embassy as well as several Members of Congress. I am delighted to continue this great tradition and I look forward to next summer’s group. If you would like to learn more about the Today Foundation, click here.  
￼ 
It is truly a privilege to welcome these future leaders to Washington and not only teach them about our nation's democratic process, but also learn and hear from them about the issues they are passionate about. I have no doubt that they will achieve great things in their future and I look forward to seeing the immense impact they make to better our country.

Strengthening Career & Technical Education U.S. Economy Springs to Life House Appropriations Committee Completes Work on All 12 Funding Bills “Rodney Frelinghuysen’s Last Appropriations Markup Hurrah” Worth a Read: “Biz schools hit by China purge on foreign university tie-ups.” Salute: The Reverend Ernie Kosa
 
Strengthening Career & Technical Education
The President signed into law this week bipartisan legislation designed to strengthen and improve career and technical education and give Americans the skills they need to compete for in-demand, 21st Century jobs.
H.R. 2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, reauthorizes the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act. This is the first major overhaul to the program since 2006. 
This is a clear win for America’s workers. We have more than six million unfilled jobs across this nation, due in part to a widening skills gap.  This bill has been a long time coming and will support innovative learning opportunities and strong community partnerships, addressing the problem of vacant jobs and workforce development needs where they exist: at the local level.
For a summary of the bill, please visit.
For more information, please visit.
The House vote in favor of H.R. 2353 was unanimous. 
 
U.S. Economy Springs to Life
If recent history is any indication, there may soon be significantly more demand for skilled U.S. workers.  According to the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly four years in the second quarter of 2018. Learn more here.
The Gross Domestic Product jumped 4.1% for best pace in nearly four years - the fastest rate of the growth since the third quarter of 2014 and the third-best growth rate since the Great Recession of 2008.  In addition to the strong second quarter, the Commerce Department revised its first-quarter reading up from 2 percent to 2.2 percent.
This growth is being driven by the lower corporate taxes and a robust labor market, which created an average of 215,000 jobs per month in the first half of this year.  Unemployment is near an 18-year low, factories are seeing more orders, and exports appear to be surging. 
In addition, compensation for workers rose to a nearly 10-year high in the second quarter. Significant wage gains have been a missing part of the economic recovery, with average hourly earnings increases barely keeping pace with inflation.  Learn more here.
 
House Appropriations Committee Completes Work on All 12 Funding Bills
As I mentioned, The House Appropriations Committee has achieved a great deal so far this year – drafting and approving all 12 bills and getting half of these through the House floor, plus holding more than 70 hearings since February.
Ours is an open and member - driven Appropriations process – holding Member Days to ensure our bills represent the values and priorities of the people we represent, following a long tradition of bipartisanship.
Members have had – and will have – additional opportunities to have their voices heard as we continue to pass bills on the floor and put more of them through House - Senate Conference Committees.
The 12 bills that we have moved through the House fund vital programs across the federal government, including those that bolster our national security and rebuild our Armed Forces, make Americans safer, protect our nation’s resources, and expand our economy and create jobs.
In addition to providing this necessary funding, the bills ensure that the federal government is working more efficiently, and in the best interest of the American taxpayers. This includes streamlining federal agencies, reforming financial policies, and reducing burdensome regulatory red tape.  Here’s a sampling of some of the bills passed by the House during this Appropriations cycle:
	•	For a rundown on the Energy and Water, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and the Legislative Branch Appropriations bills, please visit.

Worth a Read: “Business schools hit by China purge on foreign university tie-ups.” 
The Financial Times writes, that overseas universities face competition from innovative Chinese counterparts.  Read the story here.
 
Salute: A fond farewell to the Rev. Ernie Kosa of Sparta who recently passed away at age 96. A former Army chaplain and longtime volunteer for a variety of causes, Ernie supported such charitable organizations as Sussex County Retired Senior Volunteer Program, Sussex County Mental Health Board, Newton Medical Center and Easter Seals.  But as a veteran of the Korean and Vietnam wars, Kosa retained a special place in his heart for those who have served in the uniform of their nation.  Among his many contributions, he was instrumental in the establishment of a veterans' cemetery in Sussex County. He was a good friend and his wife, Barbara, equally gave her time to support veterans and their families.  Ernie Kosa will be missed but his impact on Sussex County life will be long-remembered.

8/3/18 16:50,They Won’t Get Away with It Again.,"￼
I wanted to share an article I wrote in  USA Today  this week, about Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Although he is a an extremely qualified and capable  individual, the exact kind of person we would want to serve on the United States Supreme Court, the Democrats are trying to smear him and attack his character to detail his confirmation. We won’t allow that to happen. 
I explain more my op-ed below.
To Bork, or not to Bork?
For Senate Democrats, that is the question. 
For those unfamiliar with borking, the term —  officially recognized  by the Oxford English Dictionary in 2002 — refers to the unprecedented campaign of character assassination waged against Judge Robert Bork during his 1987 Supreme Court confirmation hearing. Judge Bork was among the most qualified and credentialed judicial nominees ever to come before the Senate. A giant on the federal bench, his opinions were  never once overruled on appeal . His jurisprudence was unassailable; his character beyond reproach.
￼ 
This week I also gave a floor speech discussing Judge Kavanaugh’s jurisprudence—click here to watch!   
By all accounts, Judge Bork’s confirmation should have been a cakewalk. But it quickly became a political gauntlet from which neither his career nor his reputation would ever recover. 
Rather than evaluate Judge Bork on the merits of his judicial record, Democrats subjected him to a public inquisition, misrepresenting his positions and demonizing his character at every turn. Their ultimate goal was to portray Judge Bork not as the reasoned and principled jurist we all knew him to be, but as a political extremist hell-bent on returning America to a racist, reactionary past.
And in large part, they succeeded. Judge Bork’s nomination was eventually defeated. Never mind that the reputation of a decent and honorable man lay in tatters — liberals had claimed their first scalp in the full-scale politicization of the Supreme Court confirmation process.
So vicious and low was the left’s treatment of the good judge that a description of this behavior found its way into the everyday parlance: to Bork. To  Bork public officials  is to vilify them for political gain. It is to strip them of their humanity, tear their public image to shreds, and depict them as evil incarnate. It is to do to a person exactly what Democrats are attempting to do to Judge Brett Kavanaugh. 
Like Judge Bork, Judge Kavanaugh is among the  most qualified individuals  ever nominated to the Supreme Court. With a sterling academic résumé, a demonstrated commitment to the Constitution and more than 12 years on the federal bench, he is everything Americans could hope for in a Supreme Court justice. Democrats know they can’t derail Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination on the merits. Instead, they attack a straw man — a gross caricature of the real Judge Kavanaugh, a fictitious being born of rank hyperbole and liberal lies. 
In their zeal to portray Judge Kavanaugh as the embodiment of our greatest fears, Democrats have gone borking mad. As if announcing a professional wrestling match, Sen. Richard  Blumenthal described Judge Kavanaugh as nothing less than “your worst nightmare.” Sen. Kamala  Harris went a step further when she warned that Kavanaugh’s confirmation would result in the “destruction of the Constitution of the United States.” But Sen. Jeff  Merkley one-upped them all when he stated, with no hint of irony, that Judge Kavanaugh ""is a nominee who wants to pave the path to tyranny.”
In a moment of indiscretion, it seems that President Donald Trump has nominated Genghis Khan to the Supreme Court.
In recent days, liberal rhetoric has taken an even more apocalyptic turn. Take, for example,  the letter  signed by hundreds of Yale Law School alumni,  students and faculty prophesying that “people will die if (Judge Kavanaugh) is confirmed.”
Or consider Sen. Cory  Booker’s declaration that anyone supporting Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination is “complicit (in) evil” — or his biblical allusion likening this political moment to “walking through the valley   of the shadow of death .”
Given the rhetoric, you’d be forgiven if you thought the left was talking about the Grim Reaper and not Judge Kavanaugh. While both might wear black robes, only one is a minivan-driving carpool dad. Only one is a baseball-loving law professor adored by students of all political stripes. Only one is a former altar boy turned girls basketball coach who feeds the homeless in his free time. And that’s Judge Kavanaugh.
Try as they might to depict my friend as the harbinger of death, Democrats are repeatedly frustrated by the same simple fact: Judge Kavanaugh is an incredibly decent human being. 
I know from firsthand experience. Judge Kavanaugh and I became well acquainted when he was nominated to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2003. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time, I oversaw every step of his confirmation. Throughout the process, Judge Kavanaugh proved himself to be an individual of exceptional kindness, character and compassion. The judge I know personally is nothing like the cartoon villain the left makes him out to be.   
Political operatives can dehumanize Judge Kavanaugh all they want in the media. But at the end of the day, this is the same man who, every year, takes the little girl of his widowed friend to the  school daddy-daughter dance . It’s the same man who has championed the  professional success of women  and minorities throughout the entirety of his legal career. And it’s the same man who has garnered widespread admiration from jurists and academics on both sides of the political aisle.
In an attempt to make a monster of a mensch, Democrats have dumped  millions of dollars on political ads  maligning Judge Kavanaugh’s character. But the truth, like Teflon, keeps these attacks from sticking.  
Of course, reality won’t deter Democrats from further attempts to Bork Judge Kavanaugh.
Mother Theresa could be our nominee, and the left would still find something to complain about. Even so, I trust the American people to see through the ruse. Judge Kavanaugh is both a gentleman and a jurist of the highest quality. He is an eminently qualified nominee who deserves swift confirmation to the Supreme Court.
Sincerely, 
Orrin

Preparing American Workers for Success
This week, President Trump signed H.R. 2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act into law.  I supported this bill because it will provide Hoosier workers with the skills they need to succeed in tomorrow's economy. 
Career and technical education provides the knowledge and skills required to enter the workforce and succeed.  With this new law, we ensure that every American is capable of working and providing for themselves and their family.  There are currently over six million unfilled jobs in this country and closing the skills gap will allow hard-working Americans to fill those jobs.
H.R. 2353 gives power back to local and state leaders to align the skills being taught in continuing education programs to local market demand and increases transparency and accountability.  This will allow career and technical education to improve, grow, and help Americans find jobs and have rewarding careers.
House Passes Medical Device Repeal
Last week, the House voted to pass the Protect Medical Innovation Act of 2018, which repeals the sales tax on medical devices.  The medical device industry is an important one for Hoosiers.  It generates over $10 billion in economic activity for Hoosiers every year and provides jobs for over 20,000 people.  Indiana is one of the largest states in percentage of medical technology industry employment.
While the medical device tax is a part of Obamacare, in the past, we have successfully delayed implementation of this tax several times.  But now we must provide doctors and patients with the certainty that only a permanent repeal can give.  In 2012, I led a letter that 74 of my Congressional colleagues signed asking House leadership to support a full repeal of this tax.  Last year, I offered an amendment to the tax reform bill that would have repealed the tax as well.  We need to permanently end this tax once and for all.
Fixing Social Security Disability Insurance

As Vice Chair of the House Budget Committee, I am working to rein in Washington's spending problem.  We need to reform government programs to ensure that they work without wasting taxpayer dollars.  Recognizing this, I have introduced H.R. 6532, the Making D.I. Work for All Americans Act.
This bill would reform the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program to save it from insolvency.  The changes that I propose would make the program more efficient, transparent, and accountable.  One reform would allow the Social Security Administration (SSA) to reduce fraud by considering social media activity when making a disability determination.

This bill has the support of Heritage Action, a leading policy analysis organization.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to produce national reform that ensures disabled Americans are better served, while also protecting taxpayers.

Rokita Reading - School Choice
As Americans, we are blessed to live in a country that gives us the freedom to choose what we think is best for ourselves and our families.  This freedom must be extended to our children's education.  Whether you want to send your child to a different school for better discipline, dress codes, or an emphasis on teaching traditional or religious values, it is a decision for families and not government to make.
In his article the Moral Logic of School Choice, Former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal makes the case for parents being able to decide what is best for their child's education. Living in the best country in the world means that all of our children should have access to the best education.  Charter authorizations, vouchers, and education tax credits give parents who would normally have to send their child to an under-performing school, the ability to send them elsewhere.  When parents have a choice, kids have a chance.  This instills competition for pupils and dollars in turn forcing public schools to improve themselves, this benefits everyone.
Jindal summarizes by saying that “the government gives parents wide leeway to make choices about their children’s health, diets and religious practices.  Regulators interfere narrowly only in extreme cases to prevent permanent harm, and even then parents have recourse to the judicial system.  Shouldn’t parents get the same respect when deciding how their children should be educated?”

Dear Lindsey, 
On Tuesday, I was pleased to announce with Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan and Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter that the Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC) has awarded federal grant funds to development projects throughout the Granite State. The NBRC has been an essential player in spurring growth and opportunity in rural communities throughout New Hampshire, and these grants will bolster education and workforce training, recreational programming, healthcare services, and our affordable housing stock, all of which are vital to the economic development of our state. I will continue to work across the aisle to strengthen this critical program and ensure rural and underserved communities in New Hampshire get the support and resources they need to thrive and prosper.
Enhancing Career and Technical Training Programs 
I welcome the signing into law of the bipartisan Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, which was featured on my Jobs and Opportunity Agenda. We need an all of the above approach to expanding economic opportunity for individuals and families across the Granite State, and that means improving access to apprenticeship and vocational programs, addressing the out of control cost of higher education, and strengthening public-private partnerships to foster small business growth. This law will help enhance career and technical training programs, particularly in rural areas, and it will increase the amount of federal funds that states can set aside to assist eligible students in rural communities. I’m thrilled Congress came together to draft this bill and send it to the President for signature, and I will keep up my efforts to ensure all Granite Staters can succeed and get ahead.

Promoting Public Health and Safety 
We know that lead paint represents a serious risk to people in the Granite State, particularly young children. With a housing stock that spans decades and in many cases centuries, it is critical that programs exist to raise awareness and ensure best practices are used when renovating properties with lead paint. The $40,000 federal grant New Hampshire received this week from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will support important efforts underway in New Hampshire to promote public health and safety. It is a step in the right direction, and I will continue working to protect the wellbeing of all Granite Staters. 
A Thoughtful Approach to Trade 
Last weekend, I wrote an op-ed in the New Hampshire Union Leader about my concern that President Trump’s haphazard approach to trade will cost jobs in New Hampshire and hurt consumers. Granite State workers and businesses need the White House to exercise a more thoughtful approach to trade and work to expand opportunities for Americans to do business abroad, not engage in a race to the bottom. I’m encouraged that talks with the European Union appear to be moving forward, but we also need to normalize relations with Canada and Mexico, New Hampshire’s two largest trading partners, to achieve our common goals. The long-term prosperity of New Hampshire’s workforce and economy are at stake. Read my full op-ed here.  
Serving You 
My biggest responsibility in Congress is to serve you, the people of New Hampshire’s Second Congressional District.

Tax Cuts
This week we learned that the Trump Administration is planning another tax cut on top of the $1.5 TRILLION tax cut he gave the richest Americans last year. Now, Trump is floating a $100 BILLION regulatory maneuver that would further reduce their taxes, a proposed change in the capital gains tax. This is money paid when investments are sold at a profit and it is already taxed at a much lower rate than the income tax most working people pay. The administration’s proposal bypasses Congress completely and is therefore a legally questionable approach. The Constitution gives Congress the authority to “lay and collect Taxes”. Where is the President’s plan to help Americans dealing with higher health care and housing costs, struggling to afford college and put healthy food on the table? This is an outrageous and irresponsible drain on the federal budget. There is just no end to their efforts to redistribute wealth to those who need it the least.
Quiet Skies
I am greatly concerned about a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) program, “Quiet Skies” recently detailed in the Boston Globe. Many questions have been raised about a program under which thousands of innocent Americans were put under surveillance for the flimsiest of reasons.  This surveillance appears to have continued after a passenger exited the terminal to the airport curb, which also allowed air marshals to record who picked up innocent Americans at the airport.
I wrote the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General demanding he conduct an audit of the “Quiet Skies” program, evaluating its compliance with the law, impact on personal privacy and overall effectiveness.
I am asking the IG to specifically answer the following questions:
·         Was any analysis done of the program’s privacy impacts and compliance with privacy laws?  Was any attempt made to minimize those privacy impacts? If so, how is that being accomplished?
·         To what extent were legal implications considered in setting up a surveillance program targeting individuals not actually on any watch list or suspected of illegal activity?
·         Does the Quiet Skies program have an established list of goals and metrics it aims to achieve?
·         Is the Transportation Security Administration evaluating whether those goals are being met?
·         Has the program proven effective under the Transportation Security Administration’s own metrics or when evaluated against other programs?
·         Did the Transportation Security Administration evaluate the program in comparison to other uses of their limited funding and decide that this was the best use of funds? 
The TSA plays an important airport safety role but the “Quiet Skies” program raises some concerning questions about privacy and legality.
J Street
I met this week with J Street to talk about the importance of a sustained peace process to seek a two state solution to the tragic conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. J Street, which defines itself as “pro-Israel and pro-peace”, is also deeply concerned about the Trump administration’s reckless approach to Iran.  They recognize that Iran must not become a nuclear power. Diplomacy and concerted multi-lateral action, not bellicose tweets, would be a wiser approach, and one more likely to be effective. Conflicts between our two countries could escalate quickly. We also talked about efforts to halt the Netanyahu government’s demolition of Palestinian villages in the West Bank, which J Street fears will make creation of a viable Palestinian state unlikely if not impossible.  J Street asked me to continue insisting that our Constitution gives to Congress and Congress alone the authority to declare war or commit United States troops to combat operations. We had a thoughtful and productive exchange, and I appreciate their time and their commitment to negotiation and diplomacy. 
American Jewish Committee
I also met with members of the American Jewish Committee (AJC) this week. They impressed me with their concern for immigrants and refugees.  They sought my help to preserve Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which the Trump administration is systematically revoking. TPS is a legal status given to immigrants from countries ravaged by civil conflict or natural disaster and to which it may still be too dangerous to return. Many of these persons have lived in the United States for years, putting down roots, contributing to their communities and raising families, many of which include U.S. citizen children.  Once more, the Trump administration has no hesitation in ripping families apart. I assured them I would do all in my power to help. They also suggested the United States work with the Organization of American States (OAS) to address the root causes of migration from South and Central America, poverty, crime, and lack of good governance.  They asked my support for some pending bills, H. R. 1221, the International Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace Act of 2017, to support people-to-people peace initiatives, and H. R. 1911, to create a Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism world-wide. I am already a member of the House Anti-Semitism Task Force and have been concerned, as the AJC has been, by the deeply troubling resurgence of this hateful prejudice in many places, including Western democracies, even our own. We all recall with horror the neo-Nazi outrages in Charlottesville, Virginia, last summer and President Trump’s shameful equivocation in their aftermath. It was encouraging to meet with such good citizens, and I am grateful for their commitment to the rights of all persons.   
Behind the Curtain – More House and Trump Administration Actions You Don’t Want to Miss
Here are this week’s additions. If you need to catch up or share with friends, you can find the full list here.
338:     According to July 2018 media reports, the Trump administration’s Department of the Interior will no longer require energy companies drilling for oil to repair any damage they do to public lands during this process. Until now, companies seeking to drill on land owned by the federal government were required to provide compensation for any destruction caused by their activities. This administration has shown repeatedly that they are more interested in prioritizing business interests over environmental concerns.
339:     In July 2018 Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) announced that they filed a Freedom of Information request with the General Services Administration (GSA) requesting all communication with White House officials regarding plans for the FBI headquarters. Last year, the White House abruptly cancelled plans to move the headquarters despite the fact that the process was already fairly far along. The current plan is to renovate the existing headquarters, which is located near the Trump hotel in D.C. Questions have been raised about Trump’s motive for cancelling the FBI move, including speculation that he did it to avoid another hotel being built on the site of the existing headquarters, creating more competition for his hotel. Now Trump is apparently taking an active interest in what the renovated FBI headquarters will look like since it is so close to his own property. The GSA has also raised concerns that simply renovating the building won’t adequately account for security requirements. CREW’s documents request should shed light on the behind the scenes maneuvering over the FBI headquarters. 
340:     According to a July 2018 New York Times report, the need for affordable housing is escalating with far too many people devoting too much of their monthly income to rent. Affordable housing construction is not keeping up with the need and rents are rising. While the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HDU) defines cost-burdened families as those who spend more than 30% of their income on housing, the Times reports that millions of households today are paying over 70% of their income just on housing leaving next to nothing for life’s other necessities, let alone planning for retirement or their children’s futures. The Trump administration’s answer to addressing this crisis? Shrinking the HUD budget which already doesn’t cover 4 out of the 5 households whose incomes would qualify them for HUD’s programs, and raising rents on the lowest income tenants currently receiving federal assistance. This is not a solution or a plan to address the growing affordability crisis – it is making life measurably worse for too many low income families. 
What’s up Next Week
The House is currently in a District Work period. The next House votes will occur on Tuesday September 4th.

Dear Lindsey, 
Cheri on Shift

Congresswoman Bustos learning about the production of eyeglass lenses at Maui Jim in Peoria
This week, I participated in two Cheri on Shifts to hear directly from hardworking men, women and job creators across Illinois about what’s on their minds. On Monday, I visited J.L. Clark, a packaging company in Rockford, where I had the opportunity to learn more about packaging production and inspection. Then, on Tuesday, I stopped by Maui Jim headquarters in Peoria to work in the prescription lab and learn about the production of eyeglass lenses from start to finish. Since being in Congress, I have now completed 65 Cheri on Shifts and I will continue to seek out these opportunities to learn firsthand how our businesses can grow and strengthen our local economy.

Investing in Peoria’s Airport 
￼
Congresswoman Bustos visiting the Peoria International Airport 
Yesterday, I announced that the Greater Peoria Airport Authority received $1,500,000 in grant funding from the Department of Transportation with Senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth. The funding will go towards completing the rehabilitation of the General Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport apron. Specifically, it will rehabilitate 30,920 square yards of the existing terminal apron pavement that has reached the end of its useful life. Investments such as these are essential in bringing new economic opportunities to our region and I’m proud to help announce federal funding for Peoria’s airport. Read more about my announcement by clicking here.

Senator Maggie Hassan  
See below for highlights of my week fighting for the priorities of Granite Staters.
Visit my website for more updates at Hassan.Senate.Gov. 

This Week: Strengthening our Country’s Cybersecurity

It is clear that in order to protect our nation, we must continue to invest in cybersecurity efforts. Recent reports have shown that Russian hackers have attacked U.S. electric utility companies – the latest examples of the threats we face every day. 
To better protect against cyberattacks, I introduced a bipartisan bill with Senator Rob Portman of Ohio this week to bolster cybersecurity efforts at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). 
This bill will make permanent existing cyber response teams at DHS that work to help prevent cyberattacks on federal agencies and the private sector, as well as help mitigate the impact of such attacks when they occur. The bipartisan bill also encourages collaboration between the federal government and the private sector – leveraging the expertise of both the public and private sectors to bolster our nation’s cybersecurity. It’s critical that we protect our nation from cyber threats and I will keep working across the aisle to move this bill forward. Read more about our bill here. 
I was also pleased that the Senate this week unanimously passed another measure I have supported to strengthen our country’s cyber defenses. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Small Business Cybersecurity Act will provide a consistent set of resources for our innovative small businesses, which are increasingly becoming targets for cyberattacks that threaten their livelihood and the privacy of their customers. I urge President Trump to sign this bill without delay so that we can help ensure that our small businesses have the support and resources they need to protect against such attacks. 
As part of our efforts to ensure that our country is safe, secure, and free, I voted this week to approve the final National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, which includes critical New Hampshire priorities and makes important investments to improve our national security. Read more about how this bill will support New Hampshire and our country here. 
This week, President Trump signed into law a bipartisan bill that will strengthen and extend career and technical education programs in New Hampshire and across the country.
I worked to help craft and advance this bill through the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee because I have witnessed firsthand how important career and technical education programs are to our businesses, economy, and people in our state. 
Now, it is critical that President Trump’s administration implement this law as quickly as possible in order to meet the needs of our businesses and expand economic opportunity for hard-working Granite Staters. Read my op-ed about the importance of this legislation here. 
In February, the Office of Government Ethics approved a concerning fund that was created to help pay the legal expenses incurred by members of President Trump’s administration and campaign staff who are involved in the ongoing investigation into Russia’s attacks on the 2016 election.
Numerous outside experts have condemned the Office of Government Ethics guidance, and my colleagues and I agree. This week, we sent a letter to the new director of the Office of Government Ethics, calling on him to review this problematic fund. Read more about the letter here. 
This week marked the 53rd anniversary of President Johnson signing Medicaid and Medicare into law. I spoke on the Senate floor about how important it is to keep fighting to protect and strengthen these programs for years to come.   
￼ 
Watch my floor speech here. 
We can’t stop fighting for health care. Last summer, your stories and your advocacy helped fight off a Trumpcare bill that would have stripped away health care from millions of Americans. But the fight hasn't stopped -- the Trump Administration has continued its efforts to sabotage our country's health care system. Read my refresher on how here, and help me fight back by submitting your health care story here.

Dear Friend:
I am thrilled that it is now August, which means time for me to spend here in Colorado visiting with many of you. The month has kicked off with nonstop local events and meetings. As always, I appreciate the opportunity to bring you this quick update. 
￼
 U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman welcomes HUD Secretary Carson to Aurora, Colorado
On Monday, I welcomed the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary, Dr. Ben Carson, to Aurora. The Secretary stopped here in my hometown to visit the Village at Westerly Creek. The Village at Westerly Creek is a newly built low income housing complex that is a mix of affordable rental units for the elderly and for families. The Aurora Housing Authority developed the project and HUD provided critical financial support for its construction.   As all of us who are living in Colorado's front range know, our state's economic boom has resulted in a rapidly growing population. Unfortunately, the available housing has not kept up with the growth. Some of the reasons the supply of new homes, condominiums and apartments has not kept up with demand include, state laws such as the “Construction Defects” one that has hampered lower priced condominium development, increasing costs for building permits and utility hook ups, and a shortage of available construction workers.   The Village at Westerly Creek cost about $50 million to construct with federal tax credits from HUD covering about half of that cost. I think programs such as this one that make rents affordable are essential to helping families get on their feet financially and to ensure elderly citizens on limited fixed incomes can live independently. This is why I co-sponsored H.R. 1661 the ‘Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act of 2017’ to update and expand the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program.  
￼
 Immigration Naturalization Ceremony in Aurora, CO on 8/2/18

Unfortunately, much of our immigration system is broken. However, this past Thursday, I participated in an event that symbolizes what does work: the naturalization process. I helped welcome 72 new U.S. Citizens to our community held at the Aurora Municipal Center. These new citizens were from 35 different countries. All of them took the oath of loyalty to our country and I was proud to welcome them as 'our newest citizens'. As you may know, I have been a proponent of modernizing and reforming our current immigration system. I believe that we must secure our borders, show compassion by always keeping families together, and have immigration policies that will help our economy to grow without undermining wages. 
Finally, I wanted to invite you to a tele/web town hall I will host next Monday, August 6, 2018 at 6:30pm MT. This interactive and on-the-go platform enables me to connect with thousands of residents from this congressional district. I will discuss issues facing our community, state and nation with you. Please RSVP by clicking HERE.  I invite you to follow me on Facebook or Twitter to get the latest news as they happen. Likewise, you can find all the latest news on my website. I look forward to seeing you around the district!

Congressman Flores Statement on July Jobs Report 

 
U.S. Representative Bill Flores (R-Texas) issued the following statement regarding the July jobs report released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics:

""The July jobs report shows steady employment growth as well as an increase in take home pay over the last year. The unemployment rate continues to drop, and we saw strong continued domestic economic growth from last week’s GDP numbers. These solid indicators show that our bold, pro-growth tax reform and regulatory reform are in fact working to build a sustainable and durable 21st century economy that will continue to improve the lives of hardworking American families.""

Friends,  
  
I am happy to be home this month traveling throughout the Big First to host meetings and coffees with Kansans.  My schedule will be packed full of community coffees, events, and roundtable meetings across the district. In addition to my 18 different community coffees, I’ll be touring manufacturing facilities, meeting with small business owners and discussing the need for continued advocacy of the ethanol and agriculture industries. 
  
My stops will also include a tour of conservation practices by Flint Hills ranchers and an update on the rebuilding efforts following the Starbuck Fire that burned hundreds of thousands of acres in Western Kansas. 
  
Another exciting stop will be at Fort Riley to celebrate Victory Week. I look forward to touching base with officials there, as well as participating in the barbeque with soldiers.  Later on, during my trip, I will be visiting Smith Center Hospital and continuing conversations on the state of our broken health care system.  
  
And you bet I’ll be enjoying some time at local events like the Phillipsburg Rodeo Parade, the Jetmore Historical Society Vietnam Veteran Project, Ellsworth Cow Town Parade, Lincoln County Post Rock Festival Parade, a VFW Event, and more.
  
Over the next four weeks, I will be traveling more than 2,500 miles, touching every corner of the Big First District, and I’m looking forward to seeing you on the road. 
 ￼ 
￼
￼
￼
Join Me for Coffee
￼ 
This month I will be traveling 2,500 miles across the Big First district to host conversations with YOU! I was elected to be your microphone in Washington, and I look forward to being back in Kansas this month where I can sit down with constituents and hear your stories and better learn what issues are most important to you. We’ll be hosting 19 community coffees all across the district. (see the graphic below for times and places)
We have accomplished a lot this year, but there is more work to be done. I am laser focused on helping Kansans and finding solutions, and your input is so valuable in these efforts.

Celebrating our 35th Anniversary
This week my wife Laina and I celebrated our 35th anniversary.  
It’s hard to believe we’ve been married for 35 years.  
￼
As I reflected on our marriage, I kept thinking of the song, “Stand by Me,” and how Laina has always “stood by me,” by us, by our family, no matter what. We met in November 1982, and that was it, she was the only woman I’ve thought about since. We were engaged February 14, 1983, and married by July 30th that same year.  We both wanted a special honeymoon, so we painted houses as a third job to save money for our trip to Jamaica. When we got back, Laina had agreed to (stand by me) as we fulfilled a commitment to help lead a church at Bull Shoals, Arkansas for a week. Then, (she stood by me) and we started medical school the next day.  
Along came children, OB-GYN residency, moving to Great Bend, and being on call every day or every other day for 25 years. And again, she always stood by me. We both had envisioned “cutting back” in our 50s, but after feeling called to help change the direction our Country, she supported me and our journey for Congress, always “Standing by me.” 
I hope and pray for another 35 years of bliss, happiness, and health. I’m so blessed, to have married the most beautiful person I ever met, the only one I’ve ever loved.

Dear Friends, 
On Monday, I attended the swearing-in ceremony of Robert Wilkie as the 10th secretary of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). I am confident that he is the right leader to help move the department away from problems of the past and toward solutions of the future by implementing the legislation we have passed to address significant problems confronting the VA. 
￼
President Trump also announced the nomination of James Gfrerer to be assistant secretary of the VA for Information and Technology (IT). This Senate-confirmed role oversees a number of critical projects at the VA, including the massive electronic health records merger, a new system to support the expanded VA caregivers benefits, and other IT priorities. Having permanent leadership in place to oversee these projects and the VA’s various information technology systems will be critical as Congress works with the VA to address concerns and make improvements to bring VA into the 21st century. I look forward to meeting with Mr. Gfrerer and learning more about his background and vision for accomplishing these important tasks.   Continuing to Fight for Veterans   As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, I am extremely proud of the Senate’s efforts to improve services for our nation’s veterans in 2017-2018 including the passage of 18 major pieces of veterans’ legislation - all of which have been signed into law - that reform the VA and strengthen veterans’ health care, benefits and services. Additionally, the Senate has confirmed 14 nominees to the VA and the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims to ensure strong leadership is in place to oversee the implementation of these reforms.   We owe our veterans a VA that is responsive to them and their individual needs, and I’m proud to be a part of such a bipartisan, productive committee. I look forward to continuing our efforts by working with my colleagues in Congress, President Trump and newly installed VA Secretary Robert Wilkie to meet these challenges head on and transform the VA into a department worthy of our veterans.
I penned an op-ed that was featured in the Military Times highlighting these legislative victories, and you can read it online here.  An Outstanding Georgia Judge  On Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Georgian Britt Grant to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta by a vote of 52-46.  Throughout her legal career, whether it was practicing as an attorney or serving as a judge, Britt Grant was always at the top of her class. Justice Grant is an outstanding jurist and has served our state with distinction and integrity in role on the Georgia Supreme Court and as solicitor general in the Georgia attorney general’s office. I’m proud the Senate has confirmed Britt Grant to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.  Prior to the vote on her confirmation, I delivered remarks on the Senate floor on Monday to urge my colleagues to support Grant’s nomination. 
￼
Protecting Georgia’s Workers and Consumers  On Wednesday, I cosponsored bipartisan legislation to prevent the U.S. Department of Commerce from unilaterally imposing tariffs on imported cars, trucks and auto parts. Before tariffs could be implemented, the Automotive Jobs Act of 2018 would require the International Trade Commission to conduct a comprehensive study of the wellbeing, health and vitality of the U.S. automotive industry and deliver the report to Congress. I’m actively engaged in the debate on the use of tariffs. I’ve written the administration, questioned members of the cabinet and shared my concerns with the president that we must have a good strategy to reach our trade goals. Anytime the rules of the game start changing, it makes it challenging for businesses to decide to expand and invest. Businesses could be forced into tough choices that may be unnecessary. The proposed tariffs on autos would be a setback to an industry in our state that has provided more than 7,000 new jobs in the last five years alone. I am eager to do everything possible to ensure that we address unfair trade policies by certain global actors, like China, while protecting American workers and consumers.  In Other News
	•	This week, the Senate continued our regular appropriations process to fund the government. We passed legislation that will help in a number of areas, including our national economy, financial security, government accountability, our interior lands and agriculture. Additionally, it would advance the rebuilding of America’s infrastructure and bolster our fight against opioid abuse.
	•	On Tuesday, President Trump signed into law the bipartisan Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. This legislation reauthorizes the Perkins career and technical education program and aligns education and workforce training programs together. President Trump has made improving technical and career education a priority, and I’m pleased that he’s signed this bill into law to give states and local school districts more flexibility to meet the needs of their students by preparing them for in-demand jobs and skills that will benefit them for life.
	•	On Wednesday, the John S. McCain 2019 National Defense Authorization Act passed the U.S. Senate by a vote of 87-10 to strengthen our national security, modernize our all-volunteer military, give them a pay raise, and invest in our future. Congress has again stepped up to support our warfighters and their families with the resources they need to protect America and our national interests. Our Georgia military installations will see the benefits of this legislation firsthand, and I’m proud that we have passed this critical legislation, and that we have a president who is eager to sign it into law.
	•	On Wednesday, the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs held a hearing on pending Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) legislation on health and benefits, including the “Blue Water Navy” legislation dealing with veterans’ exposure to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. 
￼
What’s on Tap?
Next week, the Senate will have a state work period. I look forward to being in Georgia and to attending a meeting of the Statewide Opioid Task Force in Augusta, Ga., on Thursday. When the Senate returns on August 15, we expect to continue working on confirming judges and other presidential nominees to positions that require Senate approval.

I Want to Hear From You
 
During my trips back and forth to the Fifth District, I’ve heard from many people worried about the tariffs. Farmers and business leaders have expressed their concerns. I’ve visited with farmers in the Higginsville community and invited the Canadian Consul, John Cruickshank, to answer some of their questions.

The issue isn’t going away, in fact, I think there are others out there whom I haven’t heard from. Small contractors and others who help keep these larger industries flowing smoothly are worried about their future because of the tariffs.

I want to hear from you, if I haven’t already. Tell me how the tariffs are affecting your business, whether they may impact your supply line or ability to reach and maintain a presence in foreign markets, and how do you think Congress can help. 
 
On my website, you can fill out a survey at; https://cleaver.house.gov/serving-you/trade-survey. If you do not wish to fill out the survey online, you can contact my office.  

President Trump imposed tariffs on products from the European Union, Canada, China, and Mexico. In retaliation, those countries imposed tariffs on U.S. goods. In addition to the direct impacts of tariffs on American-made goods which businesses want to sell in overseas markets, tariffs can have negative effects on the price of goods for American consumers. We are already seeing the effects of tariffs with manufacturers forced to make lay-offs and companies moving overseas.

Reports from the White House say there are plans for a $12 billion emergency aid to help farmers caught in the trade war, but farmers have said they want “trade not aid”. They want to bale not take a “bail out”. They already have mother-nature to contend with - the uncertainty of the weather. Just this week, the USDA designated 19 Missouri counties as primary natural disaster areas due to the recent drought.

Tariffs are another added headache for many farmers who are already struggling. I want to hear from those who are dealing with this.

Warmly,
￼

ABOUT    |     CONTACT    |     ISSUES    |     MEDIA    |     SERVICES 
Dear Friend,
This week, the Trump Administration announced their plans to roll back current fuel emissions standards and revoke California’s waiver, granted under the Clean Air Act, which has allowed our state to strengthen clean air protections. Continuing former Administrator Scott Pruitt’s relentless attacks on our environment, the EPA now seeks to undo federal rules limiting emissions related to climate change. 
Congress cannot allow an Administration that I believe is unwilling to accept the realities of climate change, roll back the progress our state has made to improve public health and reduce harmful emissions.
California is proof that innovation and sustainability go hand-in-hand with economic success. Just last month, California announced that greenhouse gas emissions dropped 13% since they peaked in 2004 and in that same period our economy grew by 26%.
As your Representative in Congress, I want to hear directly from you on this important issue. Do you support the Administration’s decision to weaken current fuel emissions standards? 
￼

Following the Administration’s announcement, I joined of 60 my colleagues in Congress to introduce a resolution (H.Con.Res 130) to oppose this decision. H.Con.Res 130 expresses support for the existing federal clean car standards and states’ right to adopt California’s more stringent standards.   The Central Coast is already experiencing major climate change impacts like wildfires and drought. We can save lives, property, and money when we work to proactively mitigate these increasingly destructive events.  I believe we cannot afford inaction on the most significant challenge of our time.  Sincerely, 
￼

News from Representative Gary Palmer
￼
Dear Friend, 
My staff and I have appreciated seeing so many of you in Washington this summer. I hope your visits to our nation’s Capitol building were enjoyable and informative. It has been a busy summer for the staff and me, and I’m now looking forward to some time to reconnect with many of you in the Sixth District during the August district work period. Here are some updates on what the staff and I have been working on over the summer.        Thanks for reading,  Gary Palmer  

LEGISLATIVE NEWS 
 Over the last few weeks, the House has passed six of the twelve appropriations bills and we are on pace to pass the other six out before the end of September. The Senate is also moving appropriations bills, which means that for the first time in almost two decades, Congress is set to pass all twelve appropriations bills on time. In addition, the House and Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act for 2019 to restore military readiness and increase the capability of our armed forces. The measure gives our troops a 2.6% pay raise, increases funding for training in each branch of service, and authorizes additional funding for maintenance of our military equipment and facilities. It also authorizes two additional Littoral Combat Ships that will be built in Mobile. The House and Senate also passed the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, and President Trump signed it into law on July 31. This bill reauthorizes federal funding for more ! career and technical education through 2023, which should help meet the growing need for technical and craft workers. 
  WHAT YOU'VE BEEN ASKING ABOUT 
  Each week, my office receives hundreds of phone calls, emails, and letters from you about various topics. Two of the subjects that people in the 6th District have recently contacted us about are:   Border Security & Immigration Reform Act (H.R. 6136): Immigration remains a highly discussed issue and H.R. 6136 was one of the major immigration bills recently brought to the floor. The security of the American people is one of my top priorities and border security and interior enforcement are critical for accomplishing that. I supported H.R. 4760, which contained these elements, plus mandated E-Verify, ended chain migration, and eliminated the diversity visa lottery. I opposed H.R. 6136 as it did not sufficiently strengthen any of these measures.   President Trump’s Tariffs: On March 8, 2018, President Trump announced a 10% tariff on aluminum imports and a 25% tariff on steel imports. Since then, he has also implemented tariffs on many Chinese goods in response to what his administration has designated “unfair trade practices” under Section 301 of U.S. trade law. Tariffs that are broad in scope like these ultimately amount to an additional tax on consumers. I understand President Trump’s desire to protect American businesses, but I think the proposed tariffs could undo progress in manufacturing and increase product costs. I understand that some targeted tariffs are needed, but I also believe we can utilize our enormous energy resources to advance our economic interests.
  
IN THE DISTRICT 
  Shipt Expansion: The online grocery marketplace Shipt has announced an expansion in the Birmingham area that will create over 800 new jobs in Birmingham. This is a great example of Shipt’s commitment to Alabama and am excited for the many new opportunities this expansion will create, from professional shopping to engineering to data science. The Alabama Department of Commerce predicts that this expansion will generate $1.1 billion in new payroll over 20 years.   Tax Reform in the 6th District: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has greatly benefited the 6th District. On average, people should see an average tax cut of $1,406 and an income tax decrease of 10.8% for all tax filers in 2018. The projected tax cut for a family of 4 for 2018 is $2,403 and a projected increase in take-home pay over the next 10 years of $39,638.   Upcoming District Work Period: I will be hosting a “Pastries with Palmer” gathering at Jemison City Hall in early August to kick off the district work period. I have multiple other events planned throughout the district as I continue to visit people in all six of the counties in the district.

Dear Neighbor,

This is just a quick reminder that my office is accepting internship applications for the fall semester until Friday, August 10th! 

Working in a Congressional office can be an incredibly rewarding and exciting experience. An internship provides an excellent opportunity to gain valuable experience, and observe first-hand how our government operates. 

Interns in the Washington office draft constituent correspondence, attend briefings and Congressional hearings, and prepare memoranda for me and members of my staff. Interns in the District Office conduct research, assist with constituent casework and draft correspondence. Interns in both offices assist with answering phones, data entry and general office systems operations. Interns are an important part of my staff.

Interns are accepted throughout the year on a part-time basis, and priority is given to college-level students from the 11th District. Selection is based on an applicant's general office and computer experience, interview, and a short writing sample. Please submit a cover letter, resume and a brief writing sample to the office of your choice.

The application deadline for the fall semester is August 10th. Please email your information to:

Dear Friend, 
District Update 
I joined Texas Organizing Project and Rep. Lloyd Doggett to shed light on Medicaid and Medicare cuts. Texas continues to have the highest uninsured rate in the country. Expanding cuts to these programs jeopardizes American lives to provide bigger tax cuts to the wealthy and large corporations.

Holding Administration Accountable for Family Reunification 
The Trump Administration has now missed two deadlines to reunite the migrant children with their loved ones as court-ordered by U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw last month. This is contrary to what the Hispanic Caucus learned in our meeting with Department of Homeland (DHS) Secretary Nielsen where she told us the Administration was on track to meet this deadline. This is a continuing human rights abuse. Indefinite family detention is not the solution, and we must continue to hold the Administration accountable to reunite every last one of these kids with their families.

￼  
Economic Development & Congressional Update 
As we kick off the August district work period, I want to update you on the work I have been doing in Congress on behalf of Central Washington. From providing relief from burdensome federal regulations to taking steps to rein in the national debt and securing our border, the House of Representatives has been passing legislation to improve the lives of Americans.
￼ 
While there is more work to be done, I am very proud of the progress that has been made for Central Washington: 
	•	The House passed H.R. 3144 to protect the dams on the lower Snake and Columbia Rivers and maintain clean, affordable renewable energy while protecting the Pacific Northwest salmon population.
	•	I worked to secure funding for Hanford and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in legislation that passed the House on June 8th. The bill also included my amendment to prevent the privatization of the Bonneville Power Administration.
	•	I supported the National Defense Authorization Act to provide the brave men and women of our military with the tools they need to succeed and protect our freedoms. The bill also includes my amendment to reauthorize the Office of River Protection in Richland, which is a vital part of the clean up at Hanford. 
	•	U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue visited Central Washington to hear directly from farmers and ranchers and learn more about region's hop industry. The House also passed the 2018 Farm Bill, which is only reauthorized every 5 years. 
	•	I have been working with the Department of the Interior to ensure that local residents' voices are heard when it comes to transporting grizzly bears into the North Cascades Ecosystem. Legislation passed by the House included my amendment to prohibit funds for the introduction of grizzlies as the federal agencies listen to sound science and local community input. 
	•	My legislation H.R. 5504, to honor fallen Marine Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman, passed the House unanimously. 
	•	I introduced an amendment that would allow all sectors of agriculture to access the H-2A program. The amendment modernizes the current agriculture guest worker program and provides relief for farmers and ranchers across the country who are experiencing critical labor shortage.

A Local Update 
￼ 
I visited the Columbia Center Rotary in Kennewick, where unemployment is down and wages are rising. I spoke about the opportunity that a growing economy represents for Mid-Columbia families and businesses and how important policies like tax reform are to foster that growth. I have been hard at work focusing on priorities for Central Washington and the Tri-Cities region, such as safeguarding our clean, renewable sources of affordable energy - our dams - and keeping the federal government accountable for Hanford cleanup, as well as supporting the groundbreaking scientific research conducted at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.  
￼  Click here to watch KAPP's coverage. 
Behind the Bar 
￼  
In the Pacific Northwest, we start our mornings with coffee. I became an ""honorary barista"" at a Starbucks location in Yakima and got to work at the drive-through for the ""Behind the Bar"" program. Starbucks is one of many American businesses that passed its savings from tax reform legislation to employees through higher wages and more benefits.  
Burbank Business Expansion 
￼
I visited with the economic development team for the Port of Walla Walla to tour and learn about the expansion of the Burbank Business Park. This expansion, which includes the construction of several gas stations, eateries, and retail spaces, provides much-needed convenience for the residents and industries. Additionally, Northwest Equipment Sales, an Idaho-based company, continues to progress on a Mack and Volvo dealership at the Park. This will bring service, parts, truck and trailer sales, leasing and rental departments, and new jobs to the area. It is exciting to hear about these economic developments, and I look forward to seeing how this expansion will benefit local communities.  
Thank you for reading this e-news update. You can also connect with me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. It is an honor and a privilege to represent you in Congress.

Roseau County
 
Dear Friends,
 
This week, I heard from folks around the district about the local and national issues that have been on their minds. Disaster assessments continue in southwest Minnesota as communities plan to address damage caused by extreme weather in June and July. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Homeland Security and Emergency Management (HSEM) officials have been surveying the affected communities to determine what assistance is necessary to recover. I continue to hear from farmers about their concerns with trade. The trade war has left many producers wondering how the U.S. will compensate for the value that is lost from retaliatory tariffs. Farmers will benefit from a timely passage of the 2018 Farm Bill that will reauthorize programs that protect farmers from taking any more unexpected hits. I look forward to working with legislators in the Farm Bill Conference Committee to work out differences and pass this important legislation.
 
Sincerely,
￼ Congressman Collin C. Peterson
Minnesota 7th District
 
Medicare Cost Plan Transition
During the past month, several of you contacted my office to express concern about changes to your Medicare coverage in 2019. As you may know, Medicare Cost Plans are scheduled to sunset in 2019 in a multi-year transition towards a Medicare Advantage market. With nearly 370,000 Cost Plan beneficiaries, Minnesota will be disproportionately impacted by the shift. 
 
Cost Plans will sunset as a result of the Medicare Modernization Act, which was signed into law in 2003. In addition to authorizing Medicare Part D, the legislation established what is commonly referred to as the “2-plan test” which causes Cost Plans to sunset in counties where at least two insurers offer Medicare Advantage plans. The intent of this provision was designed to move Medicare toward a payment model that pays a healthcare provider a fixed rate in a fixed period of time for each enrollee assigned to them, regardless of whether the enrollee seeks care. This type arrangement is broadly supported by insurers and providers across the country. 
 
I recently introduced the Protect Medicare for Seniors Act of 2018 with Congressman Walz to allow Cost Plan beneficiaries to remain on their plans for another two years. This legislation will give Minnesotans who currently enjoy the benefits and flexibility of Cost Plans more time to select comparable plans which match their healthcare needs. If you are unsure whether you have a Cost Plan or whether your county will be affected, contact your health insurance provider to find out. The Minnesota Board on Aging has also released an informational video to explain which steps you can take to ensure that you have coverage in 2019. 
 
I will continue to monitor the transition closely and work to ensure that trusted, high-quality Medicare options remain available throughout greater Minnesota. 
￼
*Cost plans may sunset in blue counties in 2019. 
 
Disaster Assessment Meetings
￼
 
I am continuing to monitor the Preliminary Disaster Assessment of flood damage in the district. Homeland Security and Emergency Management (HSEM) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) held meetings throughout southwestern Minnesota to gather information about the damage, and to explain the Assessment to those affected by the storms that occurred between June 15th and July 11th. The storms caused millions of dollars in damage across many parts of the state. It is important that the disaster assessments are completed quickly so that affected communities receive the assistance they need to repair.
 
60 Years of Agricultural Research
￼
 
My staff joined researchers from the North Central Soil Conservation Research Laboratory in Morris as they celebrated their organization’s 60th anniversary. Members of the research team showcased the projects and partnerships that are promoting innovation in agriculture. The lab is supported by the Barnes-Aastad Soil and Water Conservation Research Association and is an asset to the district. The studies they conduct provide research that benefits a wide variety of individuals and organizations.

On Tuesday, my staff aide Jacki Anderson met with visiting Great Lakes Regional SBA Director Robert Scott and Minnesota SBA leadership. They discussed lending needs in Minnesota, opportunities to increase SBA lending in rural areas, and new ideas that could provide additional resources and support for entrepreneurs. Opportunities to share about our district and discuss new ideas with agency leaders provide an important connection to agencies like SBA who are continuously evolving to meet business lending needs. 
 
Congressional Roundtable Discussion
￼
 
Meg Louwagie of my staff attended the Congressional Roundtable on the impact of changes to the U.S. Refugee Admissions program. The admission ceiling for refugees was changed from 110,000 in 2017 to 45,000 in 2018. This change, combined with the Administration’s travel bans on certain countries, reduced the number of refugees entering Minnesota to a historically low number from 1,660 in 2017 to 611 in 2018. These updates provide important information about the effect Federal policy changes are having on our state.  
Lower Sioux Head Start
￼

On Monday, my staff aide attended the grand opening of the Lower Sioux Early Head Start & Head Start Program. The school is the first Dakota language school in the state of Minnesota and the only Early Head Start start-up in the U.S. this year. The thoughtful work of the school’s Director Vanessa Goodthunder can be seen all over including in a new book written in the Dakota language for students. With only five first-language Dakota speakers they will help raise the next generation of Dakota language speakers.
 
Farmers Union Meetings in the 7th
￼
 
The Minnesota Farmer’s Union hosted several meetings in the seventh district this week. Farmer's Union Vice President, Bryan Klabunde gave a profile of the different industries that are part of the Farmers Union Organization. Thom Petersen, the Government Relations Director updated folks on what happened during the last Minnesota Legislative Session. These meetings in Polk, Norman, Mahnomen, Roseau and Marshall Counties keep our farm families updated on the issues that are important to their communities. 
 
Forever GI Bill Expands VA Educational Benefits
￼
 
Effective August 1, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs implemented 15 more provisions of the Harry W. Colmery Educational Assistance Act of 2017, also known as the Forever GI Bill.
 
These provisions will have an immediate and positive impact on Veterans and their families using VA benefits to pursue their educational goals. Some of the provisions that began August 1 include:
 
	•	Recipients of a Purple Heart awarded on or after Sept. 11, 2001, are now eligible for full Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits for up to 36 months, if not already entitled.
	•	Military and Veteran families who have lost a family member can now reallocate transferred Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.
	•	Additional Guard and Reserve service now counts toward Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility.
	•	Post-9/11 GI Bill students may now receive monthly housing allowance for any days they are not on active duty, rather than having to wait until the next month; and 
	•	Expansion of the Yellow Ribbon Program, which makes additional funds available for GI Bill students, now covers more students. 
 
More provisions are scheduled related to science, technology, engineering and math benefit extensions; increased benefit levels; a pilot program for high-technology training geared toward “upskilling” Veterans to enter the workforce quickly; and another expansion of the Yellow Ribbon Program, which will be implemented by Aug. 1, 2022.

This Week in American History

Amos Owen in 1978
 On August 4, 1916, Amos Owen was born on Sisseton Reservation in South Dakota. He moved to the Prairie Island Indian Reservation at age sixteen and would later become a prominent spiritual leader, tribal chairman, and pipe carrier of the Dakota, working to broker understandings between Native and non-Native peoples. He died June 4, 1990.
 
What’s the Story?
￼
 
Wild rice is the official state grain of Minnesota. Wild rice typically grows in shallow water from 6 inches to 3 feet deep, making Minnesota’s lakes and streams an ideal place to grow. For many years, nearly all the wild rice produced in the world came from Minnesota. While wild rice can be planted as a farm crop, a significant portion of Minnesota’s wild rice grows naturally. Much of Minnesota’s wild rice is still harvested in the traditional Anishinaabe way, by hand from canoes. Wild rice is one of only two cereal grains that are native to North America, and it has provided a plentiful source of protein for humans and wildlife for years. The ornate tin of Gibbs Wild Rice pictured above is displayed in my Washington, D.C. office.

Home in the Seventh District
 


Dear Neighbor,
With the U.S. House in recess, I’m writing this to you right from the Seventh District.  It’s been a busy and productive week. Here’s just a snapshot of the week’s events. 

￼
This week, I met with neighbors at the Buffalo Bayou Watershed and Barker Reservoir Watershed Community Meetings to discuss ways we can make our area more resilient to future storms. Earlier this year, I was proud to spearhead the record $141 billion in disaster relief through the House, including nearly $5 billion for flood prevention that is coming to Texas.  As I promised, there is enough money in this hurricane relief package to finish every federally authorized flood-control project in Harris County at full federal expense.
￼
I also had the pleasure of meeting with the local District 7 delegation of the Korean American Grassroots Conference. We discussed their policy priorities for the 115th Congress, including immigration, small business, U.S.-Korea relations, and civil and human rights. 
￼
As part of my commitment to support and improve the health of Houstonians and Americans across the country, I met with local representatives and leaders from the highly regarded institutions of the Texas Medical Center. We discussed Medicaid, drug pricing, and ways to better support rehabilitation hospitals.  
I am dedicated to medical and scientific research and, recently, I voted to fund the National Institutes of Health $4.1 billion above the President’s budget request. I also increased funding for the National Cancer Institute by $509 million above the President’s request. Additionally, I fought for $100 million more than last year to make sure the vital services of Community Health Centers are available to more Americans. I look forward to my continued work with these leaders and healthcare systems to ensure that Houstonians have access to cutting-edge treatments and the best healthcare in the country.
 To let me know your thoughts on these issues or others that are important to you, you can email me here.
It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. House of Representatives.
 Sincerely,   ￼  John Culberson

 Preparing North Country Students for 21st Century Jobs 
￼ 
The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act was signed into law by President Trump this week. I was pleased to help write this important legislation with the input I received from employers and students across the district, including at our local BOCES programs. To compete in a 21st century economy, workers need the skills and experience necessary to secure high skilled jobs. This is especially important in the North Country, where we are home to industries ranging from bus to train manufacturers, and from paper mills to aerospace engineering. This bipartisan legislation updates federal career and technical education policies to help more students gain the knowledge and skills they need to compete for the in-demand jobs of tomorrow. Click here to read more about this important legislation. 
Adirondack Chamber of Commerce Legislative Forum 
￼  
I joined Senator Betty Little and Assembly members Dan Stec, Carrie Woerner, and Jake Ashby at a legislative forum hosted by the Adirondack Chamber of Commerce. I appreciated the opportunity to provide an update on my work in Congress to bolster our infrastructure, strengthen our economy, and accelerate job creation in our region. I’ll keep working in Congress to help make the North Country a great place to live, work, and start businesses. For a recap of the event, click here. 
St. Lawrence Spirits Tour 
￼ 
On Tuesday, I toured the distillery and boutique hotel at St. Lawrence Spirits in Clayton. St. Lawrence Spirits is a family owned and operated distillery specializing in small batch craft spirits made with locally sourced grains and other raw ingredients. They are also the first distillery to use purified St. Lawrence River water in all of their spirits. Thank you to the Garrett family for the facility tour and for a productive discussion of issues facing local businesses.
Save the River 
￼ 
I met with board members from Save the River in Clayton to discuss my work in Congress to protect our pristine North Country environment and combat invasive species. I’m grateful to Save the River for their continued environmental advocacy! Click here to read about bipartisan, bicameral legislation I recently introduced with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand to combat invasive species. 
New York Life 
￼ 
Planning for retirement can be a daunting task for American workers. On Wednesday, I had a productive meeting with NY-21 representatives from New York Life to discuss strategies to help workers better plan for retirement. Thank you for your advocacy and for meeting with me!
Alliance for Retired Americans 
￼ 
I had a productive meeting with the New York State Alliance for Retired Americans in Glens Falls on Wednesday to discuss the importance of protecting Social Security and Medicare for beneficiaries across our district. Thank you meeting with me! 
Need Help with a Federal Agency? 
￼ 
Do you need help with a federal agency? I'm proud that my offices have helped NY-21 constituents recover millions of dollars in VA and Social Security benefits. If you can't get an answer from a federal agency in a timely fashion, or if you feel you have been treated unfairly, our office may be able to help resolve a problem or get you the information you need.

8/3/18 13:31,New Medicare Cards in the Mail,"￼ 
￼
  
Dear Professor  ,
In an effort to crack down on fraud and identity theft, the federal government has started issuing new Medicare cards with a unique, randomly-assigned number instead of your Social Security Number (SSN).  These new cards are being mailed to Rhode Islanders now.  As there have been scams reported around the distribution of these new cards, please note that Medicare will never call you to ask for personal information or money. You can find out what to do if you receive a suspicious phone call like that here. 
The process for mailing cards takes at least a month, so don't worry if you haven't received yours yet.  You can also check the status of your card here or by logging into your mymedicare.gov account.  Continue using your current Medicare card until the new card arrives.  If you moved, but never notified the Social Security Administration, you may need to update your account. 
You may also be interested to know that I recently supported the Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act, a bill that has since become law, which prohibits federal agencies from including SSNs on documents sent by mail, unless it is absolutely necessary.  I am also an original cosponsor of the Medicare and Medicaid Protection Act, which would safeguard Medicare and Medicaid from efforts to reduce benefits, including those proposals that would increase the Medicare eligibility age or convert earned benefits into a privatized or voucher-based system.  On behalf of the millions of Americans who rely on Medicare and Medicaid for quality health care, I am committed to working with my colleagues to pass this important legislation.
Please know that I remain dedicated to protecting our seniors from fraud and abuse, as I work to safeguard and strengthen Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
As always, feel free to contact my office if you need assistance with this or any other matter.
Sincerely,
 
Jack Reed
United States Senator

SERVING YOU  |  MEDIA CENTER  |  LEGISLATIVE WORK  |  OUR DISTRICT
 
August 3, 2018
 
 
Dear Friend,   Last week, I shared with you news that the House passed my legislation to give states like Rhode Island a leg up when competing for federal funding that strengthens our manufacturing industry. Today, I am proud to announce that the Senate has also passed my bill, making the president’s desk its next stop.   This bill, which allows our state to request a designation as a “Defense Manufacturing Community,” will give selected communities an edge when competing for financial and technical assistance through the Department of Defense. This designation means real jobs and real results for working Rhode Islanders.   I look forward to working with our private, public, and non-profit sectors to take advantage of this bill's opportunity once signed into law.   3-D GUNS   Gun violence is an epidemic in our country. We should be doing everything possible to make it more difficult for criminals, children, and individuals with serious mental illness to possess a gun. Instead, the Trump administration has decided to allow the online publishing of 3-D blueprints for these weapons. This decision will open the floodgates for anyone with access to the internet and a 3-D printer to possess a firearm.   At the beginning of the week, I introduced legislation prohibiting the manufacture or possession of 3-D guns. These plastic-printed weapons, which also lack serial numbers, are made to be virtually untraceable by law enforcement and undetectable by modern security devices used in airports, schools, and other would-be targets for mass shooters. It is a disaster waiting to happen.   Since 2013, the State Department has blocked the publishing of downloadable guns because of concerns that it would compromise national security and violate International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Earlier this month, however, the State Department suddenly reversed course allowing the publishing of this technology as early as August 1 -- without rationale behind their decision-making process.   On Tuesday night, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to halt the release of these blueprints, which was a step in the right direction. Now it is up to Congress to permanently prevent the distribution of this technology by moving forward with my bill.   It is vital that my colleagues come together in support of keeping this form of weaponry out of the hands of those who are a danger to others and themselves.   SUPPORTING RHODE ISLAND’S FIRST RESPONDERS   All of us owe our firefighters a debt of gratitude for keeping Rhode Islanders safe, and that means protecting the resources that allow them to do their jobs safely and effectively.   On Monday, I was delighted to join Public Safety Commissioner Steven Pare, Mayor Jorge Elorza, Senator Reed and Congressman Langevin in unveiling the Providence Fire Department’s new Rescue 1 vehicle.   This state-of-the-art vehicle is exactly how government should work for the people it serves. I’m proud to have advocated directly to FEMA to help secure nearly $1 million in federal resources that enabled the acquisition of this top-of-the-line rescue vehicle, and other tools that will help ensure our brave first responders can do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible.   The Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program is a great investment, and I’m glad to have helped increase federal support by $5 million in the recent government spending bill, boosting the total investment to $350 million annually, as well as, boosting federal support for the SAFER grant program, which helps Fire Departments hire and train new firefighters, by $5 million.   These increases are a good start, but we could still be doing more to make sure our Departments have the resources they need. None of us should be able to rest until all Rhode Islanders are able to have complete confidence that our fire departments have access to the finest vehicles, resources and trainings. That’s why I’m going to continue working, alongside my colleagues in the Delegation to support robust funding for FEMA’s AFG program, and to continue bringing these resources back to Rhode Island.   As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns, please call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov.   You can also click here to follow my work on Twitter.    Warm Regards, ￼  David Cicilline Member of Congress

8/3/18 13:04,"A Booming Economy, Safer Communities, and A Stronger Military - Better Off Now","￼ 
PROUD TO SERVE MISSISSIPPI’S THIRD DISTRICT 
Dear Friend,

Two years ago, House Republicans presented a bold, new policy agenda called A Better Way aimed at addressing some of the largest challenges facing Americans. 

I'm happy to report that Republicans are delivering on our promises. As a result, America is stronger at home and abroad, our economy is booming, we enjoy safer communities, and our military is in a new era of strength and resiliency. 

The House passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, giving the American tax payer the relief you deserve. Since this historic legislation was signed into law, our nation's unemployment is at an historic low, job numbers are at record highs, paychecks are growing, and wages are rising with economic optimism. 

We have also made significant investments to combat the opioid crisis, an effort that I have been honored to lead as Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Additionally, we have taken significant strides to end human trafficking, target dangerous criminals, and make our schools safer. 

The Trump Administration has prioritized the military, and we are working together to strengthen and rebuild – something that has been neglected for far too long. Furthermore, we fully funded the largest pay raise for our troops in 9 years, and reformed the VA to provide better care to our nation's veterans. 

In short, Americans are seeing jobs, opportunity, and confidence come back with a renewed sense of faith in our future. For more information, check out the better off now website here. 


God Bless,

￼

8/3/18 13:04,Blaine’s Bulletin: Keeping Our Promise to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses,"￼ 
August 3, 2018

BLAINE'S BULLETIN

America is a nation built on the promise of opportunity, particularly the promise that all citizens have an equal opportunity to attain success and prosperity. This is the reason Congress passed the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act in 1999. It established a government-wide contracting goal for businesses owned by service-disabled veterans. But as the saying goes, nothing is perfect.
Although the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act intended to increase the available opportunities for service-disabled veteran businesses, in practice there has been a disparity between state and federal contracting goals. Under the current Highway Bill, federal funds are distributed to the states to fund our nation’s roads and bridges, but unfortunately some states do not have the same contracting goals as the federal government. This means that many service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses are at a competitive disadvantage and do not receive the contracting preference they were promised. 
To correct this inequity, I recently introduced the Service Disabled Veteran Infrastructure Investment Parity Act. My bill amends the Highway Bill to add service-disable veteran-owned small businesses to an already existing contracting goal which currently includes women and socially or economically disadvantaged small businesses. By including service-disabled veterans in this classification we are ensuring that no matter the industry, those who served our nation will have a fair opportunity to compete for transportation contracts. 
We can never fully thank or repay our veterans and their families for their service and sacrifice. However, as neighbors, friends, relatives, and as Americans we can work hard every day to show our veterans just how grateful we are. As a member of Congress, it is my duty to fight for our veterans with just as much passion and conviction as they utilized when fighting for us. I’m hopeful that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in supporting the Service Disabled Veteran Infrastructure Investment Parity Act. By advancing this legislation, we will be fulfilling the promise we made by ensuring service-disabled veteran small businesses receive the opportunities they deserve.

Job Fair in Fort Wayne
￼ 
On Wednesday, August 8 from 12-3 p.m., I am hosting a job fair in conjunction with Purdue University Fort Wayne and WorkOne Northeast in Fort Wayne.
The job fair will feature regional postsecondary education institutions and local employers looking to hire new employees. Representatives from 70 employers and employment agencies will attend, with more than 2,500 jobs available to job seekers. It also will feature resume assistance and interview coaching.
Location: Purdue University Fort Wayne Walb Student Union, Union Circle Drive, Fort Wayne 
Job seekers will be able to meet with employers with openings and obtain resume and job interview assistance from WorkOne Northeast, which is overseen by Northeast Indiana Works. Individuals will have the opportunity to learn how to create an attention-getting resume, develop conversations to highlight their experience and qualifications and follow up after job interviews.
Space is limited and you must register to attend. You can sign up here. I hope to see you there! 
Fort Wayne Optimal Location For F-16s
On Monday, I joined Senator Todd Young in sending a letter to Heather Wilson, Secretary of the Air Force, in support of transitioning Fort Wayne Air National Guard Base’s 122nd Fighter Wing from A-10s to F-16 fighter jets. 
The 122nd Fighter Wing at Fort Wayne represents an optimal unit to transition to F-16s. The Indiana Air National Guard possesses deep experience with F-16s that would minimize or eliminate challenges normally associated with a unit transitioning between aircraft. In fact, the 122nd Fighter Wing flew F-16s for 18 years. As a result, the unit includes a large number of pilots and maintenance personnel who possess extensive knowledge regarding the F-16.  
F-16s at Fort Wayne would once again enjoy quick access to nearby airspace and air to ground ranges to maintain readiness. Fort Wayne boasts an absence of noise encroachment issues, and the Fort Wayne community would eagerly welcome the return of F-16s. 
Click here to read our full letter to the Secretary of the Air Force.

President Trump Issues Major Disaster Declaration for Three Counties in Michigan

Houghton - President Donald J. Trump issued a ""Major Disaster Declaration"" for Michigan, following the devastating flooding that occurred on Father's Day. Congressman Bergman released the following statement:

""I applaud President Trump and the Administration for approving Lt. Governor Calley's request to declare the damage in Houghton, Gogebic, and Menominee counties a major disaster. I will continue to encourage the Administration to approve Individual Assistance, as that portion remains in the review process. The flooding on Father's Day could not dampen the Yooper spirit, and today's news is another great step towards rebuilding and getting copper country back on it's feet,"" said Bergman. 

After he visited Houghton the day after the flooding, Congressman Bergman wrote a letter to Governor Snyder, along with both U.S. Senators, letting his office know federal officials stood ready to support the State of Michigan's recovery efforts. That letter can be found  HERE.

On July 9th, Lt. Governor Calley sent a letter to President Trump requesting a major disaster declaration for Houghton, Gogebic, and Menominee counties. 

Congressman Bergman, Senators Stabenow, and Peters sent a letter of support to President Trump, urging a disaster declaration for the three counties affected. That letter in its entirety can be found HERE.

Governor Murphy's School Funding Cuts
  
Dear  ,  
I have heard from many constituents who are concerned with Governor Murphy’s school funding cuts, which will have a negative impact on our community – particularly in the Toms River, Brick, and Lenape Regional School Districts. I am as upset about this as you are.  
Two of my grandparents were teachers who became school superintendents, my mother was a librarian, and I studied to be a teacher. I have a deep respect for our public school system and the educators and support staff who do so much to improve the lives of our children. Governor Murphy’s funding cuts will put our schools in a difficult position and will inevitably lead to higher taxes, less extracurricular opportunities, and cuts in staff. Our students, educators, and support staff deserve better than this. 
Unfortunately, as a federal legislator, I have no recourse to change Governor Murphy’s decision to cut our school funding. Unlike Governor Murphy and legislators in Trenton, I have been committed to maintaining federal funding for education. 
Earlier this year, I supported the bipartisan federal funding package that included an additional $2.6 billion to support the Department of Education, $86 million more to impact aid programs to assist school districts meet the needs of military families like those who serve at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, and a $700 million increase to grant programs to expand school-based mental health services and bullying prevention. We also passed a bipartisan law to help make our schools safer, by offering grants for security improvements. 
I also recently opposed an effort to cut funding to the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities. These programs give our students a valuable opportunity to enrich their education and I was proud to stand up to leaders in my own party who wanted to make these cuts. 
There is absolutely no justification for Governor Murphy’s decision to cut school funding in some of our district’s largest towns and I will stand with leaders in our community to fight these cuts every step of the way.  
If I can ever be of any assistance, please contact me by visiting my website: http://macarthur.house.gov. 
 
Thank you, 
￼ 
Congressman Tom MacArthur

Dear Oklahoma Friends and Neighbors,  
July was another very busy month in the Senate and August will be just as busy. Typically, the Senate is not in session in August, but several of us encouraged Senate Leadership to keep us in session so we could work on passing the budget and presidential nominations. I’d much rather spend time traveling Oklahoma to visit with you face-to-face, but the work is not done yet in Washington, DC.
Thankfully, we have made progress by passing seven of the twelve funding bills that must be completed by September 30, including the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee bill, which I authored as Subcommittee Chairman. However, more work remains and the Senate will continue this important work over the next few weeks. If you need to get in touch with me, please contact my office or visit my website, www.lankford.senate.gov. I update the website regularly to help keep you informed. 
Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh  At the end of June, Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement from the bench after 43 years of service. In the following days, President Trump announced Judge Brett Kavanaugh as his pick to serve as Justice Kennedy’s replacement. Two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to sit down with Judge Kavanaugh in my office to walk through his experience serving as a US Circuit Judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Our conversation focused on the separation of powers and the role of each branch of government, First and Fourth Amendment judicial precedent, and constitutional interpretation. It was a pleasure to meet with him one-on-one, and I look forward to his confirmation hearings in early September and a vote on the Senate floor in the days ahead.
If you would like to read more about Judge Kavanaugh, visit the ""Current Issues"" page on my website to access his 600-page biographical background, which includes links to additional pages of speeches, court opinions, and articles. Judge Kavanaugh has already turned over more than a million pages of background information, which is more than any other judicial candidate. CLICK HERE to access the ""Current Issues"" page. 
To read my statement on Justice Kennedy’s retirement, CLICK HERE. To read my statement on meeting with Judge Kavanaugh, CLICK HERE. 
Meeting with the President on Trade 
Last week, I sat down with President Trump and his staff to discuss the ongoing trade negotiations.  Prior to our meeting, President Trump and the Commission President of the European Union announced they have agreed to work toward zero tariffs, buy more American natural gas, purchase America soybeans, and to wrap up trade disputes on cars, steel, and aluminum quickly. This is a significant step forward in our trade negotiations with Europe. During my meeting with President Trump, he laid out their plan to conclude all ongoing trade negotiations as soon as possible with Mexico, Canada, South Korea, and China.
I’ve continued to share with my colleagues and the Administration the direct impact the tariffs have made on Oklahoma families. For example, steel tariffs negatively impact manufacturing; the softwood tariffs are increasing the cost of new homes; the price of commodities has dropped over the past several months as farmers have lost markets or faced foreign tariffs. Newspapers are feeling the pressure since the cost of papers has increased dramatically. The list goes on. The United States is 25 percent of the world's economy, which means we can, and should, be able to see to the other 75 percent of the world. 
Free trade is good for our nation, good for our families, and good for our economy. I’m committed to ensuring that the Administration sees the negotiations through to bring stability back to the marketplace. CLICK HERE to read my statement following my meeting with President Trump and his staff. 
Last Thursday, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer testified in front of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies. I asked him about the Administration’s goals to resolve trade negotiations and their plans to open new markets. CLICK HERE to watch my Q&A with him. The day before the Appropriations Subcommittee hearing, I spent a long time with Ambassador Lighthizer to talk one-on-one through trade policy and the direction of the global negotiations. 
Secure Elections Act 
The Secure Election Act is a bipartisan bill I introduced with my colleague Amy Klobuchar from Minnesota to strengthen election cybersecurity in America for the next election and future elections. The bill currently has 12 bipartisan cosponsors, including the Chair and Vice Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. We should learn from the 2016 election and make the changes that are necessary to protect state's voting systems from hostile nations like Russia.
Earlier this month, the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration held two hearing on my bill. I testified in front of the Committee to urge them to pass this bill so states can streamline cybersecurity information-sharing with federal intelligence entities and to ensure support for state election cybersecurity infrastructure. On Wednesday, the Senate Rules Committee announced they will make technical changes to the bill during a committee hearing on August 15. This is one step closer to the bill being considered on the Senate floor. 
CLICK HERE to watch my testimony in front of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.
I also spoke on the Senate floor to lay out the story of how Oklahoma’s voting system was targeted by the Russians. CLICK HERE to watch the speech. 
Russia continues to interfere in many countries' elections to create instability and doubt in government. We must work to ensure our elections and nation is secure from future attempts of hacking. CLICK HERE to watch my interview with ABC’s This Week last Sunday. 
The Breakdown with James Lankford 
I recently started a podcast entitled, The Breakdown with James Lankford. This is an opportunity to break down the difficult issues that in the news and dig deeper into all the moving parts of an issue. The first episode covered immigration and the separation of families. This week, I released the second episode which covers trade and tariffs.

Religious Freedom Summit 
Two weeks ago, the State Department held a Ministerial to Advance International Religious Freedom. Senator Coons and I hosted a bipartisan event on Capitol Hill in conjunction with the summit. Earlier this week, I also had the honor to participate in the US Department of Justice Religious Liberty Summit in front of religious leaders of many faiths, legal scholars, and Administration staff. CLICK HERE to view my remarks at the summit.  
Keeping You in the Loop 
	•	 Some good news to report, after two years of unjust imprisonment by the Turkish government, American pastor Dr.  Andrew Brunson has been released from prison on house arrest. This is a step in the right direction, and my colleagues and I, along with the President and Vice President, continue to push Turkey to bring Dr. Brunson home to the United States. CLICK HERE to read my statement after Dr. Brunson was released. CLICK HERE to read about my meeting with Dr. Brunson’s daughter last week.
	•	Earlier this month, I introduced Tulsa attorney, John O’Connor at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee to serve as District Judge for the US District Court for the Eastern, Northern, and Western Districts of Oklahoma. He is a very respected attorney in our state, and I know he will continue to serve Oklahoma and the nation well in this role. To watch the full introduction, CLICK HERE.
	•	Although it is not the current headline in the news, my colleagues and I continue to work to resolve the immigration issues in our country. Two weeks ago, my colleagues and I sent a bipartisan letter to President Trump to urge the Administration to work with the faith community on efforts to reunify families that have been separated at the border. It is important we continue to stress that the default position of the United States should be to keep families together at the border. CLICK HERE to read the letter. But, uniting families does not negate the bigger problem we have with illegal immigration. Each year, over a million people from all over the world legally become citizens of the United States. Each day, over 500,000 people legally cross the southern border for business and tourism. We have hundreds of thousands of people who follow our immigration laws each day; we should not ignore them and their effort to do what is right.
	•	Last Monday, the Senate confirmed the new Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Robert L. Wilkie. I supported Secretary Wilkie’s nomination because there are important issues facing our veterans, especially with health care and VA medical facilities. I look forward to working with Secretary Wilkie to resolve these issues. Our veterans have served our nation; they deserve to have a VA that provides the same level of service and commitment. CLICK HERE to read my full statement.
	•	On Friday, the quarterly GDP economic report was released. It showed that our economy is thriving and that the tax and regulatory reform passed last year is working. Here are the facts: America’s economy continues to grow, unemployment is the lowest it’s been in 18 years, more than 1.2 million jobs have been created this year, businesses are investing and expanding, and 4.1 percent GDP is the largest single-quarter growth the nation has seen in several years. Our economy is finally growing and expanding as a traditional American economy grows and expands.
	•	2018 has been full of achievements and work, but there is more to be done. We continue to work on the issues that are important to Oklahoma like trade, immigration, and support for our growing economy. Here is a short video highlighting the first six months of 2018. CLICK HERE to watch.
	•	The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) passed the House and Senate this week. The President will sign the bill into law in the days ahead. The NDAA is incredibly important for Oklahoma and our nation. This is the main policy document for our military for the next year and it dictates the support and plan for the country's national defense.

ABOUT NITA           CONSTITUENT SERVICES           NEWSROOM           LEGISLATIVE ISSUES           17th DISTRICT           CONTACT ME 
Dear Friend:
White Plains lost one of its heroes.  
I was deeply saddened to learn about the passing of Lt. Clark Douglass, a 30-year veteran of the city's fire department who passed away from cancer believed to be related to his work at Ground Zero following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  
Even though Lt. Douglass didn't have to be there, he was among the first who worked on the frontlines at Ground Zero following that unimaginable day. Lt. Kevin Heffernan said that Lt. Douglass ""worked tirelessly"" after the attacks and ""didn't want to take a break,"" because ""there were more people to rescue."" Lt. Douglass, who came from a family of four generations of White Plains firefighters, was a true hero, and we will always remember his sacrifice.  
Like all New Yorkers, I believe that the survivors and the first responders who risked or ultimately gave their lives to save others in the 9/11 rescue and recovery efforts deserve our support.   
As the highest ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, this year I successfully fought against a proposal by the Administration to alter the existing structure of the World Trade Center Health Program, which, in my view, would have jeopardized the level of care provided to the more than 83,000 9/11 first responders who have received monitoring and treatment from the program.  
We will never be able to fully repay 9/11 first responders, but we can ensure that they and their families get the benefits and care they deserve.  
It is an honor to represent the Lower Hudson Valley in the United States Congress.

Smith Defends the Environment in the National Defense Authorization Act & Moves Mountains to Sound One Step Closer to Recognition 
This summer, we achieved hard-fought victories to protect our environment and fight climate change. As Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Committee, I continue to advocate for policies that preserve our planet and require plans for energy and conservation focused polices across all levels of government. 
Defeating Harmful Anti-Environment Policy Riders 
With the passage of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Conference Report in the Senate this week, I want to thank you for your tireless support of policies to protect our environment and fight climate change. 
As in previous years, we faced an uphill battle on numerous harmful anti-environmental riders. Republican efforts to include these riders were emboldened by the fact that Republicans control the House, Senate, and White House. 
While the conference report is not perfect, I am pleased that this year’s NDAA does not include almost any of the harmful anti-environmental riders that were proposed. In addition, I am proud that we used this year’s NDAA to highlight the growing threat that climate change has on our national security, country, and the world.  
I, along with my Democratic colleagues, successfully prevented the inclusion of numerous environmental riders in the conference report, as we have done for several years, including: 
	•	Endangered Species Act: Does not include a provision that would have seriously undermined Endangered Species Act protections for the Greater Sage Grouse, the Lesser Prairie Chicken, and the American Burying Beetle.
	•	Mineral Mining Regulations: Does not include a provision that would have weakened the environmental review and regulatory process for new mines.
	•	Indefinite Land Withdrawals: Does not include the House provision that would have made all military land withdrawals indefinite.
I was also successful in adding new provisions to NDAA related to climate change and energy. These include provisions requiring DOD installations to establish energy and climate resiliency plans, authorizing the use of certain funds to help local communities deal with sea level rise, and requiring plans for an operations energy policy that enhances energy security, resiliency, and conservation. 
I will continue to work each year to ensure that the NDAA is focused on supporting our military service members and enhancing national security, not driving partisan riders that are harmful to our environment. Congress must do more to protect our environment and enact policies to promote clean energy and address climate change, and I look forward to continuing to work with you on those efforts.    
Again, I want to thank the environmental community for your strong advocacy to keep anti-environmental riders out of this legislation. Your support has without a doubt helped achieve a successful outcome in this year’s NDAA.  
Funding for Highline School District for Noise Mitigation in Classrooms 
As the Ranking Member, I fought to include a provision in the NDAA to provide Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) funding for noise mitigation projects at schools in the Highline School District in Burien, WA. Sea-Tac Airport is located in the center of Highline School District and many of the district’s schools are impacted by airport noise. A 2002 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Port of Seattle, the FAA, and Highline School District outlined noise mitigation for a number of Highline School District schools. Since the MOA was signed, the Port and the Highline School District met their portion of the funding obligation. During that time, the noise contours around the airport changed, leaving the two schools in areas where they did not qualify for the previously agreed upon funding. 
In May, I offered an amendment to the NDAA – pushed by Sen. Cantwell in the Senate – to fix the issue by allowing the FAA to provide noise mitigation funding to schools like Highline that no longer qualified for the committed funding.  The amendment will give the district access to more than $14 million in FAA Airport Improvement Grants for noise mitigation projects including replacement of doors, windows, and the installation of through-the-wall AC units, or for new construction to include noise mitigation. 
This is a great example of how all levels of government can come together to solve a problem. Highline School District has been working tirelessly to meet the terms of the agreement with the FAA to help mitigate noise pollution that the schools experience. The provision in the NDAA was crafted with bipartisan, bicameral support and will help ensure that promises made to our local schools are kept. I thank Senator Cantwell and the Port of Seattle for their advocacy on this critical issue. Having grown up in SeaTac myself, I know it is important to fight for our children’s right to a safe and healthy learning environment.

House Passage of the Mountains to Sound Greenway National Heritage Act
Earlier this summer, the House of Representatives unanimously passed the Mountains to Sound Greenway National Heritage Act (H.R. 1791). The passage of the Mountains to Sound Greenway National Heritage Act, the first such designation in the Pacific Northwest, reflects the sustainable relationship between Washington state residents and nature in the Puget Sound Region. 
The Mountains to Sound Greenway will help preserve and promote the area’s scenery, resources and history for future generations. I thank Congressman Reichert for his stalwart leadership, the Mountains to Sound Greenway Trust for their tireless advocacy, and the engaged community members that made it possible for us to join together in preserving this natural treasure. Click below to watch my floor speech in support of this critical designation.

Griffith Seeks Answers from Drug Manufacturers Regarding Opioid Crisis
Friday, August 3, 2018 – Congressman Morgan Griffith (R-VA) and bipartisan leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent letters to three leading drug manufacturers seeking answers and documents regarding their roles in the opioid crisis. Griffith issued the following statement:
“The Energy and Commerce Committee has been examining the many aspects of the opioid crisis in our communities. Particularly, the Committee has been investigating the role of companies that supply drugs as part of our commitment to address this crisis. Our letter to three drug manufacturers continues this work. We are seeking answers in an effort to understand how drug manufacturer practices may have affected the course of the opioid crisis.”
In addition to Griffith, Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-OR), Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone (D-NJ), Committee Ranking Vice Chairman Kathy Castor (D-FL), Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Chairman Gregg Harper (R-MS), and Subcommittee Ranking Member Diana DeGette (D-CO) signed the letters. Griffith is Vice Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.
The letter to Purdue Pharma inquires about when the company knew of the dangers of OxyContin. According to a plea entered in U.S. District Court in Abingdon, three executives of the company pled guilty in 2007 of mislabeling OxyContin. The letter signed by Griffith asks whether or not they also instructed sales staff to mislead medical providers.
The letter to Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals seeks answers about the practice of “chargebacks,” in which drug manufacturers provide discounts to drug wholesale distributors in exchange for direct customer sales data.
The letter to Insys Therapeutics asks about alleged kickbacks organized by company officials to increase sales of Subsys. a sublingual fentanyl spray.

8/3/18 9:03,Opportunity is the enemy of poverty,"￼ 
Friday August 3, 2018

Opportunity is the enemy of poverty
This column originally appeared in the Highland County Press and Cincinnati Enquirer.  Back in 1931, historian James Truslow Adams endowed us with our first definition of what we call ""the American dream."" He wrote: ""The American Dream is that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement.""
This is what our country's Founders were after when they structured our government around protecting every American's right to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" The goal was – and is – to create a country in which each citizen is free to carve out their own destiny, and achieve whatever they are capable of in their lives. It’s not about guaranteeing an equal outcome for every citizen, but rather about structuring a society where opportunity is available for all who would seize it. That is the essence of what we still strive for today. 
But what about the parts of our country where ""opportunity for all"" seems more like a lofty ideal than an actual reality? What about our distressed inner cities, rural areas entrenched in poverty, or the devastated communities of Puerto Rico? A 2017 study by the Economic Innovation Group found that ""52.3 million Americans live in economically distressed communities… That represents one in six Americans, or 17 percent of the U.S. population."" A historical lack of investment in these communities hobbles their potential to grow and prosper.
We simply cannot afford to leave that many Americans on the sidelines of prosperity. Not only are they missing out on what our country has to offer, our country is missing out on what they can contribute. That is where the idea of ""Opportunity Zones"" comes in. Included as a bipartisan provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that became law on Dec. 22, 2017, there now is a specific incentive for investors to make long-term investments in designated Opportunity Zones: communities across America that remain mired in economic hardship.
It works like this: the legislation empowers governors to identify localities within their state lines that meet the definition of distressed communities, or areas in desperate need of economic opportunity. To qualify, the area must be ""a census tract with a poverty rate of at least 20 percent and a median family income of less than 80 percent of the statewide median family income."" These low-income communities are then designated as ""Opportunity Zones,"" which provide federal tax benefits to investors who choose to invest there. Additional incentive is provided if an investor chooses to invest for at least 10 years. 
This new capital goes into an Opportunity Fund, which supports development projects like job training, and investing in small businesses or start-ups. The goal is to spur job creation and economic development in communities that have been too long neglected, by harnessing private investment and the power of the free market. As the New York Times reported: ""The provision is the first new substantial federal attempt to aid those communities in more than a decade. …If the zones succeed, they could help revitalize neighborhoods and towns that are starved for investment.""
So far, Opportunity Zones have been approved in 46 states, including here in Ohio. In fact, 45 Opportunity Zones have already been designated in Ohio's 2nd Congressional District alone. Can you imagine the difference that private investment could make in so many historically overlooked communities? It's no wonder that governors across the country from both political parties have spoken out about what this could mean for their state’s lowest income communities.
An important aspect of Opportunity Zones is that they were designed to be fluid, so that once an Opportunity Zone is lifted out of poverty, it will eventually no longer meet the qualifications to remain on the list of Opportunity Zones. The intention here is to create a continual ebb and flow of dynamic capital, so that investments aren’t static and don't become too concentrated. Instead, once one zone is thriving economically, investors will be encouraged to begin to invest in Opportunity Funds within other underserved communities.
The best part? This isn’t a talking point: it’s the law of the land. It’s the type of bipartisan policy with real-world impact that should excite all Americans – Democrats and Republicans alike – who are passionate about effectively addressing poverty and breathing new life into the American dream. It’s an innovative way to incentivize private investors to allocate their capital so that it provides economic growth for communities in desperate need of it. While there is still much to learn and analyze, it could mark the bold beginning of something big. 
Opportunity is the enemy of poverty. So instead of fighting poverty with more government programs, this approach fights systemic poverty with the intentional and strategic spread of economic opportunities. It brings us back to the idea that Adams was talking about, back to the idea that sparked this great nation: that the best way to progress as a nation is to protect citizen’s rights and empower their ability to improve their own lives. We never want any American to say they were not given the chance to succeed.

8/3/18 8:37,Supporting our kids. ,"August 3, 2018                                
Share on Facebook | Share on Twitter | Permalink 
￼
As a father, the safety and wellbeing of my children will always be my top priority.  As your representative in Congress, I’ll continue to fight for your family and your kids.  From ensuring that they have a roof over their head to making sure they are safe in their schools, several bills that I have sponsored and cosponsored are going to make a difference for kids in Ohio and across the country. 
YOU KNOW YOUR FAMILY BEST
￼
For thousands of American families, Flexible Spending Accounts, or FSAs, are a great way to set aside money for things like copays or prescriptions, and to save for bigger expenses – like braces for your child.  Unfortunately, under current law, funds that are put into FSAs could not be rolled over to the next year.  Worse yet, their unused dollars are forfeited back each year, forcing Americans to “use it or lose it.” 
A bill that I introduced, the RAISE Act, makes Flexible Spending Accounts more flexible by doing two simple things: raising the cap and letting you keep more of your money.  Under the Affordable Care Act, FSAs were capped at $2650, which is barely half of what the average American worker paid towards the cost of their health  coverage last year.  The RAISE Act triples that and allows funds to be rolled over so that families can save for large, unexpected medical procedures.  
The RAISE Act was included in H.R. 6311, a package of health care-related bills that passed the House last month and will make sure that families aren’t punished for doing the right thing: saving. 
SCHOOL MUST BE A SAFE PLACE
￼
As a father, I want to ensure the safety of all of our kids when we send them off to school.  That is why I cosponsored the STOP School Violence Act, which passed the House in March.  Now, grants are available to help train school officials and local law enforcement how to identify and intervene early when signs of violence arise.  In addition, the grants also give them access to FBI and Secret Service-based school threat assessment protocols to prevent school shootings.  
To make sure that schools in the 15th District and Ohio are able to take full advantage of these resources, I sent a letter to the Bureau of Justice Assistance in support of Ohio’s grant application, and will continue to work to ensure that our kids are safe.  You can read the letter here. 
NO CHILD SHOULD BE WITHOUT A HOME
￼
Right now, there are an estimated 1.3 million children in this country without a home. 1.3 million.  Many of these children may not fit the picture of homelessness: they are couch-surfing with friends, or staying in motels, or finding a corner on the floor in a house crowded with relatives to curl up in at night.  But they are homeless, and they are at high risk of dropping out of school, of falling into addiction, of being trapped into human trafficking, and they need our help. 
In order to access the crucial services they need, we have to make sure that these children are counted as homeless by the agencies designed to help them.  My bill, the Homeless Children and Youth Act, amends the definition of “homelessness” used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) so that we can bring these children who have been living in the shadow of darkness into the light. I was proud to see this bill recently pass the House Financial Services Committee. No child should ever be without a home, and entrapping them with bureaucratic red tape adds insult to injury. 
 As always, it is my honor to serve you in Congress.  If you have any questions about the RAISE Act, the STOP School Violence Act, or the Homeless Children and Youth Act, please call my Washington, D.C. office at (202) 225-2015, my Hilliard office at (614) 771-4968, my Lancaster office at (740) 654-2654, or my Wilmington office at (937) 283-7049.

8/2/18 23:14,This algae in our waters,"￼ 
 
Dear Friends, 
This toxic green algae in our water is making people sick. It's killing the fish and wildlife that call these waterways home. And it's hurting our economy and the local businesses that rely on the tourists and visitors who typically visit our state - and who are now looking for somewhere else to go. 
While we are trying to do everything we can to help those who are most affected by these toxic algae blooms - whether it's trying to get local businesses some much needed tax relief to help them make ends meet, or calling on the CDC to help us understand potential health impacts of algae exposure - it's important to realize that there is no quick fix to this problem. There is no magical solution that will make this algae go away overnight. 
This is a problem that's been years in the making - and it's a problem that's going to take years to fix. And anyone who tells you that fixing the dike around Lake Okeechobee will somehow solve this problem is fooling you. 
The federal government is responsible for fixing the dike. And for the past 17 years, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has spent over $1 billion to strengthen the dike to prevent a massive, catastrophic breach that could kill thousands of people living south of Lake Okeechobee - and we have just authorized an additional $600 million to speed up the completion of the dike by 2022. 
The State of Florida, on the other hand, is the one responsible for the quality and cleanliness of the water. For the past eight years our state leaders have repeatedly rolled back environmental standards, eased regulations and dismantled the state's environmental agencies - all of which have allowed more and more pollutants to be dumped into our state's waterways. Our state leaders even passed a law to stop the periodic inspections of leaking septic tanks. 
The bottom line is this: more pollution means more algae. 
As that pollution sits in our waterways and lakes, baking in the hot summer sun, it turns into the green toxic sludge we see today. And when the water from Lake Okeechobee is released into the nearby estuaries and waterways, the toxic algae goes with it. 
It seems like the algae has never been this bad. It's never been this thick. It's never been this toxic. And that's because it's never been this polluted. 
That's why Sen. Rubio and I are continuing to urge Congress to approve a massive reservoir project south of Lake Okeechobee that can be used to help store and clean some of the water being released from the lake before it goes into our waterways. 
Because, at the end of the day, it all comes down to how dirty the water is when it enters our waterways. That's it. The more polluted the water is in our lakes and other waterways, the worse the algae blooms will be. 
So, to truly prevent these algae blooms from reoccurring year after year, we need our state leaders to change course. We need them to start doing the right thing and take the steps needed to keep our waterways clean - instead of the steps they have been taking to allow them to become more polluted. 
As a fifth-generation Floridian who grew up on the Indian River, I know how important these waterways are to our community. They are the lifeblood of our economy and I will continue to do everything I can to protect them. 

Sincerely, ￼

Dear Friend,  Arizonans deserve access to affordable, high-quality health care. Everywhere I go in our state, I hear from businesses, families, seniors, and hardworking people about how expensive health care is and how Washington dysfunction is only making the problem worse. That’s wrong, and it doesn’t need to be this way. That’s why I’m focused on cutting through the chaos to make fixes to our system that help ensure access to quality, affordable care for every Arizonan.  The House passed legislation last week that protects Arizona families from a spike in health care costs from what’s known as the Health Insurance Tax (HIT). A key part of the legislation is based on a bill I introduced with Congresswoman Kristi Noem of South Dakota, to delay the HIT for two more years. This could spare some Arizona families from a projected $500 or more annual increase in health insurance premiums.  The Health Insurance Tax raises costs on Arizona businesses and families, making it more difficult to access quality, affordable health care. We must do everything we can to make health care affordable for everyday Arizonans. Eliminating the HIT is one way we can do just that. We’re pushing past the Washington dysfunction to stop this harmful tax, and we’ll continue working to fix our broken health care system and improve care for all Arizonans.  I am honored to serve in Congress on behalf of Arizona families like yours. We always appreciate hearing from you on current topics and issues that are important to you. If there is an issue that concerns you, please let us know by clicking this link or by calling our Phoenix office: 602-956-2285. Be sure to stay connected through our Facebook and Twitter accounts, and let us know how we can be of service.
Sincerely,
￼

￼ 


  It’s so ridiculous I honestly couldn’t believe it was real.  And I’ve been fighting tooth and nail to stop it ever since.     Without warning or explanation, the Trump State Department gave the green light for a company in Texas to publish downloadable plans for 3-D printed plastic guns - starting August 1st.    That’s right.  Plastic guns you can create at home that load, fire, shoot and kill, but are untraceable, nearly undetectable, and don’t require a background check.  Even the blueprint for an AR-15 – the assault rifle used in the Parkland school massacre – is available online for download by anyone – including terrorists, extremists, criminals and, God forbid, another mass shooter.    It’s insane. We already have a gun violence problem.  Downloadable guns will only supercharge the crisis. 
 So I immediately took action, and introduced a bill with my colleagues to block the publication of these 3D gun blueprints.  

Time was ticking.  But when we tried to pass it, Republicans blocked us. 
   
￼ 
CLICK TO WATCH MY FLOOR SPEECH 
Thankfully a federal court in Seattle issued a temporary injunction shutting down the online depot for 3-D printed firearm blueprints.  But a temporary injunction is just that. Temporary. Already, thousands of people have downloaded these deadly blueprints.   Look, whether it comes from a gun store or out of a 3D printer; if it loads like a gun, shoots like a gun, and kills like a gun -  it’s a gun. And if our gun safety laws don’t keep pace with technology, printed plastic guns will flood our children’s schools, and all hell will break loose. That’s why we have to keep fighting to outlaw these downloadable weapons.    Your role in this is to be loud and outraged – to keep talking about it. Here are 3 small things you can do online to help raise awareness:  
	1.	Share this article about our legislation to #StopDownloadable guns. Share on facebook here, and/or share on Twitter here.   
	2.	Tag one of your friends on Instagram who needs to learn about this issue in this video I posted here. Putting your friend’s handle in the comments will help more people see this video and learn about the issue.  
	3.	TUNE IN to my Facebook Live tomorrow at 11 AM from Cliffside Park Elementary School, where I’ll be highlighting how 3D printed guns put our children and communities at-risk.
By raising awareness and pushing your family and friends to reach out to their members of Congress about it, we can make a difference.     Sincerely,

 July in Photos
School is out for summer, but there has been no shortage of activity in our nation’s capital. This July we have been working to reauthorize the Farm Bill and rebuild our military; while we’ve got a way to go, we’ve also been enacting legislation to ensure our veterans are being better served and cared for.  
Here are five photos that show some of my favorite moments from the month of July:
1. Red Raiders in Washington – There are many Red Raiders serving the good people of West Texas and our country on Capitol Hill this summer! If you are interested or know of any students interested in interning in my Lubbock, Abilene, or Washington office, inquire here. Wreck ‘em! 
￼ 
2. Victories for Vets – With over 400 pieces of legislation introduced by the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, 70 of those bills having passed the House, and nearly 30 having been signed into law by President Trump, Congress is working towards better caring for and serving our veterans. I joined many of my colleagues on the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee to discuss this Congress’ actions on behalf of our veterans. See here for my remarks. 
￼ 
3. West Texans at the Table– I am incredibly honored to serve on the 2018 Farm Bill conference committee. The Farm Bill is not only important for our nation’s economy, but for our national security. I’m confident that with two West Texans, Chairman Conaway and myself, at the table, we will pass a strong Farm Bill.
￼ 
4. Freedom, Fireworks, and Good Food – As I reflect on celebrating our nation’s independence with my family this month, I think of our freedom fighters who commit day in and day out to protect our safety and security. It’s important we continue to support their needs both on and off the battlefield. We are blessed and humbled by their service to our country.
￼ 
5. An American Hero – Chief Petty Officer William “Bill” Mulder was a true American hero and highly decorated combat veteran who, like many of our men and women in uniform, returned after his service to an internal struggle with scars that couldn't be seen. I am proud that the House supported legislation named in his memory that would reform the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) to better assist servicemembers like Bill as they transition to civilian life. Read more about my legislation here.

Dear Friend, 
Threats of a potential trade war spurred by the recently imposed tariffs continue to dominate the headlines and cause concern among many across North Missouri.
￼
Rep. Graves on Fox Business talking trade 
I am not a fan of tariffs but I am a fan of free trade. However, free trade must be fair and that hasn’t necessarily been the case in several of these markets. 
Just look at China, for example. Their theft of technology and intellectual property coupled with the manipulation of their currency is what got this whole thing going. For far too long, we have gotten the raw end of the deal from China and I think we are now starting to get their attention. 
Other countries, such as the European Union, are looking to work out their own deals with the United States, including on important commodities like soybeans. Hopefully, this forces other countries, like China, to the table. 
Last week, I told Neil Cavuto on Fox Business Network that the President is playing the “long game” to get better trade deals. Unfortunately, the “long game” is a much tougher game to play when you’re looking at rising steel prices and lower soybean prices in the short term. 
While many are nervous, and the headlines don’t calm the nerves, many of the folks I talk to in North Missouri want to stick it out. They say they are tired of the U.S. getting the raw deal. I understand that sentiment. 
The bottom line is that farmers want access to markets, not a hand out, and they want those markets to be on a level playing field. It will take negotiation to get that level playing field. It’s my hope that we will see long-term gain from the President’s policies and, as I have been doing from the beginning, I will continue to advise the Administration on what folks in North Missouri think about actions directly affecting their bottom line. 
Sincerely, ￼  Sam Graves

As taxes and red tape go down, economic growth and jobs go up
￼
Discussing the positive impact of the recent tax cuts with local Montanans.
What’s new?
The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis recently reported that our nation’s economy grew by a strong 4.1% between April and June. This terrific news comes alongside robust job creation, very low unemployment, surging small business optimism, and higher consumer spending across our country. Simply put, the U.S. economy is thriving.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, the unexpected surge in our economy is largely the result of the tax cuts that became law last year. I supported this tax relief because it allowed Montana families and small businesses to keep more of their money. I strongly believe you can spend, save, and invest your hard-earned dollars much better than Washington. This tax relief, coupled with reducing job-killing regulations and unleashing our nation’s energy potential, is helping our economy grow.
Why it matters?
Strong economic growth means more jobs and more opportunities for Montanans. A growing economy helps Montana families pay off bills and invest in their children’s future. It also helps small business owners hire more workers, give raises, and invest in the equipment they need to grow. In short, a strong economy can improve living standards for all Montanans.
What’s next?
I will continue to fight to keep taxes low, reduce unnecessary red tape, and support the responsible production of Montana’s diverse energy resources. I’m confident we will see sustained job creation and economic growth if we keep pursuing these smart, successful policies.

Supporting Our Veterans
Dear Friends,
I am writing to update you on my work on behalf of Valley veterans and their families. I am working hard to ensure that our nation’s veterans have access to quality health care and benefits, as well as jobs, education, and affordable housing. I am proud that my voting record has been rated 100% consistent with the policies of both the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and the American Legion.
Fighting For Veterans’ Access to Health Care
Recently, my colleagues and I passed the “VA MISSION Act of 2018.” I am happy to inform you the bill was signed into law. This law would strengthen and reform the delivery of veteran’s health care to ensure timely access for enrolled veterans. By making improvements to and investments in the VA health care system, creating integrated networks so that veterans have access to care when and where they need it, and providing the further recognition and assistance to family caregivers of severely disabled veterans. It also extends funding for the current Veterans Choice Program for one year, provides scholarships to students receiving education or training in a health-care field who agree to work in a VA medical facility, as well as establishes a pilot program to provide scholarships to eligible veterans enrolled at medical schools. Finally it requires the VA to issue recommendations to modernize or realign its medical facilities.
Town Hall Meeting—Tuesday, August 7
I will be holding a Telephone Town Hall Meeting to discuss all of the issues facing Congress.  A Telephone Town Hall operates like a large conference call where you will have a chance to hear my opening remarks and then ask questions on any issue facing Congress. The Telephone Town Hall Meeting will take place Tuesday, August 7 from 7:00pm to 8:30pm PT. To participate in the discussion and listen to what other Valley residents have to say, please call the toll-free number – (877) 229-8493 (Pin #: 13402).  To RSVP or to submit a question in advance of the Town Hall please visit: www.BradSherman.house.gov.
Veterans Education Assistance
The men and women of our armed forces put their lives on the line every day to protect our way of life. Since 1944, the GI Bill has paid veterans back for their service by promising veterans better access to education, job training, and other opportunities that help secure a bright future. We must continue that tradition. When soldiers returns home from serving our country, they deserve the opportunity to build a thriving future for themselves and their families.
That is why I cosponsored the “Forever GI Bill” – which passed the House of Representatives last summer with full bipartisan support, and has since been signed into law. This bipartisan legislative package helps improve veteran access to education and workforce training. It expands GI Bill benefits granted to veterans and their families by establishing a lifetime window for providing college tuition assistance to eligible veterans.
Improving VA Facilities in Los Angeles
I am pleased to report that in the previous Congress both the House and the Senate passed the West Los Angeles Leasing Act of 2016. This Act lays the groundwork for the West Los Angeles VA to return to exclusively serving veterans. It isn’t perfect - but it is a step forward. The West LA VA will be authorized to carry out several types of leases to organizations that will provide assistance to veterans at the facility. This Act will also allow for the development of supportive housing for homeless veterans and their families, as well as provide health care, education, family support, job training, transportation and other services to benefit veterans and their families. This is an important first step towards combating the epidemic of veteran homelessness in Los Angeles and nationwide. I cosponsored this legislation and was pleased to see it finally signed into law by President Obama.
I am working to ensure the VA effectively and efficiently fosters the healthcare needs of San Fernando Valley veterans. Thousands of veterans rely on the Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills for medical care. However, more work is needed to ensure that Valley veterans get the world-class medical care they deserve. I successfully fought to return MRI services to the facility, instead of forcing veterans to travel to West L.A. Over the last few years, thousands of MRIs have been completed in North Hills. Additionally, I helped pass legislation which allocated $988,000 to the Sepulveda facility for improvements. I will continue to work to bring additional medical services to the Sepulveda VA.
Veterans Housing
This Congress, my colleagues and I sent a letter to the Appropriations Committee requesting $47 million for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program. This is a collaborative program between HUD and the VA that provides veterans with housing vouchers from HUD and supportive services, like medical, mental and substance abuse treatment from the VA, to help veterans and their families who are homeless find and sustain permanent housing.
Recognizing Those who Served
In honor of the 100th Anniversary of the American Legion, I co-sponsored H.R. 2519, theAmerican Legion 100th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act. The bill passed both Chambers of Congress unanimously and was signed into law last year. It directs the Treasury Department to mint and issue commemorative coins in recognition and celebration of the 100th anniversary of the American Legion. Proceeds from the sale of the commemorative coins will go toward supporting American Legion programs and efforts to continue their invaluable work on behalf of our nation's veterans and their families.
Help for Valley Veterans
Our office is dedicated to serving Valley veterans. My staff regularly assists veterans who need help with VA disability benefits, veterans’ and survivors’ pensions, VA medical services, burial benefits, obtaining and correcting military records, and awarding overdue or lost military service medals. We have also helped many Valley veterans cut through red tape and delays to get the medical appointments they need. Don’t hesitate to contact my District Office at (818) 501-9200 or 5000 Van Nuys Blvd., Suite 420 Sherman Oaks, CA 91403 for help with your benefits.
My constituent services staff are always on hand at Town Hall Meetings to help address any problems you may be experiencing with any federal agency.
 
Sincerely,
￼

Thune: I Will Vote to Confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court
 
￼
Thune meets with Judge Kavanaugh
 
Sen. Thune released the following statement after meeting with Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court:
 
“After meeting with Judge Kavanaugh, I am confident that the president’s nominee has exactly what it takes to defend the Constitution and call balls and strikes from the bench, which will serve the American people well now and for many years to come. Over the course of his judicial career, he has effectively demonstrated his commitment to deciding cases based on the law, not on his own political opinions or preferred outcomes. With that in mind, I will support his nomination to the Supreme Court this fall, and I hope my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, reach the same conclusion about this well-qualified, mainstream jurist.”

Greg's Treasure State Update
Standing with ICE 

The men and women of ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) work every day to make our country and our communities safer. They secure our borders. They enforce our laws. They protect our safety. 

Last year, ICE agents seized nearly a million pounds of illegal drugs, including 2,400 pounds of fentanyl and 7,000 pounds of heroin. ICE agents arrested more than 127,000 criminal aliens who were charged with weapons offenses, drug crimes, gang-related activity, sexual assault, kidnapping, and murder. 

The U.S. House of Representatives recently passed a resolution I cosponsored, H. Res. 990, in support of ICE. 

With the resolution, the House “(1) expresses its continued support for all United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and personnel who carry out the important mission of ICE; (2) denounces calls for the complete abolishment of ICE; and (3) supports the efforts of all Federal agencies, State law enforcement, and military personnel who bring law and order to our Nation’s borders.” 

The resolution passed 244 to 35. A majority of House Democrats, 133 members of Congress, voted “present.” 

I spoke about the resolution: “Some of my friends across the aisle have called for abolishing ICE. Abolishing ICE is a reckless idea. Abolishing ICE would embolden violent criminals…[and] jeopardize the safety and security of our Montana communities."" 

As America and Montana face an epidemic of drug abuse and addiction, ICE agents and law enforcement officials are working around the clock to keep illegal drugs and dangerous criminals off our streets. 

I stand with them.

2018 Farm Bill ready for harvest 

I worked with hundreds of Montana farmers and ranchers as well as agriculture organizations to ensure the 2018 Farm Bill had Montana’s fingerprints on it. 

The House passed a new Farm Bill that strengthens the safety net for Montana farmers and ranchers as well as improves the health of our forests. 

Recently, the U.S. Senate concluded their work on the Farm Bill, and members of both bodies will now meet to iron out the differences between the bills. It’s important we get a new Farm Bill to President Trump so that our our farmers and ranchers have greater certainty. 

I’ll continue working to ensure we send a strong bill to the President’s desk, so Montana ag producers can keep feeding the world. 


#FarmBillFriday 

I recently joined a group of Montana ag producers to discuss the importance of a new Farm Bill to Montana. We talked about protecting America’s producers from unfair trade practices and providing a strong safety net for Montana’s farmers.

East Rosebud Creek 

East Rosebud Creek is one of Montana’s natural treasures. I met with area residents and local business owners, heard their concerns, and have worked to protect the creek for generations of Montanans to come. 

My bill to conserve approximately 20 miles of the creek as a “wild and scenic river” passed the House and the Senate with broad bipartisan support. 

Private property will not be impacted by this measure.

NEWS FROM WASHINGTON AND ACROSS WEST TEXAS
Dear Friend, 
The House has done its job during the 115th Congress to enact meaningful reforms that ensure a brighter, stronger, and safer America. Last week was another one for the books as we passed legislation to better serve and care for our veterans, as well as legislation that will make healthcare more affordable and patient-centered, and continued Farm Bill negotiations.
A BIG Win for Veterans  
When our soldiers come home from war, it doesn’t mean the conflict for them is over. There is often a battle that continues to rage on inside of them. That is a big reason why each day we lose 20 veterans to suicide. 
I firmly believe reforming the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) through my legislation, the Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William ""Bill"" Mulder (Ret.) Transition Improvement Act of 2018, will help us do a better job equipping our servicemen and women on the front end of their transition to civilian life, so that we can reduce the number of veterans who struggle with unemployment, homelessness and suicide. 
Our freedom fighters risked all for our nation’s safety and security – we must continue fulfilling our promise to care for them when they return home. We owe it to Bill, whom this legislation was named after, and to all ‘who have borne the battle’ to do everything we can to prepare them for civilian life just as we have equipped them for their military careers. I believe this legislation accomplishes that goal and has the potential to save lives, and I am proud to have seen this pass the House last week. See my floor remarks on this BIG win for veterans here.  
￼ 
Victories for Veterans this Congress 
There is not a greater honor for me than to serve those who served us – our veterans. The House Veterans’ Affairs (VA) Committee, on which I serve, has introduced over 400 pieces of legislation to improve care for our veterans. Over 70 of those bills have passed the House and nearly 30 have been signed into law by President Trump. While we have made great strides to reform the VA and its services, we still have a long way to go and our efforts will never stop. Watch here for last week’s press conference where my colleagues and I on the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee highlighted legislation that is improving services and care for our nation’s heroes.
￼ 
Air Force Readiness 
Throughout our nation’s history, our airmen have always answered the call of duty. They should not pay the price because Congress has failed to fulfill ours to fully fund our military and do it on time. Last week the House passed my resolution in support of providing robust, on-time funding to rebuild and modernize the U.S. Air Force. See here for my floor remarks on the resolution. 
We need to give the Air Force the quantity and the certainty of resources that matches the caliber of our airmen and their enormous commitment to that sacred duty of protecting our fellow Americans. If we do this, our Air Force can continue safeguarding the skies, remaining the greatest fighting force in the world. 
￼ 
Patient Centered Health Care 
For years now, Americans have been fed top-down, government-mandated solutions for our health care when the solution is simple: restore market forces and reinstate patient-centered care. During my time in Congress, the House has done its job to strike out of law many of Obamacare’s overreaching regulations and burdensome taxes in order to provide truly affordable, quality health care. Last week my colleagues and I passed legislation that will provide Americans additional relief from Obamacare’s harmful taxes and greater flexibility in making health care choices. 
We expanded access to Health Savings accounts – also knowns as HSAs – so that more families can save their hard-earned money tax-free and make their health care decisions based on their needs, wants and budgets – not be subdued by a government-mandated, one-size-fits-all approach. Used by over 22 million Americans – over twice the amount enrolled in Obamacare – HSAs make it easier for families to save for medical expenses and are proven to significantly reduce health care costs. According to one study, if half of employer-sponsored insurance plans utilized HSAs, Americans could save nearly $60 billion in health care spending annually.
By increasing access to HSAs, we are giving millions of Americans trapped in Obamacare a way out and peace of mind that they don’t have to put off their next doctor’s appointment because they don’t have the cash to pay for it – or that if or when a medical emergency happens, they won’t have to drain their live savings or go into a mountain of debt to recover.  
We are also permanently repealing Obamacare’s medical device tax, which has stifled innovation, hiked prices for consumers, and cost nearly 30,000 jobs. This is in addition to our earlier repeal of Obamacare’s burdensome individual mandate that over half of Americans oppose. No longer are Americans forced to buy government-mandated health insurance they don’t want, don’t need, and often can’t afford to use.
Read more about our legislation that focuses on patient-centered health care here.  
Farm Bill Update 
Members of the Farm Bill conference committee have been selected on the House side, and we will meet with the designated Senators in late August to resolve the differences between the House and Senate versions of the 2018 Farm Bill. 
The House version of the 2018 Farm Bill is strong and should be the benchmark for the final legislation. If enacted, policies in the House Farm Bill would create a stronger safety net and reform the food stamp program to give all recipients the dignity of work. 
Throughout our ongoing negotiations and discussions, I remain committed to fighting for the breadbasket of this country – West Texas. I joined James Hunt with KGNC for a quick update on our progress. Click here for our conversation.  
Economic Strength 
With GDP now at over 4%, our country is experiencing the fastest growing economy in recent history. This goes to show that the American people are better off when they have the heavy hand of government out of their wallets. Tax and regulatory relief is lifting our nation to success. Read FOX News’ write up on our economic success here.  
Family Trip to Washington 
The Hudson family from Lubbock stopped in the office to say hey during their visit in Washington. Thanks for bringing a bit of West Texas up here with you! If your family is planning a trip to our nation’s capital, our office is happy to assist you with setting up a tour of the U.S. Capitol. Click here for more information.

Texas Tech Interns 
It is great to have so many bright Texas Tech University interns on Capitol Hill spending their summer break serving West Texans and our country. Their hard work is surely noticed and appreciated. Wreck ‘em!

8/2/18 16:06,Fighting for Missouri farmers,"￼
Missouri's farmers and ranchers are struggling right now.
From corn and beans to dairy and pork, Missouri is a leading producer of a wide range of agricultural products. But our farmers and ranchers are having a tough go of it these days.
They're the backbone of our state's economy -- but with tariffs causing prices to fall out from underneath them, their livelihoods are on the line.
And now, the worst drought conditions our state has seen since 2012 are further putting their livelihoods at risk. It's so bad that the USDA just designated 19 Missouri counties as natural disaster areas.
So I wanted to let you know I launched a new resource center to connect farmers and ranchers to information they need at this critical time.   Visit the resource page at mccaskill.senate.gov/drought-resource-center. 
The resource center includes information on relief programs available through federal and state governments, and services like a drought monitoring map that is updated weekly. This page also offers a direct link for farmers and ranchers to apply for water supply assistance through the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, and information on tax relief options following a drought.
￼ 
I've always fought hard to make sure Missouri's farmers and ranchers have the resources they need to succeed - including working across the aisle to request drought assistance from the USDA. 
I'm also working hard in Washington to get our agricultural producers the certainty they need: I've always supported the Farm Bill, and this year was no different -- because now more than ever, Missouri's agriculture producers need certainty and the critical safety nets the Farm Bill provides.
I won't stop fighting for Missouri's farmers and ranchers, and my office is here as a resource. Please reach out if there's anything we can do to help.

Friends, 
We’ve conducted more than 30 town halls all over our district, because I believe these are an important part of our system of government of, by and for the people. We've held live town hall meetings in all 15 parishes, and we are scheduling even more. With 760,000 constituents in our district, I've tried to be in every part of our region to reach as many as possible, and when I'm in D.C., my exceptional staff is all over the district on a constant basis.  
If your schedule has not allowed you to make one of these town hall events yet, please know my offices are open Monday-Friday to assist you with any of your concerns.
￼ 
To view a video highlighting our town halls across the district, please click the image above. 
Additionally, due to mass communications restrictions placed on members of Congress during the 90-day span leading up to an election (commonly known as the “blackout period”), I’m sorry to say I won’t be able to update you through my usual methods about upcoming town halls over the next few months. However, the best way I can communicate with you is through my office’s e-newsletter. I encourage you to take a moment to sign up for my updates here. 
I am honored to serve you in Washington and to advance the causes most important to the wonderful people of our area. Thank you for your continued engagement.  
At your service,

8/2/18 15:55,July Highlights from the House,"￼

 
House Approves Welch Amendment to Increase Funding for Lake Champlain Water Quality 

The U.S. House of Representatives approved Peter’s bipartisan amendment to increase funding for the Lake Champlain Basin Program from $4.4 million to 8.4 million. The program supports water quality improvements around the lake and the surrounding watershed. “Lake Champlain is the environmental crown jewel of our region,” Peter explained. “It is central to our cultural heritage and natural history, and an invaluable recreational and economic resource. It is essential that this great lake be protected and preserved for generations to come.” 

￼ 
Peter toured Lake Champlain with the experts who work hard year-round to protect it. 

“The Price of Prescription Drugs is Killing Us” 

Peter introduced legislation that would cut prescription drug costs for families by placing a monthly cap on their out-of-pocket drug costs. “Prescription drugs cure illnesses, relieve pain and save lives. But skyrocketing prices are putting them out of reach for consumers,” Peter insisted. The bill caps prescription drug copays at $250 per month for individuals and $500 per month for families. Senator Elizabeth Warren introduced companion legislation in the Senate.

Medicare for All 

Peter joined 65 House colleagues in announcing the formation of the Congressional Medicare for All Caucus. He spoke with Vermonters who travelled to Washington, D.C. to support the caucus at a press conference outside the Capitol building. “Today we took the important step of founding the first Congressional Medicare for All Caucus. Together, we’ll work for equal access to quality health care for all Americans,” Peter said.

Standing Up for Women’s Health Care 

Joined by Planned Parenthood leaders, health care providers and patients, Peter held a press conference to discuss the threat to women’s health care posed by Congress, the Trump Administration and the Supreme Court. At the press conference, he urged action. “It’s time for all of us who support women’s health care and reproductive rights to stand up and be heard. President Trump and GOP leaders are methodically undermining family planning programs. Funding for Planned Parenthood is under assault. And a new Supreme Court makeup could roll back the hard-fought freedom to choose. Call the White House. And call friends and family in other states and urge them to contact their Members of Congress.”

￼ 
Peter stood with Planned Parenthood to call out President Trump and Republican leaders for undermining women's health and reproductive rights.
Limiting Warrantless Property and Vehicle Searches Near Border   In response to multiple reports of federal agents boarding trains and buses in Vermont to question passengers about their citizenship, Peter introduced legislation to narrow the broad zone of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) authority in the vicinity of U.S. borders. It would reduce the area in which DHS can arbitrarily stop vehicles from 100 miles to 25 miles from the border and prohibit DHS from stopping vehicles at checkpoints further than 10 miles from the border without reasonable suspicion. “A 100-miles unfettered enforcement zone is overly broad and unduly restricts the constitutional rights to privacy and protection against warrantless searches of millions of Americans living in this zone,” Peter insisted. “We must strike a better balance between protecting our national security and preserving our constitutional rights.”  Listening to Vermonters   Peter spent the Fourth of July week travelling across the state to meet with and listen to Vermonters. He met with business owners, held press conferences and convened roundtable discussions. Check out this Facebook album to see what he was up to. 
￼ 
Peter made remarks and marched at the Newport Centennial parade.

8/2/18 14:49,Spotlight on Business: SMW Manufacturing,"￼ 
August 2, 2018

Dear Friend, 
                               
July marked the first anniversary of operations for SMW Manufacturing in Lafayette County.  The company manufactures components that are used by a wide variety of industries including heavy truck, automotive, mining, and construction.     

Rich DesCoteaux, General Manager and Vice President of Operations, said the decision to open a plant in Mississippi was a good one.  ""We offer competitive wages and people want to work for us,"" Rich said.  ""The team has shown they are capable of helping us with existing business and in our pursuit for new business.""

￼

Company officials have announced a $4 million expansion which will create 25 jobs.  It is easy to see why SMW Manufacturing decided to more than double their workforce.  Mississippians are hard workers which enable companies to take steps they might not have taken elsewhere.  With help from their team, Rich said they expect revenue to quadruple over the next five years.  Jeff Busby, Lafayette County Board of Supervisors President, said the company's expansion is what he hoped for.  ""SMW started small, but promised to grow over the next few years,"" Jeff said.  ""They are putting people in Lafayette County to work with great pay and benefits.  We support them and their business growth.""

I look forward to seeing more great achievements at SMW Manufacturing which will be good for the company and for Mississippi.

FARMING: A MISSISSIPPI TRADITION

Farming is a way of life for thousands of Mississippians.  We are thankful for their hard work which remains steady during the good years and the lean ones.  Eric Scott, a Baldwyn native, is a third generation farmer.  Eric grows peanuts and soybeans on 550 acres.  This has been a challenging growing season due to rain, but he is hopeful for a good crop this year.  He is among those closely watching our progress on the 2018 Farm Bill.  

￼
                                            
Like many others, Eric is hopeful for more policies that will enable he and other farmers to gain a return on their investment.  ""I want Brantley, my grandson, to become the fifth generation of this family to manage the farm,"" Eric said.  ""I think President Trump is making progress looking out for our best interests."" 

Through my role on the House Agriculture Committee, I will continue to advocate for legislation that will meet the needs of farmers now, and in the future. 
                                            

HONORING A WORLD WAR II MISSISSIPPI VETERAN

￼

Carl Nance, Jr., entered World War II during his freshman year of college at the University of Mississippi in September 1941.  Mr. Nance was a member of the 94th Infantry which was assigned to lead the advance of two armies after the Battle of the Bulge was contained.  ""It was the coldest winter in 50 years,"" Mr. Nance said.  ""I could tell you a lot of stories that would curl your whiskers.""  Mr. Nance was injured twice in combat which earned him the Purple Heart.  At one time, Mr. Nance said there were more than 2,600 World War II veterans living in Tippah County.  There are only five remaining, including Mr. Nance.  ""I'm so happy to be in that number,"" Mr. Nance said.   

￼

When Mr. Nance completed his military service, he finished college and went back to work at R.L. Nance & Company.  Founded by Mr. Nance's grandfather, the hardware store has been in the family since 1902.  These days, Mr. Nance still works full time.  Soon, he will celebrate his 94th birthday.  Mr. Nance is known for his quick wit and great stories.  We are thankful for his service to our nation and for his many contributions to the citizens of Ripley and Tippah County.

Dear Friend,
The Census is a pillar of American democracy, enshrined in our nation’s Constitution to ensure a fair and accurate count of all people living within the United States. The Trump Administration decided to add a new question about citizenship in the Census. It is a calculated move designed to discourage non-citizens from responding and to leave traditionally undercounted communities even further behind financially. This decision is also intended to result in fewer Representatives from blue states that have large immigrant populations and more Members of Congress from red states. This transparently political move would violate the government’s constitutional responsibility to conduct an accurate count of people living in the United States.
Americans have the ability to make their voices heard on the addition of a citizenship question in the 2020 Census. The Commerce Department is accepting comments from the public here.
Including a citizenship question in the 2020 Census will suppress participation and result in inaccurate data that does not reflect the true makeup of our community. It will also reduce the security, safety, and health of vulnerable communities by depriving them of needed federal resources.
It is imperative we protect the constitutional directive for an accurate Census from being subverted for political purposes and to protect the right to be counted and represented in our democracy.
I encourage you to share your thoughts:

CONSERVATIVE ACTION ALERT - 8/2/18
 Fighting to Protect the Unborn In June, I signed a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) urging them to finalize a rule that will prohibit taxpayer-funding for abortions and protect the conscience rights of health care providers who do not wish to perform them. Unfortunately, the regulations that control these things have not been updated since 1999, which is why I joined with other conservative, pro-life Congressmen on this letter asking that the proposed rule be finalized and implemented as quickly as possible. 
Keeping the Trump Economic Effort On Track With Legislation to Help Small Businesses Grow The small businesses of today become the Amazons, Googles and Microsofts of tomorrow. That is why I introduced the “Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act,” which would make it easier for entrepreneurs to obtain the capital they need to launch their companies and to go and stay public. Increasing access to capital is vital to helping President Trump sustain our current economic growth and ensuring that we are able to compete globally with countries like China. Our bill passed House on July 17th by a near unanimous vote of 406-4.
The Best Economy in a Generation It was just a few years ago that President Obama claimed high unemployment and low GDP growth could become the “new normal” for our economy. Less than two years under President Trump and a Republican congress, and we are already seeing record-low unemployment claims and GDP growth over 4%. Our economy is the strongest it’s been in a generation thanks to tax reform and doing away with onerous regulations that burden American families and our local businesses.
￼
Supporting Those Who Keep Us Safe Last month, the House of Representatives passed a resolution supporting our Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Here is what I had to say after that vote:

Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Hateful, xenophobic attacks on voting rights, immigrants, and minority communities continue. The administration is forging ahead to include a question about citizenship status on the 2020 Census.
This dangerous change will make immigrant communities less likely to respond—something the Census Bureau itself highlighted in late 2017. I believe the administration's policies are undermining the accuracy of the Census by further injecting fear and distrust into our most vulnerable communities, pushing them deeper into the shadows.
The Census must be an accurate count of everyone.
Americans can make their voices heard on this critical issue. The Commerce Department is currently accepting comments from the public on the addition of a citizenship question in the 2020 Census. You can submit your thoughts here.
In Congress, I’m committed to holding Trump and his administration accountable and am fighting to ensure a full, fair, and accurate Census. I’ve joined my colleagues to introduce legislation that prohibit any questions on citizenship status from appearing on the Census and require advance notice to Congress before adjustments to Census questions are made. I am also working with my fellow Congressional Census Caucus members to increase funding for the Census Bureau and file ‘friend of the court’ briefs challenging Trump’s authority to add a citizenship question to the Census.
The right to be counted, and represented, is enshrined in our Constitution and supported in both Democratic and Republican administrations. The integrity and accuracy of the Census must be protected.

Courage,

NYC Keep Families Together March
I joined thousands of people from near and far at the NYC Keep Families Together March to let the Administration know that immigrant families must be protected at all costs. In addition, on July 25th, ahead of the July 26th Court-Ordered Deadline, I stood with the Tri-Caucus Members of Congress to demand the immediate reunification of children separated from their parents at the border. Although over a thousand families have been reunited, there are hundreds of families still in separation. Have you or a loved one been negatively affected by the recent ""Zero Tolerance"" policy? Please share your story by calling our office at 718-287-1142 or by replying to this email.

A Better Deal on Housing
We're in the midst of a crippling housing crisis. Rent & homelessness are at the highest points they’ve been in our lifetimes. That is why public housing is such a critical part of our nation’s social safety net, providing safe, decent, and affordable housing for approximately 1.1 million families nation-wide and nearly 60,000 units in Brooklyn alone. I stood with my fellow Brooklynite, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, members of the New York Congressional Delegation, and other Brooklyn elected officials in demanding A BETTER DEAL.

It’s a commitment and obligation that I have to give back to the nation that gave me my parents, and gave me the values and the drive and determination to be a voice for the people of the community and by extension the entire region of the Caribbean.

Important Updates
USCIS
On July 24, 2018, President Trump signed the Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act of 2018 (the Workforce Act), extending the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)-Only Transitional Worker program (the CW-1 program) through 2029 and increasing the CW-1 cap for fiscal year (FY) 2019. The CW-1 program allows employers within the CNMI to apply for permission to employ foreign (nonimmigrant) workers who are otherwise ineligible to work in the CNMI under other nonimmigrant worker categories.
Effective immediately, CW-1 employers must pay a mandatory $50 fraud prevention and detection fee with each petition, in addition to other current fees. USCIS will reject any petition received after July 24, 2018 that includes incorrect or insufficient fees. This new fraud prevention and detection fee does not apply to CW petitions already filed and pending with USCIS as of July 24, 2018.
Importantly, the Workforce Act will require CNMI employers seeking CW-1 workers to enroll in E-Verify and comply with the requirements of the E-Verify program. 
The Workforce Act raises the CW-1 cap for FY 2019 from 4,999 to 13,000, and provides new CW-1 caps for subsequent fiscal years.

U.S. Census Bureau
Constituents may receive two of the following surveys in the mail from the U.S. Census Bureau: the 2017 Annual Business Survey (ABS) and the 2017 Economic Census.
Every five years, the Census Bureau conducts the Economic Census; the most comprehensive measure of the Nation’s businesses and economy.  The Economic Census serves as the statistical benchmark for current economic activity by informing the Gross Domestic Product and the Producer Price Index.  It is also used by businesses, policymakers, governments, and communities for economic development, business decisions, and strategic planning.  The business community’s participation is essential to obtain reliable, comprehensive results that accurately represent our rapidly changing economy.
The ABS provides the only comprehensive source of data on businesses and business owners by sex, ethnicity, race, and veteran status. This survey measures new business topics, such as research and development, innovation, and technology.  To reduce the burden on businesses, this survey will replace the Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs, the Survey of Business Owners – employer component, and the Business R&D and Innovation Survey for Microbusinesses.  Statistics from the ABS will be valuable for government officials, economic and social analysts, entrepreneurs, and researchers.  Estimates produced on owner demographic data may be used to assess business needs, allocate available program resources, and create a framework for planning, directing, and assessing programs that disadvantaged groups.  The deadline to respond to the ABS is August 9, 2018.
Information provided for both the 2017 Economic Census and the 2017 Annual Business Survey is kept confidential by law.  The Census Bureau is required by Section 9 of Title 13 to keep respondent information confidential and use responses only to produce statistics.  The Census Bureau is not permitted to publicly release responses in a way that could identify a respondent’s business, organization, or institutions.  Per the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015, respondent data are protected from cybersecurity risks through screening of the systems that transmit data.  Please visit https://www.census.gov/EconomicCensus-congressional-resources or https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/abs.html to access frequently asked questions and other material on these surveys. 
Please call the District Office and speak with a constituent services representative with any questions or concerns at 718-287-1142.
Brownsville Plan 1-Year Anniversary
New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) Commissioner Maria Torres-Springer joined the Mayor’s Office of the Chief Technology Officer (MOCTO), the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice (MOCJ) and the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) to announce several updates on commitments made in the Brownsville Plan, which include development plans for over 880 units to be built on three City-owned sites identified through the Brownsville Request for Proposals (RFP), as well as the installation of innovative, community-driven streetscape upgrades to improve public safety as identified through the NYCx Co-Lab Challenge: Safe and Thriving Nighttime Corridors. NYCx Co-Lab Challenges are open competitions co-developed by City agencies and community representatives to address the most pressing concerns of underserved New York City neighborhoods.
For far too long Brownsville, home of some of Brooklyn’s most brilliant minds, has been left out of our city’s technological innovations. I am thrilled to hear that development has begun for our proposed Brownsville Cultural Arts Center and Apartments. The new cultural center will be Brownsville’s hub for tech and arts and will also serve as a collaborative space for local organizations to convene. The mixed-use center will play a role in addressing the affordable housing crisis by allotting 230 units to extremely low-income and formerly homeless residents. I am proud of the role my office has played in bringing this plan to fruition and look forward to being intimately involved in the development of the Brownsville Cultural Arts Center and Apartments.

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
To help support veterans who are interested in new careers, Senators Tammy Baldwin and John Hoeven (R-ND) have introduced bipartisan legislation that will make flight-training services available for veterans to become commercial airline pilots. 
“America’s veterans have bravely served our nation and we have a shared responsibility to make sure their service and sacrifice is honored,” said Senator Baldwin. “Our veterans have also earned every opportunity to be productive and successful after completing their military service. This legislation increases opportunities for veterans looking to pursue flight training and careers as commercial airline pilots. We have a real need for qualified pilots and if we make the training more available to veterans we can provide them with a good paying job.”
The bipartisan American Aviator Act will authorize grant funding through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to support training opportunities for veterans who are not already military pilots. Veterans participating in the program will receive flight training necessary to become a commercial pilot and receive other certifications, including to work as a certified flight instructor. Senator Baldwin’s legislation helps ensure there are enough qualified pilots in the future to continue providing safe and reliable air service to rural airports across the country. 
Fox Valley Technical College, Air Wisconsin, Appleton Airport, the Air Line Pilots Association and the Regional Airline Association agree Senator Baldwin’s bipartisan bill takes the right approach and support the American Aviator Act: 
“The American Aviator Act provides Veterans with solid high paying jobs while ensuring the viability of air transportation throughout our country and beyond. Veterans bring all the right elements to the table,” said Dr. Susan May, President of Fox Valley Technical College. “Their work ethic, determination, and professionalism make them the perfect candidates to help move our air transportation industry forward.” 
“The aviation industry is in dire need of qualified aircraft pilots. The American Aviator Act taps into a strong applicant pool of future pilots, who may otherwise not be able to afford financially to get into the industry,” said Jared Huss, Chief Instructor and Aeronautics Department Chair at Fox Valley Technical College. “This act does two important things; supports our Veterans and supports the stability of our communities’ air service.” 
“The American Aviator Act is a great way to support our military veterans by providing them an effective and efficient pathway to becoming an airline pilot,” said Bob Frisch, COO of Air Wisconsin Airlines. “The Act also helps to address the growing pilot shortage in the airline industry. These are two objectives shared by Air Wisconsin, which will benefit our employees and passengers in Wisconsin. We greatly appreciate Senator Baldwin’s leadership on this important issue.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  August 2, 2018

ICYMI: Rep. Bergman Continues to Deliver for Education and Workforce Development Training

Washington - On July 31st, President Trump signed The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act into law. 

This new law supports career and technical education, giving states and local communities more flexibility to design career education programs. It also simplifies the requirements states have to follow when applying for federal funds. The law streamlines the application process, aligning it with the state workforce development plan under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. This updated submittal process allows state leaders to focus more time and resources on preparing students for successful careers — not on duplicative or overly prescriptive federal requirements.

Rep. Bergman stated, ""The bipartisan work done to get this bill on the President's desk and signed into law ensures the next generation reaches their full potential. From easing over-burdensome regulations that previously kept communities from accessing critical CTE resources, to increasing the cap on the amount of money states can set aside for use in rural areas like our district--this is a win for education and for training our future workforce.""

Friends, 
Meeting folks in the 23rd District of Texas is the best part of my job. Here's a few things I've been up to this week! 
It was great to stop by yesterday's veterans cybersecurity training at Webster College put together by IBM and Corporate America Supports You (CASY). I applaud IBM for their efforts to provide cybersecurity training and certification for our veterans, so these brave men and women who fought for our freedoms can smoothly transition into meaningful jobs that allow them to continue to protect our nation against global threats.  
￼ 
Our national parks are a jewel of the rest of the world, and I've seen firsthand the immeasurable environmental, cultural and economic impacts of TX-23's 8 national parks. We have a responsibility to care for these natural treasures, which is why I introduced the bipartisan Restore our Parks & Public Lands Act in Congress last week.  
￼ 
The 90th Infantry Division ""Tough Ombres"" have a 100+ year history going back to August 5, 1917, and have taken part in every major conflict our nation has been involved in since WWI. It was great to speak to a few folks from the 90th Infantry Division Association as we remembered together their commitment to freedom and dedication to our great nation.  
￼ 
Our state's agriculture industry alone supports more than 3.75 million Texas jobs, earning $160 billion in wages. Thank you to the National Cotton Council for having me at your Summer Board Meeting, and for your hard work putting the clothes on the backs of folks all across America.  
￼ 
In case you missed my most recent Hurd on the Hill column, I'm proud to have helped ensure that an estimated 32,000 additional households in TX-23 will be able to receive assistance from LIHEAP, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Learn more, here. 
￼ 
As always, please don't hesitate to reach out to my office with any questions or concerns. You can receive further updates on my work for you by following me on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube at @HurdontheHill, and be sure to share this email with your friends in TX-23! 
Have a great rest of your week!

8/2/18 10:57,DHS Secretary Nielsen Must Go,"The Durbin Report: A message from Senator Richard J. Durbin
￼ 


Fellow Illinoisan, 
This week, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing to examine the impact of the Trump Administration’s disgraceful family separation policy. This policy shows the extremes this Administration will go to punish families fleeing horrific gang and sexual violence. The American Academy of Pediatrics called this policy “government-sanctioned child abuse."" 
Under Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen’s watch and leadership, nearly 2,700 children were separated from their parents, and more than 700 children still have not been reunited with their families – including more than 400 whose parents were apparently deported and more than 90 whose parents cannot be located at all. What will become of these children and their parents, who Border Patrol agents sadly called, “deleted family units”? 
￼ 
DURBIN CALLS ON DHS SECRETARY NIELSEN TO RESIGN 
In the name of these “deleted family units,” 711 “lost children,” and common decency, I called on the architect of this humanitarian disaster, DHS Secretary Nielsen, to resign. Someone needs to accept responsibility for this catastrophe that a federal judge called, ""a chaotic circumstance of the government’s own making.”  
We can have border security without bullying. We can be safe without treating toddlers as terrorists. I hope that this week's hearing is the start of a bipartisan effort to confront this Administration and end this crisis. It is the least that we can do for these “deleted families” and lost children.  
Sincerely,  
U.S. Senator Dick Durbin

Farm Bill Passes Senate, Heads to Conference
This week, the Senate voted for the Farm Bill to head to conference, where conferees from the Senate and the House will meet to come up with a compromise between the House and Senate Farm Bills. I am already busy meeting with members of the conference, as well as Agriculture Committee leadership from the House and Ranking Member Debbie Stabenow, to come up with legislation that will pass in both the House and Senate.  
￼
 
Earlier this month, the Senate passed the Farm Bill with a vote of 86-11. This was a historic vote, our bill received more votes than any other Farm Bill at this stage. I am pleased this important legislation, which provides certainty and predictability for farmers, passed with such strong bipartisan support. I will continue working to ensure the 2018 Farm Bill becomes law before the current legislation expires in September.
 
￼
 
This month, I also discussed the Farm Bill with U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. During our meeting we also discussed the agriculture economy and trade.
 
Receiving Washington International Trade Association Award  
￼
 
Earlier this month, I was honored to receive the Congressional Leadership Award from the Washington International Trade Association for my contributions to international trade.
As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, and as a senior member of the Senate Committee on Finance, which has jurisdiction over trade, I have been outspoken on the benefits of increased access to foreign markets for American farmers and ranchers. 
Just last year, the total value of U.S. agricultural exports was more than $138 billion. That’s a roughly 200 percent increase from when NAFTA took effect. Clearly, free trade is not only good for U.S. agriculture, it is absolutely essential. 
I believe we should be aggressively seeking new agreements and trade opportunities around the world and then work to meet that demand. I have actively taken my concerns regarding today’s trade issues straight to President Donald Trump, U.S. Trade Representative Bob Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. 
 
Supporting Judge Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court  
￼
 
Last week, I met with Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Following the meeting, I announced my support for Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court.
Judge Kavanaugh has a great legal mind and a solid reputation. After meeting with him, I am confident he will uphold the values of the Constitution to the highest standard. 
Aside from discussing his work during the past 12 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, we also discussed our coaching backgrounds. Judge Kavanaugh currently coaches basketball for both of his daughters, and I coached basketball for both of my daughters! I appreciated that special time in my life and was pleased to learn of his enjoyment for coaching and his fondness for seeing his girls succeed. 
Judge Kavanaugh is a good man, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to meet with him and vote on his merits, instead of obstructing his nomination because they do not like the President.
 
KC-46 Tankers Heading to McConnell Air Force Base  
￼
 
This month, I had a great discussion with U.S. Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson where we discussed the first new KC-46 tankers that are heading to McConnell Air Force Base this fall.
McConnell Air Force Base is scheduled to receive the first four Boeing KC-46s for delivery and will be home to a total of 36 of the aircraft. 
Since 2001, I’ve been leading the charge in Kansas to replace the Air Force’s aging tanker fleet with an American-made plane. 
The KC-46 replaces the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, a fleet of aircraft more than 60 years old. 
 
Accepting Intern Applications for Fall 2018  
￼
 
My office in Washington, D.C. offers internships throughout the year and we are now accepting internship applications for fall 2018. The internship program provides a unique opportunity for students to work closely with my staff and assist my office in representing Kansans in Congress and experience the federal government in action.

The breathtaking beauty of the sea is what draws millions to America’s coastal communities, like ours in Southwest Florida. That’s why it’s vital to do everything possible to protect it.   A bipartisan bill I co-sponsored, the “Save Our Seas Act” passed the U.S. House last week.   It will help keep our oceans clean and safe. Read about the bill here.   Over 100 million marine animals die every year due to plastic debris in the ocean. Sea turtles are especially at risk,  including the endangered Loggerhead and Green Sea Turtles, both of which are native to Southwest Florida. 
Plastic debris spans five million square miles, putting coastal ecosystems in jeopardy.   Protecting the environment is especially important in Florida, which is home to some of our country’s greatest treasures and natural resources.      Let me know if you agree that keeping our oceans clean and safe should be a high priority.   Vern

Make Your Voice Heard on the Addition of a Citizenship Question in the 2020 Census

August 2, 2018   Dear friend, 
Our Founders enshrined the Census as a pillar of our democracy, ensuring that all Americans are equally counted and represented. I believe the Administration’s plan to add a new citizenship question violates the clear constitutional mandate to provide an accurate count of every person living in the United States. This dangerous change will inject fear and distrust into vulnerable communities and cause traditionally undercounted communities to be even further under-represented financially excluded and left behind.   Americans are able to make their voices heard on the addition of a citizenship question in the 2020 Census. The Commerce Department is accepting comments from the public here. 
￼
Click on the picture above to watch House Democrats taking a stand against efforts to undermine the 2020 Census.   
This decision starves communities of vital funding, threatening the security, safety, and health of American’s families. It also tramples over the views of former Census Bureau directors of both parties and the Census bureau itself, which recently released a study that advised against this change. The President is advancing, in my view, an anti-immigrant agenda and depriving local communities throughout the nation of their deserved resources from the federal government.   Democrats are taking action to protect the strong, accurate, nonpartisan Census that our democracy and our Constitution demand.  As the Ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Subcommittee which funds the Census Bureau, I am fighting hard to restore the 2020 Census to its original mission.  In the past few months, I offered an amendment in the Appropriations Committee to prevent the Department of Commerce from using funds to implement this misguided effort, and introduced the 2020 Census Improving Data and Enhanced Accuracy Act with Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney. This legislation seeks to protect the integrity of this critical institution of our democracy.   It is imperative to protect every person’s right to be counted, and represented, in our democracy. I encourage you submit your comments online and make your voice heard. 
Best regards, 
Congressman José E. Serrano

August 2018
Dear Friend, 
I currently serve as the Vice Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee.  Our Committee has worked hard throughout this Congress to improve the lives of Veterans.  Serving those who have served our nation is not a Democrat or Republican issue, which is why we have a long-standing tradition of working in a bi-partisan fashion and getting things done.   Over 30 Veteran-related bills have been signed into law since January 2017.  We have accomplished a great deal so far, and we will achieve even more in the coming months because we will not rest until Veterans have access to the high quality care and benefits they have earned. It is my privilege to provide you with a few highlights below:
Improving Access
	•	Our work to finally rectify the injustice that kept Blue Water Navy Veterans from accessing care and benefits is something that will make a tangible difference in the lives of many Veterans.  These Veterans cannot afford to wait any longer.   
	•	With half a million Veterans waiting on a VA decision about their disability claims as of 2017, modernizing claims was extremely important.  It has been a year since this critical legislation was signed into law.  There is more that needs to be done because Veterans are still waiting way too long; however, this law is a huge step in the right direction.
	•	The MISSION Act is another huge victory for Veterans who were struggling to navigate the VA CHOICE and community care programs.  This new law ensures Veterans receive timely and convenient access to care, whether through the VA or a community provider- a decision which will be made by the Veteran and his or her doctor. 
Improving Educational Benefits for Veterans
	•	Through the Forever GI Bill, we expanded educational benefits and removed the time restriction for use.
	•	My SITREP bill, which has passed the House and is awaiting Senate action, will also ensure Veterans are not penalized when a bureaucracy delays processing of the GI payment. 
Ensuring accountability and Oversight of the VA
	•	The VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which was signed into law one year ago helps achieve this goal by streamlining the process of firing or disciplining ineffective senior VA employees while expanding protections for employees who report wrong doing.
In addition to these new laws, the House has passed a bill that is very near and dear to my heart, the Transition Improvement Act, which I cosponsored.  We spend a minimum of six months preparing service personnel for their military assignments and a maximum of one week preparing them for successful reintegration into civilian society.  We owe these brave men and women more than that, and local Veterans from our community who were able to provide direct input into this bill, tell me that this is one of the most serious challenges currently facing those exiting the military.   My hope is that it will become law soon. 
Also, I speak with Veterans on a regular basis who lack access to basic dental care because the VA dental benefits are severely limited.  I believe oral health is a vital component of overall wellness.  There are multiple studies which indicate that providing dental care to patients with certain chronic health conditions actually reduces the cost of treating the underlying medical condition.  If proven within the Veteran population, the VA could provide desperately needed dental care to Veterans while saving money treating chronic health conditions for which they are currently financially obligated. I have sponsored legislation that would create a pilot project to demonstrate this potential win-win scenario.  Additionally, I have filed legislation that would allow Veterans to opt to use their VA benefit at a community health center.  Community health centers offer primary care, mental health and dental services.    
One final important bill I want to mention to you is the Protection for Veterans Burn Pit Exposure Act of 2018, which I introduced last week.  I am joined in this bi-partisan effort by Representative Raul Ruiz, a physician and public health expert by trade.  This bill seeks to remedy an injustice that is keeping sick Veterans from being able to access the medical care and disability compensation benefits to which they should be entitled.  It is a widely known fact that Veterans serving in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom were exposed to toxic chemicals in burn pits during their deployments.  Many of these Veterans are now battling a wide range of diseases, some of which have proven fatal.   One of the criteria for the VA to provide medical care and disability benefits is a Veteran proving that his/her condition is directly related to military service. Currently, the VA does not recognize toxic burn pit exposure as a contributing factor to the development of the illnesses these Veterans are facing.  The VA has begun a database of exposed Veterans in order to study whether or not there is a causal link between exposure and certain illnesses; however, its plan does little to help Veterans who are suffering now. This critical legislation will provide a presumption of service-connection for exposure to toxic burn pits, which will enable the Veterans battling illness to immediately access VA medical care and disability benefits.  It is not a coincidence that so many of the exposed Veterans are all suffering from the same diseases. We saw similar patterns with Veterans who had been exposed to Agent Orange in earlier wars.  Sadly, many of those Veterans died while the VA took decades to study the issue. Burn pit toxin exposure is the Agent Orange of this generation. It is a moral imperative that we learn from the mistakes in the way Agent Orange was handled. These Veterans are suffering and they don’t have time to wait any longer.  We can’t change the fact that they were exposed and are sick, but we have the power to get them the help they need.  Too often we see bureaucracy get in the way of doing the right thing for our heroes; this can’t be one of those times.  I will not stop fighting on their behalf until they get the benefits and medical treatment they deserve.
Again, it is a privilege to serve those who have served our great nation.  They always have been and always will be my highest priority in Congress.  Thank you for allowing me to provide you with this update on some of the things we have accomplished on their behalf this Congress.
Sincerely,
￼ 
Gus Bilirakis

Dear Friend, 
As Oregon Experiences Another Summer of Fire and Smoke, I Continue to Push for Reforms 
￼ 
Handmade signs like this one I saw outside of Rogue River say it all. 
First and foremost, the brave firefighters putting themselves in harm’s way to protect people and property in Oregon deserve our gratitude. Yet again, people are being told to stay inside, community events have been cancelled, and businesses and tourism are suffering from the worst air quality in the nation because of wildfires. 
I’m seeing it firsthand in Rogue River and Medford, in the eastern part of the Gorge and all across Central and Southern Oregon…we’re experiencing another summer filled with smoke, fire, evacuations, and destruction. 
￼ 
In Medford, I called on the Senate to join the House in securing much needed fire prevention and forest restoration authorities in the 2018 Farm Bill. 
Tuesday in Medford, I called on the Senate to support what the House passed as part of the Farm Bill. These changes would allow us to harvest burned dead trees while they still have value and use the proceeds to pay for replanting a new, healthy forest for the next generation. You can’t get more common-sense than this. Our provisions also provide new authorities for better landscape management to thin the forests, remove excess fuel loads. and get back in balance with Mother Nature.   
The Senate has the opportunity to embrace these changes and help save our forests and our communities from deadly destruction.

Investigation Seeks to End Fraud and Abuse Within Opioid Addiction Treatment Industry
￼ 
The Energy and Commerce Committee -- where I serve as Chairman -- continues to investigate potential fraud and abuse within the opioid addiction treatment industry. Click here to view my remarks about ensuring patients and families are not taken advantage of when seeking help. 
Combating the opioid crisis continues to be a top priority of mine in Congress. In June, the House passed my legislation -- the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act -- to address all angles of this crisis that is taking the lives of more people than traffic accidents. While this bill marks the largest legislative effort in history to combat a single drug crisis, our fight is far from over. Last week, the Energy and Commerce Committee held a hearing to examine potential fraud and abuse within the opioid addiction treatment industry. 
Our committee has led a year-long bipartisan investigation into patient brokering, a practice through which individuals are paid by treatment facilities for successfully enrolling people suffering from addiction in their treatment programs. With an increased demand for addiction treatment, some providers have reportedly employed a host of aggressive and sometimes deceptive advertising tactics to reach potential patients, and we’ve seen evidence of that behavior through our investigation. 
I heard from a father in southern Oregon who told me about the troubling experience he had when his son was seeking treatment for addiction. The recovery center that was located in another state seemed more interested in cashing a check rather than caring for his son. That is unacceptable, and I am committed to ensuring patients and families in need are not taken advantage of when seeking help.

Thanks to the young leaders with Oregon FFA for taking the time to meet with me on Capitol Hill. Keep up the good work! 
Meeting with students from Oregon who make the long trip to the nation’s capital is always a pleasure. Recently, I met with a group of Oregon Future Farmers of America (FFA) officers who were visiting Capitol Hill. Oregon FFA Association does an excellent job of preparing students across our state to be our nation’s next generation of ag leaders. Thank you to the students from Oregon FFA for taking the time to meet with me, and keep up the good work!
FCC Chairman Talks Rural Broadband Expansion at Energy and Commerce Hearing 
￼ 
At a recent Energy and Commerce Committee hearing, I asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman about what actions he was taking to help close the “digital divide” in rural America.  Click here to view my full remarks. 
Expanding high-speed broadband to rural communities is essential for our economies, access to healthcare services, and educational opportunities.  While we’ve made considerable progress, much work remains. That’s why I’m keeping pressure on the FCC, including by having the FCC Commissioners testify before my committee last week. The Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, discussed solutions to connect people in Oregon and across the country with Internet access regardless of where they live.
In June, Chairman Pai came to eastern Oregon to discuss efforts to improve connectivity in rural communities, including making sure patients in remote areas have access to the best doctors through technology like telehealth. During the hearing, Chairman Pai noted that the only way some people in rural communities will get adequate health care is through telemedicine, and that the FCC is committed to continuing initiatives to strengthen telehealth.
I will continue to work alongside Chairman Pai and the FCC to connect unserved communities with the digital age. I worked hard to pass into law the RAY BAUM’S Act, which reauthorized the FCC for the first time in 28 years and gave the agency additional tools to enhance broadband expansion.

Wallowa County Commissioner Todd Nash (to my right) and Wasco County rancher Keith Nantz (to my left) of the Oregon Cattlemen’s Association discuss broadband expansion in rural Oregon.  
Shortly before I held a hearing on broadband expansion with Chairman Pai, I met with ranchers from rural Oregon to discuss ranching issues and how we can better connect rural communities with the Internet. I am very supportive of their efforts and appreciated them taking the time to meet with me on Capitol Hill to discuss how we can ensure rural communities realize the benefits of the digital age.
Oregon Students Accepted to U.S. Service Academies 
Seven students from across our district have been accepted to the prestigious United States service academies. My Service Academy Nomination Board -- retired military officers who interview potential candidates for the service academies -- recommended each student based on their academic performance, extracurricular involvement, and character. I was proud to officially nominate each of these students for acceptance in December 2017.
I want to congratulate each of these remarkable young leaders for their much-deserved acceptance to our nation’s service academies. They have earned this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity through years of hard work, dedication, and commitment to character. To learn more about the nominees accepted to the service academies, please click here.
Students who are interested in learning more about service academy nominations can visit my website at https://walden.house.gov/academynominations.  Applications are now being accepted until October 2018.

Dear Friend, 
The House of Representatives has begun its August recess, a period that permits Members like me to spend more time working in our districts and hearing from our constituents face to face. With that in mind, I’m sending this newsletter to update you about Congressional activity in the last few months that affects Memphis. As always, I appreciate hearing from you about issues that concern you and the 9th Congressional District. Keep reading to learn more and follow me on Twitter and Facebook to see more updates as they happen.   My Duties in the 115th Congress U.S. DOT Awards $71.2 Million to Improve Lamar Avenue Corridor Drone Program Comes to Memphis Introducing the NEWBORN Act Working to Reduce Crime and Reform the Criminal Justice System Passage of SOAR Act Committee Approval of Judge Russell B. Sugarmon Post Office FAA Inquiry leads to Safety Audit Passage of Environmental Initiatives NATO Support Resolution Bringing More Federal Grants Money to Memphis Signing Up for “Congress On Your Corner” and this e-Newsletter Weekly Health Tip Quote of the Week 
 

My Duties in the 115th Congress   ￼   I have a variety of responsibilities in Congress representing Tennessee's 9th Congressional District. I am the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice where issues such as civil rights, constitutional rights, constitutional amendments and Presidential violations of the Constitution's anti-corruption provisions are regular subjects of concern. I am also a senior member of the full Judiciary Committee; a senior member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, where I serve on the Aviation Subcommittee, as well as the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit and the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials; a member of the Committee on Ethics; and a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as the Helsinki Commission, which promotes international human rights. I also belong to a variety of caucuses and task forces, including the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the Medicare for All Caucus, the Congressional Biomedical Research Caucus, the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence, the Caucus on Infant Health and Safety, the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus and several caucuses devoted to various illnesses and medical conditions, such as diabetes, autism, cancers and HIV/AIDS.
U.S. DOT Awards $71.2 Million to Improve Lamar Avenue Corridor  
￼
On June 5th, the U.S. Department of Transportation awarded a $71.2 million Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA) grant for roadway repairs and capacity upgrades for Lamar Avenue, a regionally and nationally important intermodal freight corridor in America’s Distribution Hub, Memphis. This project has been a top priority of mine during my entire tenure in Congress and will be a game-changer for Memphis, creating jobs and enhancing future growth. I was happy my work literally paid off for Memphis.   Drone Program Comes to Memphis   ￼
In May, I joined Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao and officials with the Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority for the announcement that Memphis will be a national test site for integrating unmanned aircraft systems, commonly referred to as aerial drones, into the national airspace. The airport authority was one of 150 applicants for the pilot program which it sought in partnership with the City of Memphis and its police and fire departments, Agricenter International, the University of Memphis, the Tennessee Department of Transportation Division of Aeronautics, FedEx, GE subsidiaries AirXOS and Avitas, Intel, Flirtey, 901Drones, Express Drone Parts and ForeverReady Productions. This puts Memphis on the map as a major player in the nascent drone industry and will advance our stature as a center for testing this cutting-edge technology.    Introducing the NEWBORN Act
Also in June, I introduced legislation to address America’s unacceptably high infant mortality rate with concrete measures in the Nationally Enhancing the Wellbeing of Babies through Outreach and Research Now (NEWBORN) Act. The legislation would create infant mortality-focused pilot programs in the highest-risk areas of the country and would address one or more of the top five reasons for infant mortality: birth defects, preterm birth and low birth weight, sudden infant death syndrome, maternal pregnancy complications and/or injuries to the infant. Memphis and Shelby County have some of the highest infant mortality rates in the country. Infant mortality is a reflection of our nation’s overall health and its commitment to its children. We need to do more to assure women have the resources and information they need to deliver healthy babies and raise them to become healthy and productive adults.   Working to Reduce Crime and Reform the Criminal Justice System   One of my highest priorities in Congress is to help reduce crime in Memphis and make our criminal justice system more fair. I have cosponsored numerous bills to fight gun violence including the Assault Weapons Ban and the Gun Show Loophole Closing Act.  I have also introduced legislation to encourage the use of police body cameras (the Police CAMERA Act), encourage the collection of accurate statistics on police shootings (the National Statistics on Deadly Force Transparency Act), and encourage the use of independent prosecutors for police shootings (the Police Training and Independent Review Act).  I have also introduced legislation to give nonviolent ex-offenders a chance to become productive members of society (the Fresh Start Act), worked to fight the racially disproportionate impact of outdated marijuana laws, and cosponsored the No Money Bail Act to stop the use of money bail as a condition of pretrial release.  While these efforts remain bottled up by the House Majority, I am continuing to fight for them.   Passage of the SOAR Act   Earlier this year, the House passed my Stop, Observe, Ask and Respond (SOAR) to Health and Wellness Training Program bill aimed at detecting ongoing human trafficking activity. The bill is the result of an event I held at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis in 2016 to discuss and promote human trafficking awareness training that was attended by first responders, health care workers, faith-based groups, educators and state and local officials. Their energy inspired me to join with colleagues to provide $4 million a year in training grants to make health professions alert to possible instances of human trafficking and to detect the tell-tale signs of those who have been held in captivity.    Committee Approval of Judge Russell B. Sugarmon Post Office  ￼   In May, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform passed my bill naming the post office at 1325 Autumn Avenue for Judge Russell B. Sugarmon, a tireless trailblazer and advocate for Civil Rights and a highly regarded attorney and judge. I look forward to the full House and Senate passage of the bill in the weeks ahead and hope that it will ultimately be enacted.   FAA Inquiry leads to Safety Audit   ￼   I introduced the Seat Egress in Air Travel (SEAT) Act requiring the Federal Aviation Administration to establish minimum seat sizes and distances between rows to help address concerns about the safe evacuation of airplanes in emergencies which passed the House as part of the FAA’s reauthorization. Early this Spring, I pressed the FAA in a Congressional hearing to comply with a U.S. Court of Appeals order to address the issue of seat size and evacuation safety and in June, I learned of a decision by the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Transportation (DOT) to audit the FAA’s oversight of the actual time it takes to safely evacuate various aircraft models. I’m proud that my efforts are leading to tangible safety improvements for the flying public.   Passage of Environmental Initiatives in Spending Bills   ￼    Also in June, two environmentally friendly amendments that I introduced passed the House as part of a federal spending package covering annual Energy & Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations. One of my amendments prohibits the House of Representatives from using funds to purchase plastic drinking straws for its cafeterias and food service areas. The other provides an addition $2 million to the Department of Energy's SuperTruck II Program to promote more fuel efficiency in freight trucks. You may have noted that several major companies have subsequently followed suit in banning plastic straws to limit their impact on the environment and harm to marine animals. Unfortunately, my repeated efforts to amend annual spending bills funding much of the federal government with language prohibiting federal spending at Donald Trump-owned businesses have been stymied by the House Majority, which has not permitted floor votes. The Constitution prohibits any president from receiving federal spending beyond his salary and I will continue my efforts to ensure the Constitution's prohibition is upheld.   NATO Support Resolution
￼    Last month, while the President was in Brussels insulting our North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) partners, the House passed my resolution supporting NATO and reaffirming our commitment to the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of our allies in Central and Eastern Europe. It was a proud moment and showed that Congress understands the importance of stability and certainty in our diplomatic relations, even if the President does not.   Bringing More Federal Grants Money to Memphis   ￼   My office works closely with federal agencies and with constituents seeking federal grants. Including the Lamar Avenue DOT grant mentioned above, since January 1, the 9th Congressional District has been notified of $132.5 million in federal grants to entities within the District. So far this year, some of the top grantees have been the Memphis Area Transit Authority (MATA), which received a $19.9 million Department of Transportation Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) grant; the Shelby County Board of Education ($11.6 million for Head Start); Christ Community Health Services Inc ($4.5 million); the Memphis Health Center ($4.4 million); and Shelby County Government ($3.5 million for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Emergency Relief).    Signing Up for “Congress On Your Corner” and this e-Newsletter  ￼
I enjoy meeting regularly with constituents in the district and helping get answers for them to questions about dealing with federal agencies. If you are interested in attending one of my “Congress on Your Corner” events, you can sign up here to receive notification as soon as the next event is scheduled.  For those who haven’t participated in a telephone town hall, it’s easy to sign up for them by using this form.  If you would like to receive this weekly e-Newsletter, or share it with others, you can do that with this form.   Weekly Health Tip
Each week, I share a health tip in the hope of promoting a healthy lifestyle for residents of the 9th Congressional District. As always, it is best to check with your doctor before making any changes to your diet, exercise routine or lifestyle.  Almost everyone likes to take a swim when the temperatures hover in the 90s. It’s important to be aware to the “dos” and “don’ts” of public pool or lake swimming. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention compiled some useful “Swim Healthy, Stay Healthy” advice here, including: Don’t Drink Pool Water.   Quote of the Week    ￼    “Any time someone carries a picket sign in front of the White House, that is the First Amendment in action.” – The late NAACP Chairman Julian Bond, in an interview with The Freedom Forum Institute, August 23, 2001.    
As always, I remain,
Most sincerely,
￼

8/1/18 16:18,Reverse the Sales Tax Decision," ￼    ￼   ￼

￼
Montana has never been in the sales tax business.   But now, a Supreme Court ruling is threatening our Montana way of life.  Last month, the court ruled that states can now impose taxes on purchases made over the internet, which means any Montana-based business that sells its products across state lines could be forced to collect taxes on behalf of the nearly 10,000 state and local tax jurisdictions nationwide.
￼
Justice Neil Gorsuch was the deciding vote to impose this controversial decision, which will mean more government red tape for Montana’s small businesses. Since that decision, I have sat down with a few Montana small business owners to talk about what this will do to their operation.  I toured Red Oxx in Billings, a luggage manufacturing company that sells their products to customers around the world.  Red Oxx Owner Jim Markel told me this decision is a “nightmare” and it threatens his business and hurts his bottom line.  I also met with the owners of Big Sky Fulfillment, a shipping company in Missoula. They too told me that they can’t afford a sales tax burden.  “It’ll add a lot of overhead for us to do business,” said CEO Patrick Claytor.  To defend Montana from this threat of a new sales tax, I have introduced the Stop Taxing Our Potential (STOP) Act to overturn this disastrous court decision.  Montanans don’t need Washington telling us how to run our businesses or where to spend our money.  The STOP Act combined with my push to protect Montanans from a national online sales tax will protect our state from those outsiders who continue to try and force a sales tax on Montana families and Montana businesses.

August 1, 2018

Aloha,

I'm pleased that the Senate passed my legislation directing the U.S. Department of Interior to assess the damage being done to Volcanoes National Park, the visitor industry, and the local economy by the ongoing Kilauea eruptions and to work with state and county officials on how to rebuild.  The U.S. Department of Labor has also approved up to $3.5 million that will help with the clean-up efforts in areas on Hawai‘i Island that have been affected by Kilauea.  This support will help the ongoing recovery efforts, and we're grateful for the help of our federal partners.
 We are now accepting applications for our yearly high school internship program.  I always look forward to hearing from our high school interns, and I encourage any seniors who want to make a difference in our state to apply.
 
As always, please contact my office in D.C. or Hawai‘i if there is anything we can do. We are here to help.  Mahalo,  Brian Schatz
United States Senator



Helping Hawai‘i Island Rebuild
The U.S. Senate passed legislation authored by Senator Schatz that will help Hawai‘i Island assess the damage the ongoing Kilauea eruptions has made to federal infrastructure, the visitor industry, and the Hawai‘i Island economy.   “It’s crucial that we understand how our communities and our local economy are being affected by the Kilauea eruptions and earthquakes,” said Senator Schatz, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. “This is one of many steps the federal government can take to help these communities.”
The amendment, included in a bipartisan spending package, will help aid the response and recovery effort by instructing the Department of the Interior to evaluate the damage the eruptions have caused to federal facilities and infrastructure, including Volcanoes National Park, Volcanoes Observatory, and the Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center, and how that has impacted tourism and the local economy. The legislation also asks DOI to work with state and county officials on how to rebuild to support local needs.
Senator Schatz also announced that the U.S. Department of Labor has approved up to $3.5 million in grant funding to the Hawai‘i Department of Labor and Industrial Relations. The Disaster Recovery National Dislocated Worker Grant will employ approximately 175 individuals to help with the clean-up efforts in areas on Hawai‘i Island that have been impacted by the Kilauea eruptions and earthquakes.  “With this funding, many people who are already doing the hard work of cleaning up will be paid for their efforts,” said Senator Schatz, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. “This is one of several steps the federal government has taken to help people rebuild and recover from the volcano, and we’re grateful for the fast and flexible response.”

Supporting Community-Based Restoration
The Kohala Center in Waimea, Hawai‘i will receive a total of $869,931 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to improve land management and strengthen local businesses.  “For nearly two decades, the Kohala Center has built coalitions and harnessed people and resources to restore the watersheds of Kohala, which play an important role in the entire reef ecosystem,” said Senator Schatz, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. “This funding will make sure they can continue to do the work necessary to restore and protect the Kawaihae Watershed.”   The Kohala Center is receiving $853,114 from NOAA to restore the Kawaihae watershed, one of the most degraded watersheds in the region. The project will improve the health and function of the nearshore coral reef ecosystem by addressing erosion caused by animals, deforestation, invasive plants, and wildfire. The funding will allow the center to erect 12 miles of fencing, remove over 1,000 feral goats, plant 2,000 native trees and shrubs, and install 20 sediment capture dams to restore 8,500 acres.   The Kohala Center is receiving another grant for $16,817 from the USDA to help local business through the center’s rural and cooperative business development services program.   Founded in 2000, the Kohala Center is a community-based center for research, conservation, and education that focuses on energy self-reliance, food self-reliance, and ecosystem health in Hawai‘i's rural communities.

Lipinski Joins Problem Solvers Caucus in Proposing Changes to House Rules to ""Break the Gridlock""
￼
Recently, Congressman Dan Lipinski joined with members of the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus at a press conference in the U.S. Capitol to propose a set of changes to the House Rules designed to break the gridlock and make Congress work for the American people. 
“Our Constitution empowered the American people by empowering Congress and their representatives.  But congressional rules are now rigged in a way that greatly diminishes our ability to represent our constituents,” said Rep. Lipinski.  “This has resulted in a Congress that doesn’t work and is frozen in partisan gridlock, allowing the president and the courts to grab the power that is supposed to be held by the American people.  By instituting these proposed reforms, we will begin to restore this power, break partisan gridlock, and facilitate congressional problem solving that will help us build a better America for future generations.” 
In proposing these rules changes, the Caucus aims to encourage and reward consensus driven governing, foster passage of member initiatives solving constituent priorities, and increase accountability and transparency.  The reform package includes proposals to give fast-track priority consideration to bipartisan legislation and guarantees markups on bipartisan legislation from every Member of Congress. 
The Problem Solvers Caucus plans to work with other House Caucuses in the coming weeks to collaborate and help build consensus around House rules changes ahead of the next Congress.
 
 
Lipinski's Veteran, Anti-Terror, Armored Vehicle Safety, Healthcare Innovation, and Small Business Provisions Included in Annual Defense Bill
￼
Several key provisions authored by Rep. Lipinski have been included in the final version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019, H.R. 5515, which passed the House last week and will soon become law.  These provisions will aid veterans, keep military personnel safer, fight terrorism, promote medical innovation, and help small business innovators.
An amendment Lipinski added to the bill on the House floor ensures access to commissaries and morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) facilities for Purple Heart recipients, all veterans with a service-connected disability, Medal of Honor recipients, former prisoners of war, and veteran caregivers.  A 2017 Defense Department report shows that expanding access will not only make lives easier for these veterans, but it will also strengthen the commissary and exchange system.  Lipinski’s provision has been endorsed by the VFW, American Legion, Military Order of the Purple Heart, Wounded Warrior Project, Disabled American Veterans, and AMVETS.  This was based on his legislation, H.R. 5467, the Purple Heart and Disabled Veterans Equal Access Act, which he introduced in April of this year.
For more information about the other Lipinski provisions in the bill, click here.
 
Lipinski: Shuster Draft Infrastructure Plan a Good Start But Needs Work
￼
Congressman Lipinski issued the following statement after the release of House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster’s discussion draft of proposed infrastructure investment legislation:
“More than a year and a half ago, President Trump promised a trillion dollars for much-needed infrastructure, but nothing has been delivered.  This has been a missed opportunity to work on a bipartisan priority that is needed for America’s success.  So I’m pleased that House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster has put out a draft bill that I hope will begin the serious discussion we need to have.  Chairman Shuster’s infrastructure plan is a good start and I commend him for putting forth a serious proposal, but the plan needs work.”
Check out this article by Greg Hinz in Crain’s Chicago Business for more comments about the plan by Congressman Lipinski.

U.S. Defense Bill Seeks to Counter China
Beijing's increased military activity in South China Sea, pursuit of U.S. technology among issues

August 1, 2018
By Kate O'Keeffe
Click here to read in WSJ

￼
Republican Rep. Robert Pittenger of North Carolina has helped lead an effort
to tighten U.S. national-security reviews of Chinese business deals.

￼

Congress is preparing to enact a defense-policy bill that some lawmakers say is tougher on China than any in history, as a bipartisan movement to confront Beijing gathers steam.

The measure, an annual policy bill that will authorize $716 billion in total defense spending for the coming fiscal year, seeks to counter a range of Chinese government policies, including increased military activity in the South China Sea, the pursuit of cutting-edge U.S. technology, and the spread of Communist Party propaganda at American institutions.

The House of Representatives approved the legislation last week, and President Trump is expected to sign the bill into law after the Senate approves it as soon as Wednesday.

This year's National Defense Authorization Act is a reflection of a growing bipartisan consensus in Congress and among national-security officials that the world is entering a new era of great power rivalries in which the U.S. must do more to compete with China and Russia.

""The central challenge to U.S. prosperity and security is the reemergence of long-term, strategic competition,"" according to an unclassified summary of the U.S.'s 2018 National Defense Strategy. ""China is leveraging military modernization, influence operations, and predatory economics to coerce neighboring countries to reorder the Indo-Pacific region to their advantage,"" the document says.

The Chinese Embassy didn't return a request for comment.

Some of the defense bill's most notable provisions concern Chinese economic activity. The legislation seeks to both tighten U.S. national-security reviews of Chinese deals under the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. and to revamp export controls governing which U.S. technologies can be sent abroad.

Though the Cfius provisions, spearheaded by Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) and Rep. Robert Pittenger (R., N.C.), and the export rules, led by Rep. Ed Royce (R., Ca.), are expected to affect a wide array of American businesses, many supported the measures because of a growing concern over Chinese policies.

""Three yeas ago if you talked about doing things against China, the business community would push back,"" said James Lewis, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. ""They don't push back anymore.""

""We have multiple nations out there that are threatening our national security from an economic-espionage perspective, and none of them equal China,"" said Bill Evanina, Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, at an event last week.

The defense bill also requires an annual report on China to include information on efforts by the Chinese government to influence U.S. ""media, cultural institutions, business, and academic and policy communities"" to fall in line with its security strategy.

Another provision limits Department of Defense funds for Chinese language programs at U.S. universities that host Confucius Institutes. These centers, funded by the Chinese government, have been criticized by Republicans - including Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ted Cruz of Texas, as well as Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina - for peddling propaganda.

The bill also contains provisions to bolster defense ties with India and Taiwan, a self-ruled island that China claims as its own. And it bans China's participation in Rim of the Pacific naval exercises - which involve 26 nations in a display of international military cooperation - until it stops militarizing islands in the South China Sea.

""It's a signal to our allies and partners in the region - particularly Australia, Japan and Taiwan - that China's activities in the South China Sea are not accepted as normal,"" said Rachael Burton, deputy director at the Project 2049 Institute, a Virginia-based think tank.

One area in which a bipartisan group of lawmakers thought the defense bill fell short was with respect to Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE Corp. The Commerce Department in April banned U.S. companies from selling to ZTE for failing to honor an earlier U.S. agreement to resolve its sanctions-busting sales to North Korea and Iran. Because ZTE depends on U.S. supplies, the ban was effectively a death knell.

But, in a surprise tweet on May 13, Mr. Trump said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping were ""working together"" to find a way to save ZTE.

The Commerce Department then struck a new deal with ZTE on June 7 that required the Chinese firm to put $400 million into an escrow account, pay a $1 billion fine, replace its board of directors and senior leadership, and fund a team of U.S. compliance officers to monitor the company for 10 years in exchange for being allowed to resume business with U.S. suppliers.

Dissatisfied with Mr. Trump's deal, the Senate on June 18 voted to reinstate the initial Commerce Department penalty on ZTE by wrapping the measure into the defense bill. But Senate and House negotiators removed the language from the final text. The company didn't return a request for comment.

Mr. Rubio has in recent tweets blasted the outcome as a ""cave"" by congressional negotiators.

""We got played by China again,"" he said in a July 24 tweet. ""This can't continue.""

Dear Friends,

Since coming to Congress, I have worked to create an American economy that works for the middle class, not just the corporations, and to foster international trade that works for everyone, not just the corporate lobbyists. I am working to promote more American jobs and higher incomes. This is why I introduced the following legislation this Congress:
	•	In July 2017, I introduced the American Business for American Companies Act (H.R. 3424), which would prevent the federal government from awarding contracts to corporations that change their corporate citizenship from the United States to a country with lower business tax rates, despite keeping their executives and headquarters in America. We cannot continue to allow corporations to pretend that they are American companies, reaping the benefits this country has to offer, all while claiming to be another nationality when the tax bill comes. These corporations are cheating the American people out of revenue that could make a real difference in the lives of children and families, so that they can dodge taxes and gouge prices.   
	•	  
	•	To further hold corporations to their responsibilities to the American people, I introduced the Close Tax Loopholes That Outsource American Jobs Act (H.R. 5145). This bill would close provisions in the Republican Tax Plan which allow American companies to pay lower tax rates for income earned abroad. Removing this provision lowers incentives for outsourcing production and ensures that companies everywhere pay the standard tax rate. Since the 1970s, the Unites States has lost millions of jobs to outsourcing, and the concerns of middle class American workers have been brushed aside by investors and multinational corporations who have taken advantage of opportunities to relocate factories to the places with the laxest labor standards and tax laws. This is why I have spent my career calling for fundamental changes in our economic policies.   
	•	The United States must put in place measures to ensure that foreign investments are not used as a tool by foreign state-owned companies to influence American interests. That is why I introduced the Foreign Investment and Economic Security Act (H.R. 2932) in June 2017, which would ensure that foreign direct investment does not undermine America’s public interests, including our national and economic security. The bill would strengthen federal oversight of foreign investments by creating a new assessment to evaluate how transactions may impact food safety, public health, productivity and economic activity. 
You can be sure that I will continue to fight for economic policies that prioritize working men and women while building up our middle class. 

Sincerely,

￼
Rosa DeLauro

Congresswoman Beatty Leads Letter in Support of Ohio School Safety Grant Application 
Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) sent a letter along with 12 Members of the Ohio Congressional Delegation to the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) in support of the State of Ohio’s applications for grant awards under the Student, Teachers, and Officers Preventing (STOP) School Violence Act Program.
Passed in March, the STOP School Violence Act created a grant program to train students, teachers, school officials, and local law enforcement on how to identify and intervene early when signs of violence arise, develop a coordinated reporting system, and implement FBI and Secret Service-based school threat assessment protocols to prevent school shootings before they happen.
“We owe it to every student, in every classroom across America, to do everything in our power to minimize the threat of gun violence,” Beatty said. “Unfortunately, many children and their parents are rightly concerned and are calling on Congress to act.” Beatty continued, “In that spirit, I join my congressional colleagues in urging BJA to provide the needed resources and support to ensure that Ohio schools and those in every community are safer places of learning.”

Preparing our Workforce 
           ￼ 
Dear Friends,  
Since the 2008 recession, I have been hearing the same concern from Rhode Island business owners: they’re unable to find skilled workers to fill open positions, and it’s hurting their companies. This skills gap impedes economic growth and prevents workers from finding jobs. As a co-chair of the Congressional Career and Technical Education (CTE) Caucus, one of my top priorities is strengthening our CTE programs so that students graduate career-ready and equipped with the necessary skills to join the workforce.  
That’s why I am pleased to report that after years of work, Congress has approved an update to the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, which funds important CTE programs in Rhode Island and across the country. Just yesterday, this bipartisan legislation, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, was signed into law by the President.  
I was a coauthor of the bill, and it includes several of my policy priorities, including expanding access to apprenticeships and providing support for career counselors. The bill also increases federal investment and realigns our CTE programs to better match industry needs by bringing businesses in as stakeholders during program development. We have a proud tradition in this country of local control of education, and it is important that federal assistance reflects the immediate needs of the community.  
Many students will take an educational journey that culminates in a four-year college degree. Others will find that a two-year degree or certificate program appeals to them. Still others will plan on leaving high school to start their careers. What’s important is that we give students the opportunity to choose by investing in all of these pathways and offering guidance as to which option is right for them. The new law the President signed yesterday will help both students and employers in our state, and I was proud to play a part in its passage.  
For more information on career and technical education, and for updates on many other issues, please visit my website and follow me on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.  
            Sincerely,  
           ￼

Keeping Gun Dealers Honest 
I was proud to receive the support of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Congressman David Cicilline, and several other Rhode Island leaders and advocates as we called on Congress to finally address the gun violence epidemic and pass my Keeping Gun Dealers Honest Act. This legislation will increase accountability measures on the bad-acting gun dealers that are the source of the vast majority of guns used in violent crime in the United States. 
  
￼ 
Funding for Firefighters 
Rhode Island fire departments in Narragansett and in the Woonasquatucket Fire League recently received nearly one million dollars in federal funding through an important grant program. Recently, I had the opportunity to join the Providence Fire Department to showcase their new rescue ambulance, which also received federal support. We owe so much to our first responders, and I’m proud to support programs in Congress that help better protect them.

Dear Friends,

What has Congress done?

So far, the 115th Congress, which began on January 3, 2017, has sent 224 bills to the President that he has signed into law.  In addition, the House has passed 894, many of them by a wide margin, which have not yet been considered in the Senate. 
 
Below are some highlights of issues we have addressed so far, including bills that I have introduced; as well as links to more information. 
 
TAX REFORM
Last December, the tax reform bill, H.R. 1, was signed into law.  This marks the most significant overhaul of our federal tax code in over 30 years.  Beyond lowering individual and corporate tax rates, doubling the standard deduction, and eliminating many special interest deductions, the tax reform bill eliminates the Obamacare individual mandate penalty beginning in January 1, 2019.  Congress may take up another tax  bill, potentially this September, to implement even more tax reforms.   
 
Although the tax reform bill was not perfect, I believe that many individuals, families, and businesses in the 13th District have seen and will continue to see significant relief from this tax reform.

FARM BILL
About every five years, Congress debates the Farm Bill, which provides our hardworking agriculture producers with essential tools and the safety net they need to grow the food and fiber our country needs and relies upon.  It also includes several other policies that support rural America as well as nutrition programs that assist those who are truly in need.
 
H.R. 2, the ""Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018,"" passed the House.  The Senate has also passed its own version of the 2018 Farm Bill, and the differences between the two bills are being worked out in conference.  One key difference is that the House requires able-bodied food stamp recipients to be improving their job skills.

HEALTHCARE
We continue to have enormous problems in our American health care system.  Many people are seeing higher insurance premiums and fewer options for coverage.  The American Health Care Act (AHCA), which passed the House but failed the Senate by one vote, repeals and replaces the worst parts of Obamacare and puts more decisions in the hands of patients and their health care professionals.  
 
Although the Senate has been unable to pass any version of a health care bill, the House has continued to work to reform Obamacare.  Just last week, the House passed several bills to boost Health Savings Accounts (HSA), allow catastrophic health insurance coverage on the exchanges, and delay and repeal Obamacare taxes that increase the cost of coverage.  We must continue to work for ways to stop the harmful effects of Obamacare, control costs, and put patients in charge of their health care.  
 
Click here to learn more: https://thornberry.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398345
 
DODD-FRANK
Over the past few years, financial regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act have made it almost impossible for mid- and small-sized banks and credit unions to operate.  We cannot expect our community banks to meet the needs of rural America if they have to comply with the same burdensome regulations as larger international banks.  Congress has been working to roll back many of the burdensome Obama-era regulations.
 
S. 2155, the “Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act,"" which has been signed into law, reforms a number of harmful policies put in place under Dodd-Frank.  It provides much needed regulatory relief to community banks and credit unions and increases consumer protections to further strengthen our economy and help grow incomes.

OPIOIDS
Pain management is so important and something that so many Americans cannot live without, but prescriptions should not lead to a life-threatening addiction.  This year the House has passed a number of bills to combat this epidemic, including House-passed H.R. 6, which modifies Medicare and Medicaid coverage and other policies to help treat and prevent substance abuse disorders.  
 
Our country is facing an epidemic that affects us at home. The federal government alone cannot solve it, but it can help.

VETERANS AFFAIRS
It is past time to provide our country’s veterans with an updated Veterans Affairs (VA)  program and to make sure that their process is efficient and timely.  These men and women have put their lives on the line for our freedom, and they deserve the best care when they return home.
 
Congress has passed a number of veterans bills this Congress including S. 2372, the ""VA MISSION Act of 2018,"" which has been signed into law.  This bill will ensure veterans have timely access to the care they have earned and is appropriately named, as it will put the department back on track to fulfilling President Lincoln’s promise to care for the men and women who have borne the battle.

HUMAN TRAFFICKING 
Human trafficking is a serious problem both at home and abroad.  The House has passed several bills to directly combat human trafficking.  As a result, online advertising for commercial sex trafficking has gone down by 60—80%, but much more remains to be done.  I fully support the efforts of the federal government and private organizations to end this global issue.

LEGISLATION I SPONSORED
Opioids epidemic - I offered an amendment to H.R. 2851, the ""Stop the Importation and Trafficking of Synthetic Analogues Act of 2017,"" which passed the House, that mirrors the ""Synthetic Abuse and Labeling of Toxic Substances (SALTS) Act"" that I reintroduced earlier this year.  Currently, synthetic drug producers, manufacturers, and sellers can easily skirt regulations by simply adding a “not for human consumption” label on their product.  This issue has been a serious challenge for law enforcement in our area, and this amendment helps close that loophole.  
 
Red River - The “Red River Gradient Boundary Survey Act,” H.R. 428, which passed the House, establishes a fair and balanced process to conduct an accurate survey of contested land along the Red River to find the proper boundary between public and private ownership.  Funding to conduct the Red River survey was included in the Fiscal Year 2018 Interior Appropriations Bill that was signed into law.  Additionally, language was included in the House-passed Fiscal Year 2019 Interior Appropriations Bill to ensure that the Red River survey is conducted by independent, third-party surveyors who are chosen by the states and licensed and qualified to conduct official gradient boundary surveys. 
 
J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Mary Lou Robinson United States Courthouse - I sponsored H.R. 5772, to designate the J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Courthouse in Amarillo, Texas, as the “J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Mary Lou Robinson United States Courthouse,” which passed the House.  Senator John Cornyn has introduced a similar bill in the Senate. 
 
Beef Grading - I offered an amendment to the 2018 Farm Bill, which was adopted on the House floor, to establish “Cattle and Carcass Grading Correlation and Training Centers” to help ensure that federal beef graders are interpreting and applying the USDA standards in the same way so that cattle and carcasses across the country are graded uniformly.  This change will benefit producers and consumers alike.
 
Rural Broadband - I also helped developed two rural broadband amendments to the 2018 Farm Bill, which were adopted by the House.  The first amendment allows the USDA to finance “middle-mile” infrastructure projects, which are necessary to connect rural areas to the backbone of the Internet.  The second directs the USDA to study potential opportunities to provide technical assistance and predevelopment planning activities to help rural counties and communities assess current and future broadband needs.
 
Armed Services - The House passed H.R. 5515, the ""National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019.""   This NDAA authorizes $717 billion in spending for defense needs, including significant increases for readiness recovery, and it fully funds a 2.6 percent pay raise for our troops, the highest increase in 9 years.  Final Senate action should be soon, after which the bill will be sent to the President.  
 
This year will be the first time that Congress has passed the annual Defense Authorization Bill on time in 12 years.

Congressman Boyle's July Newsletter
Dear Friend, 
I hope your summer has been safe and enjoyable so far. Over the past few weeks, I’ve been hard at work in Washington, and I wanted to take a moment to update you on some of the things I’ve fought for as your Representative in Congress. 
On July 17th, I repeated by demand for the EPA to set enforceable standards on the level of PFOS and PFOA chemicals allowed in our drinking water. Republicans unanimously rejected the amendment I introduced and have been stalling my legislation. This came just three weeks after I joined my Pennsylvania congressional colleague from across the aisle, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, in a bipartisan call for more government action on PFAS drinking water contamination in areas surrounding the Horsham and Willow Grove military bases.  
 ￼ 
On July 12th, I met with the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michael Barnier to hear the latest on these important negotiations. As I have been saying from the beginning, it is absolutely vital that we maintain a strong relationship with both the UK and the EU during this process. This is more important than ever as the executive branch repeatedly undermines our transatlantic relationships.
￼ 
On July 13th, I was pleased to be visited by members of the Penn State Philadelphia 4H youth group. We discussed how to become active in civics and how to be better engaged citizens. It was inspiring to see so many young people looking to get involved! 
￼ 
On July 16th, I was shocked and horrified, like many of you, after hearing President Trump take the word of Vladimir Putin over that of the American intelligence community regarding Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. I immediately and forcefully condemned President Trump’s comments, and on July 24th I introduced a resolution demanding that the administration release its preparatory documents for the unprecedented closed-door Trump-Putin meeting. Rather than taking Trump and Putin’s word, the public has a right to know what was covered in the secretive meeting, and Congress must exercise its oversight duties.
On July 18th, I had the privilege of meeting with two leaders of the Teamsters union to discuss what Congress can do to support America’s working people. As a founder and co-chair of the Blue Collar Caucus, I'm doing everything I can to get a better deal for workers.  
 ￼ 
On July 23rd, I spoke at the dedication ceremony to rename the Wyncote Post Office for Staff Sergeant Peter Taub, a brave soldier from our community who lost his life in combat in Afghanistan. The event was the culmination of months of hard work getting a law passed to officially change the post office’s name. It was an honor to be able to thank the late Sgt. Taub and his family for their sacrifices and service to our country. 
￼

If you want to learn more about this heroic Pennsylvanian, NBC did a nice feature honoring Sgt. Taub, which you can watch here.

Dear Friend,

Recently, Majority Whip Steve Scalise and I wrote an op-ed sharing how President Trump is helping to restore our nation's religious liberty. Our article ran in the Washington Times, and I want to share it with you. 

Restoring Religious Liberty
Steve Scalise and Randy Weber

One of the greatest things about America is our constitutionally protected right to practice our faith and live out our religious beliefs free from interference by our government. Unfortunately, over the last few decades our nation has seen a wave of attacks against religious freedom — from government overreach to activist judges and others who wish to remove more elements of faith from our national life.

From lawsuits demanding war memorials be torn down because they contain religious symbolism to the IRS’ ability to threaten religious groups for what they say from the pulpit to the Obama administration’s attempts to force groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor to defy their deeply held religious beliefs, we’ve seen a systematic effort to remove any mention of God from the public space and to chip away at our sacred right to live out our faith free from government obstruction.

Thankfully, under President Trump’s leadership, we are starting to turn the tide and restore the liberties our nation’s Founders enshrined in our Constitution. This summer, we saw the U.S. Supreme Court deliver a crucial victory for religious freedom when it struck down the State of California’s efforts to force pro-life health care providers to actually promote abortion. The government should not force citizens to act against their faith. By a 5-4 margin, our nation’s highest court stopped California’s unconstitutional attempts to do just that.

Think about that: A 5-4 margin. Had Hillary Clinton won the presidential election, she would have appointed a liberal activist judge to the Supreme Court, resulting in the court ruling the opposite way and striking another blow to religious freedom instead of protecting it.

When asking for the American people’s support in 2016, Donald Trump produced a list of strong, constitutional conservatives from which he would choose a nominee. He followed through on his promise by nominating Neil Gorsuch. Now, with Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement, President Trump has once again nominated a jurist, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who shows respect for our Constitution and commitment to protecting American rights, including our religious freedoms.

Judge Kavanaugh has demonstrated this commitment since the 1990s. He took on pro bono cases, standing up for religious freedom and advocating on behalf of judges who share his respect for our Constitutional rights, including freedom of religion. As a federal judge, he stood up to the Obama administration by defending the Priests for Life right to live according to their religious beliefs. His will be a powerful voice as he continues defending our constitutional rights and freedoms, once confirmed by the Senate to the Supreme Court.

Again — just think of where our nation would be if Hillary Clinton were president and had the chance to stack our highest court with not one, but two far-left liberal judges. It would have struck a huge blow to our nation and changed America for decades to come, allowing the left to foist a bigger, more intrusive government on Americans at the expense of our liberties.

Thankfully, with Mr. Trump, we are seeing the exact opposite, and while we need to keep fighting on behalf of our freedoms, the future is looking bright.

In Congress, we are working to secure even greater protections to religious liberties. That’s why we proudly led the effort in the House to repeal the ill-conceived Johnson Amendment so that the IRS can no longer threaten the free speech rights of religious leaders and their congregations. We join Mr. Trump in encouraging the U.S. Senate to do the same, so that he can sign this repeal into law — something Hillary Clinton would have refused to do.

Just when it seemed we were on a disastrous course, where our own government was undermining religious freedom at every turn, the American people stood up and demanded a change in direction. Under Mr. Trump, our government is now playing its proper role by defending our rights rather than threatening or treading upon them. He is keeping his promises to Americans of all faiths who felt marginalized by President Obama and others on the left. We are proud to stand with him and with all Americans who value faith and freedom.

• Steve Scalise, a Republican U.S. representative from Louisiana, is the House Majority Whip. Randy Weber is a Republican U.S. representative from Texas.

I wanted to give you a quick update about the work I'm continuing to do in Washington and the District.  Serving in the Marine Corps as a General Officer was one of the greatest privileges and honors of my life, and that experience helped prepare me for the job you sent me to do in Congress.   The needs in Houghton after the floods differ greatly from the needs of sportsmen in Alpena and Cedarville dealing with cormorants, as do the diplomacy talks and national security issues associated with North and South Korea. However, each of these situations are important to me and our District, and I've continued working directly on each with a focused effort.   Hands-on Leadership in South Korea After a phenomenal First District Independence Day, I had the unique opportunity to take a bipartisan Congressional diplomatic trip to South Korea. As we all know, the Korean Peninsula has been the focal point of many discussions in recent weeks, and I was privileged to be part of the very first Congressional trip to the Korean Peninsula since President Trump's historic summit with North Korea. Leadership in South Korea is cautiously optimistic that progress being made will last, but we must never take our eyes off the goal -- a verifiable, denuclearized North Korea. I was able to see firsthand the progress being made, and offer leadership to my colleagues as a retired Marine Corps General.   Natural Resources The Great Lakes are one of our nation's most treasured natural resources, and I will continue to fight to protect, preserve, and conserve them. I was honored to speak at the ground breaking ceremony for the new Lake Superior State University Center for Great Lakes Research on July 20 in the Soo. The work that will be accomplished here, and in facilities like it all around the District, will ensure our treasured Great Lakes remain the best place for our kids and grandkids to work, play, and live.   As you may have heard, the House Committee on Natural Resources passed my bill -- The Cormorant Relief Act-- which will allow states to resume depredation of cormorants until Fish and Wildlife is able to complete its studies,ensuring our free-swimming fish population in northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula is preserved. There’s positive momentum behind this bill, and I'm excited to keep you informed on its progress in the days and weeks ahead.   Additionally, I've co-sponsored the Recovering America's Wildlife Act, which has gained energy in recent days. I'm proud of the bipartisan work we’re doing on this bill, and I'll keep you updated on future developments. You can read the bill in its entirety HERE.  In Conclusion We've accomplished much together over these past 18 months, and I'm energized about the days and weeks ahead. There’s a lot left to do, and I look forward to continue sharing the positive results we’re achieving with you.
Sincerely, Jack Bergman

News from Representative Ryan Costello
￼ 

Welcome to my weekly e-newsletter, Ryan's Report, and thank you for reading. The House was in session for a busy week of votes, committee hearings, and meetings with constituents. This was the last week of votes in the House until September. Next week, the August District Work Period begins and I will update you again at the end of the summer.
Update on Trade 
￼ 
The tariffs announced by President Trump in March and their impact on our communities have been a continued focus of mine and an issue constituents regularly address with my office. I joined CNN this week to discuss the announcement made by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that it would allocate up to $12 billion in assistance for farmers. I reiterated that the retaliation taking place by other countries is a self-inflicted wound and going to be very damaging to our farmers and agricultural sector. 
During the interview, I noted that using a credit facility - specifically, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), which was created during the Great Depression to create a subsidy for farmers, while we hopefully bring about a reduction in barriers is something that gives me great pause because we do not know what the strategy is or what the end result may be. But we do know in the meantime that cost to American farmers, for example, in getting dairy or soy beans to market in foreign countries, has been reduced. 
My hope is that this $12 billion is the backstop that farmers need during this point in time. While I and many others can be critical of this $12 billion subsidy, I think we need it as a result of the President imposing these tariffs. To be clear, we want our farmers to be able to stand on their own and earn an income without the help of subsidies. 
July 23 - July 27: Support for Pennsylvania's Workforce, Servicemembers, Healthcare, & Connectivity 
Pennsylvania's Workforce for the Future 
This week, the House took final steps on H.R. 2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education (CTE) for the 21st Century Act - legislation I have long supported. For over three decades, the Carl D. Perkins CTE Act (Perkins Act) has provided the legal framework for federal investment in state and local career and technical education CTE programs. 
In our community, the Perkins Act helps support the work of schools in their mission to equip students with the high-quality education and hands-on experience necessary to enter the workforce or take their careers to the next level. But it has been nearly 11 years since the Perkins Act was updated, and students, educators, and employers are all feeling the effects of operating under an outdated policy structure.  
This bill, which was just signed into law, marks an important milestone in our efforts to support students, equip our workforce, and strengthen our local economies for decades to come, with a few noteworthy highlights:
	•	
	•	Increases flexibility in how states use Perkins funding by increasing from 10 percent to 15 percent the amount of federal funding states can allocate to support CTE programs that specifically align with local priorities.
	•	In Pennsylvania, where we are facing a shortage of skilled workers in the precision manufacturing industry, H.R. 2353 will allow state and local leaders to target additional resources to address this particular need, among others.
	•	In addition, H.R. 2353 will improve coordination between educators and employers by requiring Perkins funding recipients to consult regularly with local stakeholders to ensure programs are aligned appropriately with industry needs. This important provision will help strengthen curriculums and preserve the integrity of CTE programs to ensure they equip students with the right knowledge and skills for success in their chosen industry.
As a member of the Congressional CTE Caucus and the co-chair of the Congressional 21st Century Skills Caucus, I'm pleased to see this bill become law. Click here for the full op-ed I wrote in support of this bill last year. I will continue working to advance legislative solutions to ensure all students are equipped for success in our dynamic 21st century economy.
Eliminating Burdensome Fees for Deploying Servicemembers 
￼
￼
Click above to watch my floor speech on my bill 
I'm excited to report my bipartisan legislation in support of servicemembers and their families passed the House this week. When servicemembers receive military orders to deploy or relocate, they should not have to deal with burdensome fees during their moving process. H.R. 2409, which I introduced with Congressman Derek Kilmer (D-WA), would ensure servicemembers can terminate their pay TV and Internet access service contracts while deployed without incurring early termination fees.  
Under current law, similar protections are granted to servicemembers with active duty orders for long-term civil agreements, such as rental leases, automobile leases, and cellphone contracts. This legislation would update the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to include pay TV and internet service contracts when they have military orders to move or deploy. While relief provisions do exist in some states, this legislation would enact a policy at the federal level so that all our country’s servicemembers and their families are provided uniform assistance. 
Click here for more information on my legislation, H.R. 2409 and click here to read about my bill in the Daily Local News. 
Veterans Legislation Passed This Week 
	•	H.R. 2787: Veterans-Specific Education for Tomorrow’s Medical Doctors (VET MD) Act: This legislation would create a pilot program to improve the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) ability to recruit and employ young medical professionals to work at the VA by providing clinical observation opportunities at the VA. The program would aim to raise awareness, understanding, and knowledge of medical issues commonly faced by veterans, and to increase the diversity pool of individuals applying to become a physician at the VA. 
	•	H.R. 5649: Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William ‘Bill’ Mulder (Ret.) Transition Improvements Act: This bill would make improvements to the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), which assists veterans in their transition from service to civilian life, by directing TAP to focus more on careers and entrepreneurship. 
	•	H.R. 5882: Gold Star Spouses Leasing Relief Act: This legislation would allow servicemembers' surviving spouses to end a residential lease at the time of a servicemember's death without facing an early termination fee.
	•	H.R. 5864: VA Hospitals Establishing Leadership Performance Act: To ensure individuals hired to assist veterans at the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) are qualified, this legislation would require the VA to implement qualifications and metrics for Human Resources (HR) employees at the VHA - a House Committee on Veterans Affairs investigation found that some VHA HR employees were underqualified for their important role.
	•	H.R. 5938: Veterans Serving Veterans Act: In order to help fill vacancies at the VA that could be filled by qualified veterans, this legislation would require the VA to identify servicemembers who are returning to civilian life in the near future and recruit them for VA openings based on their military occupational specialties. The legislation also requires the VA to recruit and train former military medics as intermediate care technicians.
Support for Medical Innovation 
￼ 
Thousands of Pennsylvanians are employed by medical device companies, and Southeastern Pennsylvania is a hub for medical innovation. Since coming to Congress, permanently repealing the 2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices has been a priority of mine. This ill-conceived tax is not only a job killer in PA6, but it devalues and decelerates innovation and invention that's intended to improve public health outcomes and lower healthcare costs. While we were able to enact a 2-year delay on this tax back in 2016, I have continued to make the case that we need to put patients and innovation first, and permanently remove this tax from the books. This week, the House passed a bill that does just that - H.R. 184, the Protect Medical Innovation Act. I hope to report back that it gets signed into law before the end of this year. 
Click here and here for more information on the work I've done on this issue.

Legislation On The House Floor This Week 
Healthcare Legislation 
	•	H.R. 6199: Restoring Access to Medication and Modernizing Health Savings Accounts Act: This legislation would help more people access Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) by improving HSA rules and flexibility - such as allowing over-the-counter medicines, feminine products, and certain sports and fitness activities to be purchased with certain HSA dollars, or for certain dollars to be rolled over from other tax-advantaged health accounts to fund HSAs.
	•	H.R. 6311: Increasing Access to Lower Premiums Plans and Expanding Health Savings Accounts Act: This legislation would increase the amount that can be contributed to an HSA, allow more people to qualify to contribute to an HSA, allow Flexible Spending Arrangement (FSA) funds to be rolled over to the next year, make bronze and catastrophic plans with high deductibles on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchanges eligible for HSAs, and postpone the ACA's health insurance tax (HIT) for another two years.
	•	H.R. 1201: Equitable Access to Care and Health (EACH) Act: This legislation would expand the religious conscience exemption from the individual mandate in the ACA to include those who would have to act against their religious beliefs to receive medical health services.
	•	H.R. 1676: Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act: I cosponsor this legislation, which would improve the training of healthcare professionals in the palliative care field through grant programs.
	•	H.R. 3728: Educating Medical Professionals and Optimizing Workforce Efficiency Readiness (EMPOWER) Act: This legislation would reauthorize workforce programs that support loan repayment and training programs in medical professions, such as Training in General Pediatric and Public Health Dentistry grants, Public Health Workforce grants, and the Health Professions Training for Diversity Program.
	•	H.R. 5385: Dr. Benjy Frances Brooks Children’s Hospital Graduate Medical Education (GME) Support Reauthorization Act: This bill would reauthorize the children’s GME program, which provides funding for training of pediatric medical officials at hospitals with graduate medical education programs - including the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).  It is important to support this critical workforce, and I am a cosponsor of this legislation. Last year, I also helped to introduce legislation to expand the current cap on the number of Medicare-supported training slots for doctors, helping to ensure teaching hospitals can meet the growing demands for physicians as our nation faces a looming doctor shortage. To read more about that effort, please click here.   
Improving Connectivity 
	•	H.R. 2345: National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act: This legislation, which I cosponsor, would direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to collaborate to examine the development of an easy to remember emergency number for the suicide hotline. In addition, a section of the bill looks for both agencies to work on specifically improving services for veterans. This legislation reflects the critical intersection of health and technology, and how we can utilize technology to improve lives.
	•	H.R. 959: Title VIII Nursing Workforce Reauthorization Act: I am also a cosponsor of this legislation, which would provide financial assistance, education, and training to nurses. As a member of the Congressional Nursing Caucus, I have previously written about my commitment to this important sector of our country’s healthcare workforce. Click here to read some of my thoughts. 
	•	H.R. 4881: Precision Agriculture Connectivity Act: Precision agriculture is the use of technology, such as drones and the Internet of Things (IoT), in agriculture. This legislation would direct the FCC to work with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to study how to best implement the broadband needs for precision agriculture - as many farmers and ranchers live in rural areas that have less broadband access.
	•	H.R. 5709: Preventing Illegal Radio Abuse Through Enforcement (PIRATE) Act: This legislation would allow the FCC to fine anyone who is found to broadcast over AM or FM frequencies without an FCC license or without being in compliance with the FCC's unlicensed operation rules - known as pirate radio stations.
	•	H.R. 3994: Advancing Critical Connectivity Expands Service, Small Businesses Resources, Opportunities, Access, and Data Based on Assessed Need and Demand (ACCESS BROADBAND) Act: This legislation would create the Office of Internet Connectivity and Growth within the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to help promote access and understanding of broadband. The office would work with communities that need assistance with access to high-speed internet, create broadband training for various communities, and track the construction of broadband infrastructure built with federal support.
	•	
National Flood Insurance Program Extension 
	•	House Amendment to S. 1182: National Flood Insurance Program Extension Act: This bill will provide for a short-term reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program and was signed into law.
Improving Constituent Services
	•	H.R. 3500: Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act: This legislation would prohibit the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from rehiring anyone who previously worked for the IRS and who was terminated involuntarily or for misconduct.
	•	H.R. 6084: Improving Social Security’s Service to Victims of Identity Theft Act: This legislation requires the Social Security Administration to provide one point of contact for anyone who requires assistance with the misuse of their Social Security Number.
National Security and Defense 
H.R. 5954: Anti-terrorism Clarification Act: This legislation would update the Antiterrorism Act of 1992 to ensure those committing or aiding terror acts are held accountable and American victims can seek an appropriate path of justice.
Conference Report to Accompany of H.R. 5515: National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019: The most basic responsibility of the federal government is the defense of our country, and the resources provided for these programs come first through a framework bill – the NDAA -- before being appropriated through the Defense Appropriations Act. This week, the House agreed to the Conference Report on H.R. 5515, the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019 (FY19). This is the final House action on the NDAA. 
This legislation is important to ensuring our military has the resources necessary to carry out their national security objectives, including funding and efforts to begin to close the readiness gaps our troops are facing. The legislation also prioritizes our troops and includes provisions to protect the health of servicemembers and their families when they return home.  
The FY19 NDAA authorizes: 
	•	2.6 percent pay raise for troops
	•	Funding for military readiness, including for training; replacing or rehabilitating equipment; and for repairing or rebuilding military infrastructure
	•	Advancing technology that will help the U.S. address new and emerging threats

Energy and Commerce Corner Recap

Communications and Technology Subcommittee Hearing: Speaking with Commissioners from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 
Concerns about cybersecurity were a big component of this particular hearing, and members on the Subcommittee, including myself, asked the Commissioners about their role in cybersecurity issues. The concern over cybersecurity and supply chain vulnerabilities is certainly well founded, and I noted how my understanding is that the FCC is not and should not play a lead role (I emphasized lead role) on identifying and mitigating these vulnerabilities, as the Commission has a long history of deferring to expert agencies within the executive branch that have the relevant intelligence and national security expertise. For example, the FCC routinely refers applications for transfers of certain licenses to an informal working group in the executive branch known as Team Telecomm to review the national security implications of each such transaction. 
I asked Commissioner O’Rielly if he believes the FCC has anything new or unique to add to our nation's cybersecurity work or if the intelligence and national security agencies currently have a good handle on these issues. Commissioner O’Rielly said that he does not believe the FCC has the authority to act unless Congress changes their authority. He also said the FCC works well with Team Telecomm but he has advocated for some reforms to Team Telecomm - including the timing of the decisions and changes to have a better, efficient government. Overall, he said the agencies are capable of providing the FCC with the information as it relates to the applications that are submitted for consideration.  
I also asked the Commissioners to discuss telehealth, which can have exponential benefits for patients, families, and the entire healthcare community, as well as improve access for rural patients - about what can we expect to come out of the Connected Care Pilot Program and what kind of job creation will there be from the increased investment of telehealth technologies. Commissioner Carr discussed improving health outcomes and significant cost savings for rural America. Chairman Pai talked about the strides being made between the private sector and the FCC to help veterans and other individuals in rural parts of the country.

Oversight and Investigations (O&I) Subcommittee Hearing: Examining Advertising and Marketing Practices within the Substance Use Treatment Industry 
The O&I Subcommittee held a hearing this week to examine advertising and marketing in the substance use treatment industry, a topic of particular importance as the opioid epidemic continues. During the hearing, I had the opportunity to ask leadership from substance use treatment centers how each organization uses advertising, including whether the organization uses marketing standards that are enforced in their advertising, how calls are generated to treatment providers, and how much a treatment center pays for a call. 
In addition, I asked about the use of success rates in advertising. One witness, Mark Mishek, responded that Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation does not use the word success but they use outcomes - as addiction is a chronic disease. He added that they measure outcomes after one year of being with the treatment center and do not advertise their outcomes. Michael Cartwright, with American Addiction Centers, said his organization conducted an outcome study of 4,000 patients that American Addiction Centers published and released, but it does not include all individuals going through treatment annually. Finally, Robert Niznik said Addiction Recovery Now and Niznik Behavioral Health does not advertise what their success rate is or define it in any of their ads.

The August District Work Period begins next week.

Dear Friend,

I am pleased to announce the launch of the 2018 Congressional App Challenge for California’s 26th District – a competition for middle school and high school students to create their own software applications and learn more about programming and how they can help their communities through technology and innovation.

Coding and computer science skills open doors of opportunity for young people across the nation, and what better way to learn more about these important fields than through hands-on experience. If you know a student who is interested in STEM, coding, or creating their own app, I encourage them to participate. Students of all coding experiences are welcome.

More information about the Congressional App Challenge, as well as how to register, can be found here. Students must register by September 10, 2018 to participate. Final submissions are due by October 15, 2018.

￼ 
Dear Friend,
Our Founders enshrined the Census as a pillar of our democracy, ensuring that all Americans are equally counted and represented. I believe the Administration’s plan to add a new citizenship question violates the clear Constitutional mandate to provide an accurate count of every person living in the United States. This dangerous change will inject fear and distrust into vulnerable communities and cause traditionally undercounted communities to be even further under-represented.
By adding a citizenship question, districts like ours could be undercounted and starved of vital funding, threatening the security, safety, and health of American families.
You can make your voice heard on the addition of a citizenship question in the 2020 Census. The Commerce Department is accepting comments from the public here. 
Feel free to forward this email and tell your friends and family to sign up to receive updates on the work we're doing in Washington, DC, and at home in Illinois.
Remember, I am here to work for you. If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to e-mail me, call my office, or connect with me on Facebook and Twitter.
Sincerely,

Thune-Supported Bill to Strengthen Career and Technical Education is Signed into Law
 
This week, President Trump signed into law the bipartisan Strengthening Career and Technical Education (CTE) for the 21st Century Act, which will modernize our nation’s CTE programs and prepare students for the modern workforce.
 
This new law will help address the increasing demand for workers with technical skills by providing additional resources to states and eligible education institutions to help them train and better prepare students for careers in high-demand fields. Among other things, it will also encourage collaboration and the development of partnerships between states, schools, and private industry to help identify workforce needs and narrow the skilled workforce gap that continues to exist in communities across the nation.

Dear Lindsey,
  I am pleased to invite high school-aged students who live or attend school in the Fourth District to participate in my annual Congressional App Challenge. Please feel free to share this information with any students you know who may be interested in participating, or with teachers, administrators, or others with an interest in computer science or technology development.
The Congressional App Challenge asks students to create an original application, or “app”, for a mobile device, tablet, or computer. Students may work individually or in groups of up to four to design an app on a topic of their choosing. Entrants are not required to submit the source of code for the app – only a brief video that explains the app’s purpose. To sign up for the App Challenge, students should visit CongressionalAppChallenge.us. Apps are due by noon on October 15.
To inspire and assist students in the creation and design process, I will be hosting a student Hackathon on Saturday, September 8 from 9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. at Fidelity Investments in Research Triangle Park. The event will feature workshops on “design thinking” and public speaking. The event is free, and lunch will be provided to participants. Students are asked to bring a laptop, but those in need of a laptop can reserve one by contacting my office at 202-225-1784. To attend the Hackathon, students should RSVP at https://CongressionalAppChallengeHackathon.eventbrite.com no later than Wednesday, September 5.
App Challenge submissions will be judged by a panel of local science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) leaders from industry and academia, and finalists will have the opportunity to pitch their app to a panel of judges at an event in November. All App Challenge participants, parents, teachers, and administrators will be invited to join me at this event, the details of which will be provided to participants upon submission of their app. The winners will also have their work displayed in the Capitol building and will be invited to a reception in Washington, D.C.!
Please feel free to share this exciting opportunity with others. If you have any questions regarding the Congressional App Challenge, please contact my Washington D.C. Office at 202-225-1784.  
Sincerely, 
￼

Post Office Renamed To Honor Local Fallen Hero
Dear Friend, 
This week, I was honored to host a ceremony renaming the Wyncote Post Office after Staff Sergeant Peter Taub, a brave soldier from our community who lost his life in combat in Afghanistan. The ceremony was a culmination of months of hard work getting a law passed through Congress to change the name to honor the local hero. But that work was nothing compared to what Sgt. Taub’s family has endured over his years of service and his passing. 
Staff Sergeant Peter Taub was a shining example of the best our country has to offer. In his service to our nation, he exemplified unwavering patriotism and heroic bravery. Renaming this post office in his hometown is the least we can do to honor him, to make his service a permanent fixture in his local community. It represents a small but important symbol of our eternal thanks, both to him and to his family.
I hope the renaming of the post office helps Staff Sergeant Peter Taub’s name endure through history. I hope it inspires people to devote their lives to helping their community, as Sergeant Taub did.
